    <p> Europe - Focus Europe Special - Mark Wall.<br/><br/>
        We expect a short press conference on 14 December. After last month'sannouncements, we expect no new policies to
        be unveiled. The two topics themarket could focus on are the updated staff forecasts and the internal ECB
        debateon forward guidance.<br/><br/>
        Global Rates Strategy - Global Fixed Income Outlook 2018 - Francis Yared.<br/><br/>
        We expect 10Y UST to approach 3%, Bunds to approach 1% and Gilts to approach2% by the end of next year. Rising
        core inflation and easier fiscal and regulatorypolicies will support further monetary policy tightening in 2018.
        Central bankswill continue tightening the monetary policy screw that started with the BoJ¡¯sadoption of the yield
        curve control (YCC) mechanism in the fall of 2016.<br/><br/>
        Credit Strategy - US Fixed Income Outlook 2018 - Aleksandar Kocic.<br/><br/>
        We expect yields to climb over the course of 2018, driven at first by marketpricing of a higher terminal short
        rate, and later in the year by a recovery of theterm premium. Our forecasts are based upon an expected end-2019
        short rateof 2.45%.<br/><br/>
        Credit Strategy - Early Morning Reid - Jim Reid.<br/><br/>
        A reminder that we published our 2018 Credit Outlook "The Shrinking Safety Net"last Monday. In brief we expect
        tighter spreads into and through Q1 before aninflection point sometime around Q2. Overall we expect EUR non-fin.
        IG corporatebond spreads to end the year +25bp and HY +100bp. We expect total returnsacross the European credit
        spectrum to be negative (Euro HY -0.3%) althoughexcess returns should remain positive with IG outperforming HY
        on a risk-adjustedbasis.</p>
