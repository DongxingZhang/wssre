    <p> According to the MoF, hard currency bonds comprised 67.6% of the stock of debtheld by the central administration
        in Q2 2017 (ex-central Bank, provinces, andcorporates). Debt held by non-residents reached 37.4%, from 34.5% in
        Q1 2017.<br/><br/>
        In November, private ARS-denominated deposits expanded by 3.4% m/m in nominalterms outpacing USD-denominated
        deposit expansion once again. Credit expansionremains higher than the one of deposits.<br/><br/>
        International reserves showed an increase throughout November 2017, rising up toUSD 54.7bn. Meanwhile, USD
        reserve requirements climbed only by a smallerextent, leading to a rise in ¡¯net¡¯ international reserves to USD
        40.4bn.<br/><br/>
        The dynamics of foreign asset purchases remained unchanged: in October 2017, thenon-financial private sector
        bought USD 1.95bn, once again above the averagesince December 2015. With this, the 12-month cumulative USD
        purchase by thesector increased further to USD 28.3bn ¨C the highest in the series.<br/><br/>
        The fact that USD purchases by retail remained strong, indicates that anunderlying appetite for external assets
        was not curbed by higher ARS rates andlower USD deposit expansion. While this has been more than offset by
        portfolioinflows into the country, this dynamics should be watched closely.<br/><br/>
        The total amount of assets under management (AUM) for the mutual funds industryincreased to ARS 565.6bn (USD
        32.0bn) as of October 2017. This represents a 75%increase since the beginning of the year.</p>
