    <p> In November, we decided to switch our exposure from the long-end to the short-end of the TIIE curve (Mexico
        Strategy: Unchanged allocation, reduced duration).<br/><br/>
        Back at that point, we weighted the conditional scenarios for Mexican risk assets going forward and the call
        from our economists that Banxico would not hike rates this year. However, the rhetoric adopted by the recently
        nominated central bank governor, Alexandro D¨ªaz de Leon, and inflation surprising to the upside have put
        pressure in the front-end of the TIIE curve.<br/><br/>
        We took the opportunity to update our real rates model after today¡¯s inflation print. The latest results suggest
        that there is a substantial dislocation between the premium embedded into the UDIbonos yields.<br/><br/>
        Strategy: Our overall allocation remains the same, yet we recommend switching USD 10k DV01 out of the 18-month
        TIIE receiver at 7.69% and buy Jun19 UDIBonos at 3.36%; allocation: USD 10k DV01; Initial target: 3.06%; Stop
        loss: 3.60%; carry is positive in 12bp/month.</p>
