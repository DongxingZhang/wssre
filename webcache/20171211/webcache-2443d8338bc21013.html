    <p> In addition to MarFATM monthly for both Energy and Metals, a Factor monthly reporton Metals was introduced
        yesterday.<br/><br/>
        Now it is time for Factor Energy, a publication that updates factor model values forboth WTI and Brent and
        gasoline RBOB on a monthly basis.<br/><br/>
        Results suggest that Brent crude oil is ~10% above model¡¯s central value, yet notenough to trigger a formal
        short recommendation.<br/><br/>
        WTI is not abnormally expensive while gasoline RBOB is rich to model.<br/><br/>
        Strategy: Factor model is currently neutral on crude oil; MarFATM is short a basket ofBrent and WTI.<br/><br/>
        A stress study and model¡¯s performance were included at the end of the publication.</p>
