    <p> Hong Kong stocks retreated from 29,800 level on Monday after China¡¯s securities regulator reportedly suspended
        the approval of Hong Kong-focused mutual funds, which potentially slowed the pace of southbound money into Hong
        Kong stocks. Market sentiment was also weighed by losses in the mainland China markets which slid to their
        3-month lows. The benchmark index was further dragged by internet giant Tencent Holdings (#700) and
        Apple-supplier AAC Technologies (#2018), after a sell-off in US high-flying technology stocks, resulting in a
        fall for 5 trading days in a row. Over the week, the Hang Seng Index dropped 792 points or 2.65% to 29,074.24,
        while the HSCEI slumped 3.9% to 11,449.43. The average daily Mainboard turnover was little changed at HK$130.7
        billion, compared with HK$132.6 billion in the previous week.<br/><br/>
        In addition to AAC Tech and Tencent which slumped 9.7% and 7.4% w-o-w, the top year-to-date gainers such as Ping
        An (#2318) and AIA (#1299) also lost their steam, down by 9.9% and 7.5% w-o-w respectively. Those index
        heavyweights faced strong selling pressures as most of them had accumulated a lot of gains year-to-date, which
        triggered profit-taking actions by investors near the year end.<br/><br/>
        On the economic front, China and Hong Kong reported mixed set of macro data this week. China manufacturing PMI
        unexpectedly picked up at 51.8 in November, despite a crackdown on air pollution and a cooling property market
        that had been widely expected to weigh on the economy. In contrast, Hong Kong¡¯s retail sales in October rose
        3.9% y-o-y, falling short of market estimate of 4.9%. In addition, the export growth in Hong Kong slowed from
        9.4% in September to 6.7% in October, also missing consensus¡¯ 10.1%.<br/><br/>
        Looking forward, investors may eye on the release of trade balance in China and employment situation in the US
        next week. The Hang Seng Index is expected to further correct to below 29,000 level as Tencent investors is
        likely to keep taking profit before the year end.</p>
