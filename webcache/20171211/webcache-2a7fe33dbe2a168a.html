    <p> The United Lab (3933HK, Buy): Insulin pipeline gaining visibility<br/><br/>
        We believe TUL is well positioned to capitalize the 3rd generation insulin opportunity, given its strongpipeline
        to ensure long-term growth. We have assumed revenue based on a 2% share by 2020whichwill improve to 10% by 2025.
        Given ongoing pollution control in 4Q17, we expect the ASP in 2H17to average at around Rmb180/kg with improving
        EBIT margins despite rising input costs. We expectgrowth momentum to strengthen from FY18, as the API upcycle
        extends into 1H18and as thecompany ramps up its insulin Glargine with greater market coverage.<br/><br/>

        China Gas (384HK, Buy): 1HFY17/18net profit up 100%; gas sales and connections beat<br/><br/>
        Robust earnings growth in 1HFY17/18was mainly attributable to strong growth in natural gas salesvolume and the
        number of coal-to-gas substation users. The rural coal-to-gas substitution businesshas a large impact on the
        company¡¯s earnings. Meanwhile, the sales of natural gas for heatingsystems is giving a strong boost to overall
        gas sales volume. The company¡¯s gas sales price spreadis relatively stable. Given these factors, we estimate
        FY18-20EPS of HK$1.253, 1.593and 1.922,based on which the stock is trading at 20x, 15.7x and 13x P/E (Nov
        29close). Our target price ofHK$30represents 20% upside.</p>
