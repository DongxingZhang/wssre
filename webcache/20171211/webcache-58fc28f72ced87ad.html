    <p> Inflection point for PPP; SOE reform to accelerate; 3Q A-share earnings.<br/><br/>
        The government is increasingly concerned that PPP is becoming a disguisedborrowing vehicle to circumvent policy
        restrictions. Since May, the MOF hasannounced three major notices to strengthen PPP controls. The latest
        ¨CDocument 92 ¨C provides more concrete guidelines for removing unqualifiedprojects. Meanwhile, we believe SOE
        reform will accelerate further in 2018-19.<br/><br/>
        In our first report on the SOE reform-related investment theme, we focus onthe context, objectives, guidelines,
        progress, case studies and implications,with a basket of 20 stocks identified as likely beneficiaries. On 3Q

        Macro and earnings: 3Q macro data weaker; insurance/IT led earnings upgrade.<br/><br/>
        Macro data came in slightly weaker than expected for October: 1) NovemberNBS PMI rebounded slightly to 51.8 from
        the previous month¡¯s 51.6 andremained in the expansion zone. Caixin PMI dipped to 50.8 vs. prior 51.<br/><br/>

        HK equities¡¯ ADT averaged HKD117bn in Nov¡¯ MTD, higher than the previousmonth and still strong compared to the
        YTD average (HKD86bn). Connectinflows continued both ways while volatilities subsided. A-share sentiment
        wasstable. Onshore rates and credit spreads both expanded rapidly (10-yr treasuryyield exceeding 4%, likely due
        to continued financial deleveraging).<br/><br/>
        Risks Key downside risks: 1) tighter-than-expected monetary policy; 2) harsherthan-expected property tightening;
        3) any disorderly deleveraging as Chinatightens shadow credit; and 4) sharper-than-expected RMB depreciation.
