        Malaysia¡¯s October trade affirms robust exports and manufacturing activity into fourthquarter. This is further
        strengthened by Malaysia¡¯s Nikkei PMI Manufacturing index whichsoared to a 43-month high in November amid
        stronger underlying demand and risingcommodity prices. Despite rising raw material prices and input cost
        inflation, firms were ableto pass on the higher cost to consumers. The degree of business confidence over the
        next12 months was the strongest in nearly four years mainly due to stronger demand and newprojects. The
        expansion in new orders has led to more job hirings. We expect Malaysia¡¯sgrowth momentum to remain upbeat for
        the rest of the year.<br/><br/>
        USD/MYR hovers at 4.06 following strong gains in past week despite firmer dollar. Wesee the next key support
        level at 4.03. Ongoing positive factors including robust growth,possibility of two rate hikes in the next 12
        months, and firmer oil prices, should continue todriver further MYR strength into 2018.</p>
