    <p> Recall the October meeting reiterated the ECB¡¯s view that the forward guidance on policyrates (namely that they
        will be at current levels until ¡°well past the end of the net assetpurchases¡±) alongside the announced 9-month
        QE extension were crucial for steeringmarket expectations on rate hikes. We are not expecting any change in
        terms of forwardguidance at the December meeting. Specifically on rates, we see no increases beforemid-2019 at
        the earliest.<br/><br/>
        The minutes to the October ECB meeting revealed that some members wanted to announcean end-date to QE as they
        were concerned that an open-ended programme could leadto an unjustified expectation that there could be a
        further extension of purchases beyondSeptember 2018. Meanwhile, some members were worried that a specific
        end-date couldcause an undue tightening in monetary conditions. Draghi himself said 3 times that therewould be
        no ¡®sudden¡¯ end to QE, perhaps suggesting that a further extension or taper couldstill be in the pipeline. We
        think that the current QE extension will be the last, especiallyif Eurozone growth holds up and slack is
        absorbed; and inflation gradually movestowards target; not least because eligible Bunds will be getting
        scarce.<br/><br/>
        This also means that the message at the December meeting, as well as updated forecastscould provide us with a
        little more detail about the ECB¡¯s thinking. As far as the ECB¡¯sforecasts are concerned, the main news since the
        last meeting has been the sharp increasein oil prices. This is likely to see the ECB pushing its 2018 inflation
        forecast higherfrom the current 1.2%. Note that the ECB will also publish for the first time its
        inflationforecast for 2020. On growth, we think that there will be minimal changes. Whilst growthmomentum has
        been strong, the rise in oil prices is likely to weigh on consumers.</p>
