    <p> WTT Investment (issuer rating of B1/B+ from Moody¡¯s/Fitch) issued USD670million of 5NC3 notes at ytm of 5.5%
        with an order book of USD3.3 billion (perBloomberg). We like the rarity value being utility type HY exposure
        frommature market with positive FCF profile. That said, we do note PE ownershipand high leverage which offsets
        some of the above positives. WTT 2022 bondhas done well in the secondary, currently trading 1-1.5pts higher,
        amidstoverall Asia HY space being slightly softer since early Nov. We initiate on WTT2022s with Hold as we see
        limited further upside and discuss below ourrelative value thoughts.<br/><br/>
        Closest comparable for WTT is Dr Peng which has similar businessexposure in China. Dr Peng is a A-share listed
        company with bigger scale(~5x revenue and EBITDA), similar EBITDA margin, net cash position and isresultantly
        rated two notches higher (both issuer and bond rating byMoody¡¯s). On the other hand, Dr Peng is more vulnerable
        to competitivepressure than WTT and has inferior cash flow profile. Dr Peng has ashorted dated 2020s which is
        currently trading at ask ytm of 4.6%. Werelatively prefer WTT though adjusted for PE ownership and longer
        tenor,WTT 2022s looks fair at ask ytm of 5.1%.<br/><br/>
        Apart from Dr Peng, we can look at Indian IT companies too which alsohas a utility-type model with positive FCF
        profile. WTT benefits from morebenign competitive landscape in enterprise fixed-line telecom market in HKwith no
        major headline risks compared to anti-offshoring rhetoric forIndian IT companies. That said, Indian IT companies
        have lower leverage,higher credit rating and relatively better bond structure, in our view, whichis key for PE
        sponsored deals. Two notches (by Moody¡¯s) higher Marble II2022s is trading at ask ytm of 4.7% (ask ytw of 4.6%
        to Jun-21) while onenotch higher rated (by Moody¡¯s) HT Global 2022s is trading at ask ytm of5.1% (ask ytw of
        5.0% to Jul-19). We expect comparable WTT to tradelargely flat to Indian IT companies. At current levels, WTT
        2022s does lookfairly valued to slightly expensive though we must highlight WTT¡¯s rarityvalue (rare HK based
        defensive HY exposure).<br/><br/>
        Perhaps we can also look at HY rated fixed-line telecom companies fromother developed markets. Most of such
        companies despite being larger inscale generally have weaker market position given competition from
        largerplayers in their respective market. Looking at Zayo Group, one notch lowerrated (issuer rating by Moody¡¯s)
        with similar EBITDA margins (mid 40%)and leverage (~5.3x), which issued 2027 maturity bonds earlier this
        yearwhich is currently trading at ask ytw of 5.2% (ytw to Jan-25). Adjusted forscale, unlisted status and PE
        ownership WTT 2022s looks fair to us.</p>
