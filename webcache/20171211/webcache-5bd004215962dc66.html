    <p> China General Nuclear Power Corp - New issue thoughts, dated Dec 4<br/><br/>
        Existing guaranteed 2025s are at G+105bp, and typical 5/10 year spread curve is at 20-25bp for power names,
        though recent new issues have been steeper. We see eventual fair value for CGN¡¯s 2022s &amp; 2027s (A3/A-/A+) at
        85-90bp &amp; 115-120bp respectively (without new issue concession). Note that CGN also has a 2025 with a
        keepwell structure that trades around G+105bp. The IPG at 130bp area and 165bp area clearly looks quite generous
        to compensate for the heavy supply from China, even if we assume the usual tightening before final guidance..
