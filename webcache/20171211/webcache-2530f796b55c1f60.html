    <p> We saw the November rate rise as a ¡°dovish hike¡±, largely due to the absence of any guidanceover another
        near-term hike, but more importantly, the BoE¡¯s ditching of its line that marketsmay be under-estimating overall
        tightening. We believe the BoE¡¯s approach is very muchabout getting the first hike out of the way, then
        assessing market conditions beforeaddressing the timing of the next hike or before tackling QE unwind.<br/><br/>
        Since the last BoE meeting, economic data has come in on the slightly disappointingend, whilst progress on
        Brexit talks continues to falter. Despite higher oil prices, thelatest CPI inflation print was unchanged at 3.0%
        y/y ¨C 0.2ppts below the estimate the BoEhad penciled into its November forecasts. Retail sales for October
        contracted in y/y terms forthe first time since 2013. Consumer confidence has fallen further, and wage growth
        remainsweak. Please refer to the charts below.<br/><br/>
        It seems that the BoE is comfortable with two more quarter-point increases ¨Croughly oneby late next year and
        another in 2020 ¨C as it errs on the side of caution. At this juncture,we continue to expect the BoE to be on
        hold until at least May 2018, as it strikes abalance between inflation and growth, as well as amid ongoing
        Brexit uncertainties.</p>
