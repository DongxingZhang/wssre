    <p> First rate hike in 11 years could change perception on property as investment.<br/><br/>
        We believe 2018 could well be a turning point for the Hong Kong propertymarket on the back of anticipated
        changes in the funding environment (i.e. thefirst rate hike in 11 years) and supply/demand dynamics, which we
        believe maychange the perception of property as a good investment tool. Specifically, weexpect residential
        prices to decline 14% in 2018 on rate hikes, surging newsupply, and intensifying competition from mainland
        developers in projectlaunches. In the office market, we expect Central Grade-A rents to decline 5-10% on
        softening demand. In the retail market, we expect shopping mall rentsto fall 5-10% on unsustainable occupancy
        cost.<br/><br/>
        Residential market facing challenges with rising mortgage rates/completions.<br/><br/>
        While primary market volume is set to see a new 10-year high in 2017,secondary market volume is still sluggish.
        Primary volume now makes up 33%of the total (versus the long-term average of 20%), highlighting that thestrength
        in the primary market has been driven by developers¡¯ offers of vendorfinancing. Meanwhile, we believe the
        shortage in the residential market willreverse in 2018 as completions surge to 20,559 units (88% above the
        10-yearaverage) but take-up remains at 10,828. We see the attractiveness ofresidential properties as a good
        investment tool fading in such an environment.<br/><br/>
        Our analysis shows that rental yield and the capital appreciation of primaryprojects sold in the past six years
        have markedly underperformed the market.<br/><br/>
        Office: demand softening with MNCs leaving and continuing decentralization.<br/><br/>
        While Central Grade-A office rents have stayed firm, vacancy rates have risento the highest level in 2.5 years
        on a negative net take-up. We see weakness indemand corresponding with the departure of MNCs on the back of high
        rents.<br/><br/>
        Companies that originate from the US, UK, Japan and Australia have continuedto relocate their regional
        headquarters away from Hong Kong, so that Chinesecompanies are now the only meaningful demand driver. However,
        as theaverage space requirement of Chinese firms is markedly smaller than theirMNC counterparts, we believe the
        overall take-up will likely stay weak.<br/><br/>
        Consequently, we expect Central Grade-A office rents to soften 5-10% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Retail: too early to call for a solid recovery; occupancy cost unsustainable.<br/><br/>
        On the back of stabilizing visitor arrivals, particularly Chinese visitors, HongKong retail sales
        correspondingly stabilized. However, with absolute retailsales hovering within a tight range of HK$34-37bn per
        month in the past year,we believe it is too early to call for a solid recovery. On the other hand, weanticipate
        retail rents to be under pressure ahead due to historically highoccupancy costs. In particular, as turnover has
        generally fallen to low singledigits, turnover rent serving as a variable rent buffer is diminishing, and
        anyfurther decline in high-street shop rental is likely to start putting downwardpressure on shopping mall
        rents, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Lack of fundamental catalysts but we do not rule out a technical catch-up rally.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentally speaking, we see few near-term positive catalysts in Hong Kongproperty. However, given that
        absolute valuation is not stretched and the sectoris a sizeable constituent in the Hang Seng Index, in view of
        its underperformanceYTD, we do not rule out a technical catch-up rally in the coming months. Risks:unexpected
        changes in government policy and the economy.</p>
