    <p> Investment Strategy: Winners and losers of the US tax bill<br/><br/>
        In Hong Kong and China, we believe the US tax bill will have a positive impact on export-orientedcompanies,
        transportation firms, companies with meaningful income from the US, and producers ofcommodities such as aluminum
        and copper, given increasing US demand. On the other hand, wehave seen sector rotation in the US with investors
        snapping up financials and consumer names,which should benefit more from the tax bill, and selling of tech
        stocks, which should benefit less andhave higher valuations. This will likely put pressure on TMT stocks in Hong
        Kong. We believe theHong Kong market outlook remains promising.<br/><br/>
        Investment Strategy: Market likely to remain weak before the year-end, but fundamentalsremain strong<br/><br/>
        Although yesterday¡¯s market decline was sharper than expected, there is still downside risk as theimminent US
        tax reform approval and the surge in the HK HIBOR rate will have a negative impacton the HK market. If the
        market correction is due to political and geopolitical risk, it is likely to betemporary in nature, and given
        the better fundamentals now than during previous corrections, wewould expect a smaller market correction of up
        to 10% from the peak (but a bigger correction for topperformers), and would consider this an opportunity to buy
        at lower levels.<br/><br/>
        Geely Auto (175HK, Buy): Nov monthly sales hit new sales high<br/><br/>
        Geely¡¯s sales rose 37.9% YoY and 12.9% MoM during Nov, hitting another record high on peakseason strength and
        higher demand for the company¡¯s SUV models. SUV sales were up 95.7% YoYand 14.3% MoM, and accounted for 49% of
        total sales during 11M17, a proportion that has risencontinually this year. The company¡¯s sedan segment also
        maintained steady growth. 2018will be akey year for the company, with five new launches under the Geely brand
        and contribution from Lynk&amp; Co. We think the company¡¯s sales will remain strong in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Pharmaceutical: First BE test products approved by the CFDA, positive for CSPC Pharma<br/><br/>
        Sino Biopharma announced yesterday its registration approval of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate fortreatment of
        HBV, the first generic drug to complete bioequivalence studies. We see this as positivefor leading domestic
        companies such as CSPC Pharma as the government has been advancingbioequivalence studies for domestic generics.
        CSPC Pharma has three generics pending approvalin the near term. The company¡¯s stock was down yesterday without
        any change in growth infundamentals. We continue to expect the sector to outperform in early 2018, and favor
        largepharmas, TCM names and CRO players.<br/><br/>
        Construction Machinery: Nov excavator sales volume beats expectations; maintain Buy onLonking<br/><br/>
        Excavator unit sales rose 107.4% YoY during Nov, exceeding expectations and also up on Oct.11M17sales were up
        99.2% YoY. We expect the sales recovery to continue in 2018, mainly drivenby FAI and the replacement cycle.
        Although Lonking has not announced its Nov sales volume yet,we believe its sales growth will continue to
        outperform peers. We believe the strong Nov excavatorsales volume should help to ease market concerns that led
        to its recent weak stock performance.We maintain our Buy rating and TP of HK$4.30.</p>
