    <p> We maintain our bullish view on the AI universe (link, Jun 7) andsurveillance solutions. Hikvision attended our
        IMT conference in Beijingon Nov 21. Investors are particularly interested in: 1) the GM outlook; 2)
        AIfeaturedsurveillance and edge computing; 3) robots; and 4) the outlook foroverseas business. We expect the new
        AI-featured product cycle to transformsurveillance from passive observation to active prediction, driving a
        re-rating.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Long-term GM target unchanged at 40%: Management maintains theirconsistent guidance of revenue growth at 20%+
        YoY in coming years andlong-term gross margin target at 40%. The company will continue to invest inR&amp;D; to
        support long-term revenue growth.<br/><br/>
        AI-featured surveillance; empowered edge computing: Upgradingsurveillance camera specifications to include AI is
        more than an upgrade inresolution/image capture, like the shift from analog to digital. Rather it isempowering
        cameras with computing ability, lowering the computing burdenon central servers and reducing the amount of data
        to be transmitted.Hikvision believes ¡°Edge computing + Cloud¡± will be mainstream in the future,especially in the
        surveillance sector, given that the video consumes largedatastreams and thus will rely more on edge devices to
        structure data beforesending it to central servers.<br/><br/>
        AI-featured surveillance in transportation; structures data beforetransmission to central servers: AI-featured
        cameras could do basic dataanalysis. For example: 1) separate those images with cars passing by fromthose
        without, and only transmit those with cars to central servers; and 2) notonly capture images but also label the
        cars¡¯ features, such as colour, type,brand, size, car plate, etc, supporting image search using these
        labels.<br/><br/>
        Robots; dual-engine driven: Management maintains guidance for revenuefrom innovative businesses (home
        surveillance, robots, automotiveelectronics, SSD, infrared sensors) to at least double in 2017. The
        robotsbusiness is seeing strong growth driven by increasing automated productionin China and growing use of
        unmanned warehouses in e-commerce.<br/><br/>
        Overseas business outlook: Management maintains the view that there aregreater uncertainties in overseas
        businesses compared to domestic/China,given relations among countries. Hikvision continues to expand their
        overseasmarket, especially in Southeast Asia, and upgrade their services from productsales (distributors¡¯
        channel) to total solutions, which have higher GM.<br/><br/>
