        3Q17 revenue and non-GAAP net profit (incl accretion) beat consensus by6% and 3%, respectively, driven by strong
        transaction business revenuegrowth and accelerating media business growth. Yixin raised Rmb5.5bnthrough a HK IPO
        at a US$6.3bn valuation. We lower our TP from US$50 toUS$47 and switch to SOTP valuation. This values 1) the
        advertising andsubscription business at US$6/share or a 10x FY18E PE, 2) the digitalmarketing solutions business
        at US$1/share or a 10x FY18E PE, and3) Yixin group at US$31/share or a 35x FY18E PE.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        3Q17 results beat and 4Q17 guidance in line. 3Q17 revenue grew 54% yoyto Rmb2.3bn, exceeding the high-end
        guidance of Rmb2.2 bn and 6%/2%higher than consensus/MQ estimate. GAAP operating margin was skeweddue to the
        share-based compensation in Yixin, while non-GAAP operatingmargin was stable at 11%. 4Q17 revenue guidance of
        Rmb2.40-2.45bn is inline with consensus estimates of Rmb2.42bn and implies 42-46% yoy growth.<br/><br/>
        Yixin to triple earnings in 2018. Transaction volume reached 380k(incl. 300k from Yixin) in 9M17 and is well on
        track to its half million target for2017. We estimate the total number of transactions will reach 521k in
        2017and 811k in 2018. Yixin¡¯s self-operated loan balance reached Rmb20bn in1H17. We estimate transaction
        services revenue will increase 61% yoy toRmb6bn in 2017, contributing 53% of total revenue. Margin expansion
        issupported by the increasing contribution from the high-margin transactionplatform business. We see 200% yoy
        growth in Yixin¡¯s earnings in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Accelerating growth in advertising and subscription business.<br/><br/>
        The advertising &amp; subscription business grew 19% yoy in 3Q17, acceleratingfrom 4%/13% yoy in 1Q/2Q, driven
        by the increase rev from value-addedservices and achieving an increase in both ARPU and the number of OEMand
        dealer customers. After adding 2k subscribers to a total 24k subscribersin 3Q and achieving a very high
        penetration rate, the company¡¯s advertisingbusiness should be more driven by price hikes going forward. The
        companywill focus on leveraging AI and big data to enhance the efficiency andaccuracy of the connection between
        dealers and car buyers to eventuallydrive up ARPU. We expect its core media business to continue
        deliveringdouble digit growth in 4Q17 and 2018.<br/><br/>
        Switch to SOTP valuation as Yixin went public. We value BITA¡¯s traditionalmedia and digital marketing solutions
        based on 10x FY18E PE and the Yixingroup on 35x 2018E PE for its faster revenue and profit growth and apply a20%
