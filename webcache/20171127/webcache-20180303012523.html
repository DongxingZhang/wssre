    <p> Summary<br/><br/>
        Core CPI inflation surprised modestly to the upside in October, rising 0.225%in month-on-month terms. This
        raised the year-over-year rate to 1.8%. The dataprovide additional evidence that the core inflation trend is
        firming after a stringof very weak prints earlier this year. The three-month annualized change in coreCPI
        inflation is now at 2.4%, the strongest since February 2017. Today's datawill not resolve the inflation debate
        among Fed officials, nor will it persuade Feddoves. But the data should help to alleviate the inflation worries
        of some centristand hawkish-leaning Fed officials who had grown uneasy with the Fed's inflationnormalization
        narrative earlier this year.<br/><br/>
        Within the details, there is tentative evidence that core goods inflation isstarting to firm, after meaningfully
        underperforming both our models based onmacroeconomic fundamentals (e.g., the dollar, PPI core goods prices,
        importprices) and leading indicators at the component level (e.g., PPI apparel prices andprivate sector measures
        of used car prices). However, the year-over-year inflationrate for core goods inflation still remains near the
        lowest level since 2004andwell below leading indicators. Core services inflation, on the other hand, wassomewhat
        stronger than expected, and the outperformance was broad-basedacross the subcomponents. The report also appeared
        to be free of distortionsfrom meaningful outliers, other than the jump in tobacco prices.<br/><br/>
        Looking ahead, our core inflation forecast has increased modestly in the neartermbut is otherwise broadly
        unchanged. Core CPI inflation is still expected toremain near recent low levels in year-over-year terms through
        2017. But we expectthe monthly inflation rate to show a somewhat firmer trend of about 0.18% onaverage over the
        coming months. A continuation of this trend is supportive of aDecember rate hike and a gradual pace of rate
        increases in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Beyond, today's data give us somewhat more confidence in our view that coreinflation should rise over the medium
        term. We have been generally conservativein our forecasts for a number of components, particularly on the core
        goodsside, relative to leading indicators. But there is now tentative evidence that somecomponents are either
        rising toward leading indicators (e.g., used cars) or areremaining resilient in line with macro fundamentals
        (e.g., owners' equivalentrent). We continue to see core inflation approaching the Fed's objective byend-2018.
