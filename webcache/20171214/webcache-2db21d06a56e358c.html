    <p> We believe BYD Electronic International¡¯s recent share price drop is mainly due to weaker demandfrom domestic
        smartphone manufacturers in 4Q17. As a result, we revise down our EPS forecastsfrom Rmb1.24 to Rmb1.15 in 17E
        (+109% YoY), from Rmb1.54 to Rmb1.39 in 18E (+21% YoY), andfrom Rmb1.70 to Rmb1.60 in 19E (+15% YoY). We also
        lower our target price from HK$27.00 toHK$21.00, representing 13x 18E PE. We remain positive on the company¡¯s
        long-term growthprospects and, with 25% upside, maintain our BUY recommendation.<br/><br/>
        Casing driver. The company¡¯s metal casing business remains its primary earnings driver as the firmreceived more
        orders from Android-based smartphones in 4Q17. However, according to the Ministryof Industry and Information
        Technology (MIIT), monthly shipments continued to decline YoY in 4Q17,which we believe is primary due to weaker
        demand from the domestic market. We cut our 17E casingrevenue forecast from Rmb14bn to Rmb13bn to reflect
        lower-than-expected domestic demand.<br/><br/>
        Nevertheless, we maintain our casing revenue forecast of Rmb14bn in 18E as we are confident BYDElectronic will
        receive more orders from Oppo and Xiaomi in coming years. Due to fierce competitionamong casing suppliers, as an
        increasing number of them are expanding their computer numericalcontrol (CNC) capacity, we slightly lower our
        casing gross margin forecast from 30% to 28% in 18Eand 19E.<br/><br/>
        Order expectations. We still recommend BYD Electronic as we expect the company to receive more3D glass orders
        from both domestic and global leading smartphone original equipmentmanufacturers (OEMs) from 2018 on. At
        present, both Samsung Electronic (005930:KS) and Huaweihave adopted 3D glass design on the Note 8 and Mate 10
        smartphones, respectively. We expect threeother domestic smartphone vendors, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, to adopt
        the 3D glass design in 2018 aswell. The company currently provides 3D glass casings to LG Electronics
        (066570:KS). We expect it toreceive more domestic glass orders from 1Q18 on. Over the last two months, the
        company¡¯s 3D glassyield rate continued to improve, but still weighed on its gross margin. We forecast 20% gross
        marginfor its glass casing segment, considering heavy early-stage depreciation and amortisation (D&amp;A;)
        costs.<br/><br/>
        We note BYD Electronic has the capability to provide a wide range of metal, glass, and ceramicdesigns, giving
        the firm a clear competitive advantage as most competitors are only able to provideone or two designs.<br/><br/>
        Maintain BUY. We revise down our EPS forecasts from Rmb1.24 to Rmb1.15 in 17E (+109% YoY), fromRmb1.54 to
        Rmb1.39 in 18E (+21% YoY), and from Rmb1.70 to Rmb1.60 in 19E (+15% YoY). We alsolower our target price from
        HK$27.00 to HK$21.00, representing 13x 18E PE. With 25% upside, wemaintain our BUY recommendation.</p>
