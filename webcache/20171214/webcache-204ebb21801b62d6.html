    <p> The automation reform and diversification strategy are bearing fruits.<br/><br/>
        In her speech, Ms. Dong commented that Gree began to diversifyits businesses in recent years. In addition
        air-conditioning business, ithas entered into the field of small appliances, smart manufacturing,smart phones
        etc. Gree is undergoing automation reform. The companyconsidered using the domestic equipment before, but it
        finally chose theimported German devices due to the higher precision. But as a long termplan, Gree decided to
        enter into the field of industrial manufacturing in2013. Currently, Gree¡¯s CNC machine, and robots are not only
        providedfor internal use, but also for other industries. Ms. Dong said that all ofthe devices in Zhuhai Silver
        Dargon (a company invested by Ms Dongprivately) were produced by Gree.<br/><br/>
        Preview of 2017 results. According to Ms. Dong, Gree ¡®s 2017-ytdrevenue increased RMB 40bn (2016 revenue:
        RMB108.3bn) as comparedwith last year¡¯s same period, and its NP margin was 15%.<br/><br/>
        With 2017 sales increased by RMB40bn, this implies 2017 total gross revenuewill reach RMB148bn, which beat DB's
        forecast and market consensus by 5%and 4%, respectively. As for NP margin, her guidance is 0.3/0.8 ppt higher
        thanDB's forecast (14.7%) and market consensus (14.2%), respectively. Managementdid not comment on Ms Dong's
        2017 sales and NPM data.<br/><br/>
        Better product mix: an important positive in 2018 restocking that is not fullypriced in. Gree¡¯s strong net
        margin could be driven by better product mix.<br/><br/>
        In our recent channel checks we noticed that distributors (starting from thenew air conditioner year) are
        focusing more on improving their product mixthan in previous years, clearing inventory to recover cash. This may
        drive betterprofitability for air conditioner brands (on top of strong volume growth which islikely in the
        price). Profitability expansion should be universal, as Midea previouslyindicated that its core brand gross
        margin has improved by 2-3ppt YoY during 3Q17 analyst meeting. In our model, we expect GPM for 4Q17F to reach
        32.3%for Gree vs 3Q17's 30.9% and 4Q16's 29.4%.</p>
