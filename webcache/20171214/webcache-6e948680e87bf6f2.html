    <p> We prefer quality names with robust pipelines, and mispriced opportunities<br/><br/>
        Our top picks include Sino Biopharm, Jointown and Universal Medical, while wetake Hengrui off the top list due
        to valuation. We believe quality manufacturerswith a strong pipeline should continue to outperform, while SBP
        has multiplepositive catalysts on key pipeline drugs that have not been properly reflected in thestock. We also
        believe there are still mispriced opportunities, such as Jointown.While consensus has penalized the entire
        distribution sector, we see Jointownemerging as a winner from the zero-sum game of two invoices.<br/><br/>
        Multiple positive catalysts ahead<br/><br/>
        We expect NRDL impact on P&amp;L; starting 1Q18, and accelerated regulatoryapprovals as key catalysts for
        large-cap stocks. We highlight that SBP, CSPC and3SBio have 12, 6, and 3drugs that were included in the new
        NRDL, representingabout 19%, 26%, and 56% of YTD3Q17revenue, respectively. We also expect3-4blockbuster
        approvals for SBP and Hengrui respectively, and 2-3key drugapprovals from CSPC in 2018. Additionally, we believe
        the ongoing two-invoicereform will create a nadir during 3Q17to 2Q18, while an inflection point is highlylikely
        in 2H18. We believe it would be a good time to re-examine opportunitieswithin the distribution segment in the
        next few quarters.<br/><br/>
        Expect improving regulatory framework and rebound of approvals<br/><br/>
        Regulatory data indicated a rapidly rising number of innovative drug approvalsYTD17, along with much shorter
        review times. 35innovative drugs (class 1.1) havebeen approved YTD17, vs. 6, 6, 3in 2016, 2015and 2014. We have
        observed muchshorter review periods where few high-profile drugs were approved within 2-3months of filing, a new
        record for the CFDA. We highlight there was one domesticclass 1.1drug approval and only a few FTM generics in
        2017, likely leading to arebound of regulatory approvals in 2018. Notably, of the 142applications fromdomestic
        players that are under priority review for production, Hengrui, SBP andCSPC own 10, 8and 4compounds
        respectively.<br/><br/>
        Expect valuation gap to widen for large cap names; valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Heading into 2018, we anticipate trading multiples on large-cap names are likelyto differentiate as investors
        dig deeper on key valuation variables such as POSand peak sales. Current sector valuation appears to be slightly
        high, as the MSCIChina HC Index is trading at 18.9x FTM EPS, above its three-year average of 17.7x.Key risks
        include price erosion, reimbursement reform and regulatory delays.</p>
