    <p> Hazardous waste treatment market update from industry player<br/><br/>
        We recently met with management of Sunny Friend (8341TT, not rated), a leaderin hazardous waste treatment (HWT)
        in Taiwan. In addition to its projects inTaiwan, the company runs a HWT plant in Beijing and has project
        pipelines inHebei, Jiangsu and Shanxi. The company provides HWT EPC service and technicalservices to companies
        in China. Key takeaways from our meeting include: 1) HWTmarket is already quite balanced in certain cities; 2) M&amp;A;
        is not an ideal wayto expand in HWT and 3) cement kilns are unlikely to pose a strong threat totraditional
        incineration.<br/><br/>
        Dongjiang Environmental (895HK), China Everbright Greentech (1257HK) andChina Everbright Intl (257HK) all have
        direct exposures to HWT, while BeijingEnterprises Water (371HK) has exposure through one of its associates.
        ChinaEverbright Intl is our sector top pick and we like the stock on 1) earningspotentially beating consensus on
        fast project ramp-ups; 2) re-rating from higherproportion of earnings from operations and 3) free cashflow
        improvement with itsWTE business. For more details, please refer to China Environmental - Strongerenforcement,
