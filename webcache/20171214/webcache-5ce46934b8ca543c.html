    <p> Katja Filzek: Hold to Buy, tgt EUR107 to EUR180. Last Close EUR142.85.<br/><br/>
        Looking beyond polysilicon at some attractive specialty chemical assets. Weincrease our recommendation for
        Wacker Chemie to Buy and TP tof ?180. Weexpect Wacker¡¯s chemical specialty business to develop into a 23%+
        EBITDAmarginbusiness and polysilicon to be managed for high cash returns. This shouldlead to 22% net profit
        growth (CAGR 2017-20E) and FCF yields at the upperend of peers. Wacker is already debt free, when taking its
        30.8% Siltronic stakeinto account and therefore offers &gt;4% dividend yield potential. Valuation
        appearsattractive at 6.6x EV/EBITDA 2018, which is 27% below peers.</p>
