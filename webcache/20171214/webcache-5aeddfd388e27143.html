        The deal implies Tencent¡¯s plans to further explore both online and offline retailmarkets, apart from the
        partnership with Jingdong; despite that the details of thepartnership are yet to be formed.<br/><br/>
        Yonghui¡¯s Super Species and Yonghui Life can also leverage Tencent¡¯s large onlinecustomer base to extend their
        online and O2O presence. Please refer to our reportSun Art and Yonghui - A new wave of partner-seeking in a new

        Capital Toady owns 12%, Chairman Mr Zhang Xuanning owns 12%and co-founder Mr Peng Huasheng owns 24% of Yonghui
        Yunchuang . After theinvestment, we believe Yonghui Yunchuang will potentially become an associateof Yonghui
