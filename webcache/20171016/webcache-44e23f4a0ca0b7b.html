    <p> Potential tax changes would appear to benefit Steels most.<br/><br/>
        While early days, Trump's proposed tax reforms would tend to benefit capitalintensiveindustries due to potential
        expensing of capex, with companiespaying high effective rates and largely domestic operations, benefitting most.<br/><br/>
        Within our M&amp;M; coverage, steel companies are most favorably positioned dueto the majority of their
        operations located within the US, followed byAluminum &amp; Specialty Metals companies. With most Precious
        companies,within our coverage, operating outside the US (primarily Canada, SouthAmerica and Africa), they would
        be less impacted, followed by IndustrialMetals producers, who have the highest proportion of non-US
        operations.<br/><br/>
        Steel mini-mills and Service Centers to be the largest beneficiary.<br/><br/>
        Steel sub-sector Pre-tax Profit is expected at $5.5bn in 2018E to be taxed at aweighted tax rate of ~30%. With
        93% exposure to US-based operations,lowering corporate tax rate to 20% would imply a $682m net income
        benefit.<br/><br/>
        Applying a 15x Price-Earnings multiple would translate to ~$10bn incrementalequity value or +25% vs current
        sector market capitalization of ~$41bn. SteelDynamics/Nucor are likely largest beneficiaries (2018E EPS upside
        of 23%),followed by Reliance/Ryerson (21% each) and Commercial Metals (15%, lowerdue to International ops).
        Integrated steelmakers (US Steel/AK Steel) lessimpacted as they do currently pay no Federal tax due to
        significant NetOperating Loss (NOL) carry-forwards, but expensing of capex a LT positive.<br/><br/>
        Aluminum &amp; Specialty Metals.<br/><br/>
        2018E subsector Pre-tax Profit is $3.4bn @ ~34% tax rate. With 56% exposureto US operations, a cut to 20% rate
        implies a $240m. At 15x PE = ~$3.6bnincremental value or +12% vs current market cap of $30bn. Alcoa, Arconic
        andCarpenter Technology likely largest beneficiaries (2018E EPS upside of 15%),followed by Constellium at only
        7% due to majority of operations ex-US.<br/><br/>
        Allegheny, Century and Kaiser NOL¡¯s limit near-term benefits.<br/><br/>
        Precious Metals.<br/><br/>
        Pre-Tax Profit 2018E at $4.3bn and ~32% tax rate. Precious Metals subsectorcould see EPS upside of 7% over the
        next two years at 20% tax rate. USexposure for Gold producers ~38%/34%, in 2018/19E (based on
        geographicalrevenue breakdown). Barrick has largest US presence at 45% (2018E EPSupside of 15%), while Goldcorp
        least-exposed, operating mainly in Canada andSouth America. Silver companies ~24% US-exposed, with Pan American
        andWheaton having none. EPS impact ~8% for Silvers.<br/><br/>
        Industrial Metals.<br/><br/>
        Within Industrial Metals, only Freeport-McMoRan and Teck have direct USoperations and we estimate overall EPS
        benefit of lower US tax rate at only~3%. Despite ~22% of Freeport¡¯s 2018 pre-tax profit US-based, company
        has~$10bn of NOLs limiting near-term benefit of rate cut. For Teck, we calculate15% of pre-tax profit is
        US-derived via Red Dog and Pend Oreille mines.<br/><br/>
        Valuation wrap.<br/><br/>
        On average, our Price Targets are based on ~7.3x 2018E EV/EBITDA fordownstream companies or ~1.0x NPV for
        upstream miners. Risks includemetal price movements, raw material costs, end-market demand,
        operationaluncertainty, FX and M&amp;A.; This report does not change forecasts, ratings or PTs.</p>
