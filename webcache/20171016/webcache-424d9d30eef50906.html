    <p> Commentary for Friday: Our forecast of a 50k gain for September nonfarmpayrolls (NFP) assumes a substantial
        impact from the recent hurricanes. For ahistorical comparison, the initial print in September 2005 after
        Hurricane Katrinawas -35k, well below the previous three-month trailing average of around 175kat the time. Note
        also that the effects were persistent, with job growth takinguntil November 2005 to fully recover. However,
        there is considerable uncertaintyaround this expectation. Case in point, the September ADP employment
        surveyshowed a gain of +135k, which was about 70k below the three-month trailingaverage of 206k in
        August.<br/><br/>
        Additionally, jobless claims during the September employment survey week wereup 12% from August. Regressing the
        change in initially-reported NFP on thechange in jobless claims during survey periods points to an NFP headline
        print ofaround 125k. Thus, our forecast may very well be too conservative.<br/><br/>
        Given the potential weather-related distortions to the September employmentreport, we updated our NFP models to
        better gauge the underlying trend injob growth. Our private NFP models are based on ADP and the
        employmentsubcomponents of the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing indexes. Whilethe aforementioned ADP data
        may indicate some negative hurricane effects ¨Cthe 135k print was the lowest initial print since October 2013 ¨C
        the SeptemberISM employment subcomponents have sent an undeniably upbeat message.<br/><br/>
        Manufacturing ISM employment is the highest since mid-2011 and the compositeISM employment reading was the
        highest since May and the third highest in thecurrent business cycle.<br/><br/>
        One version of this model explains the two-month moving average of privatenon-farm payroll growth with the
        composite ISM employment reading. Basedonly on the elevated level of ISM employment, the model would point to a
        solid~260k two-month moving average of private NFP growth. The full model, which incorporates the weaker signal
        from ADP in addition to the strong ISMs, wouldstill point to a sturdy ~200k print.<br/><br/>
        Additionally, we would not be surprised if the moderate August payrolls print issubsequently revised higher. In
        fact, since 2010 August payrolls have been revisedup by +55k on average between the initial and third prints ¨C
        the second highestmonth for revisions over this period. Thus, there are ample reasons to believe thatthe
        underlying labor market picture remains solid, suggesting that a weak NFPprint on Friday should be appropriately
        discounted.<br/><br/>
        Within the other details of the report, we expect the unemployment rate to remainsteady at 4.4% even if job
        growth slows, though the Katrina experience suggeststhat there could be a negative impact on unemployment as
        well. In the monthsahead of Hurricane Katrina, the unemployment rate had declined steadily. Butthe unemployment
        rate rose by one-tenth in September 2005 and remained atthat level through November, at which point its
        downtrend resumed. Indeed, the¡°weather workers¡± series within the Household survey should provide a senseof the
        magnitude of the weather impact on the September report.<br/><br/>
        We expect a solid month for wage growth (+0.3% m/m), helped by positive¡°week-day¡± effects, since there is a
        tendency for average hourly earnings (AHEs)growth to be stronger when the 15th of the month is within the survey
        week.<br/><br/>
        Also, AHEs have historically been a bit stronger when there is a five-week gapbetween survey periods. If
        realized, this would keep the year-over-year growthrate of average hourly earnings stable at 2.5% for the sixth
        consecutive month.<br/><br/>
        However, there is some risk that the year-over-year growth rate rounds up a tenthto 2.6%, which would be
        positive for aggregate income growth. In summary,the risks for market participants are somewhat asymmetric in
        that a weak NFPprint should be rightfully discounted due to weather-related disruptions whilea more robust
        employment gain would add to policymakers¡¯ confidence thatthe growth outlook remains very much positive.
