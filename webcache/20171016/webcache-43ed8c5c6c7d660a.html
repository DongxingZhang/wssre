    <p> Predictable enough: China¡¯s PPI pops and, presto, headlines appear warning aboutinflation making a come-back ¨C
        not just in China, mind you, but regionally. Well,think again. The country¡¯s PPI is no longer well correlated
        with local consumerinflation, and has actually never really been that close to CPIs elsewhere in Asia.<br/><br/>
        What drives China¡¯s PPI are things that feed into construction: mostly coal, ironore, copper¡­and we¡¯d throw
        nickel in as well. The CPI, by contrast, is primarilyabout food. Sure, that may have changed a bit in the last
        several months or so,with the former going sideways while the latter plunged. But that can be explainedby other,
        one-off factors, like higher energy costs and the price of some services.<br/><br/>
        And what¡¯s true for China mostly applies to the rest of emerging Asia as well: foodand energy rule when it comes
        to CPIs. Iron ore and other such hard stuff justisn¡¯t terribly relevant for Asia¡¯s inflation outlook. So, keep
        China¡¯s PPI bouncein perspective: it may be good for profits in some (upstream) sectors but in itselfit doesn¡¯t
        signal that price pressures are building more broadly ¨C whether in Chinaor elsewhere in the region. For CPIs to
        take off, we need food or energy to move,and jointly for a real kick, but that isn¡¯t happening. At least not
        yet.</p>
