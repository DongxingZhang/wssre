    <p> VIP significantly outgrew mass, again。<br/><br/>
        This summer was hot - Macau's GGR grew 6.5% qoq (22% yoy). But VIP wasmuch hotter than mass as small junkets
        aggressively expanded (&gt;20junketrooms opened in 3Q). We thus expect DICJ to report next week that, in 3Q,
        VIPGGR was +35% yoy while Mass GGR only +6% yoy. The mix-shift has a -ve impacton margin, though partially
        offset by operating leverage. As such, we expect 3Qindustry property EBITDA +7% qoq (+18% yoy). We expect Cotai
        companies tohave gained market share while Peninsula peers, namely MGM China and SJM,to suffer more from the
        typhoon. In our report last Tues (Golden Week kicks off, 3Oct 17), we highlighted that the sector may take a
        breather after Golden Week.If stocks pull back after weak 3Q results, we would Buy MGM China (Buy) andWynn Macau
        (Buy) on dips as next year's FCF improvements and dividend hikesshould support a re-rating on a 12-month
        view.。<br/><br/>
        3Q preview: MGM China likely the worst in town。<br/><br/>
        We expect Galaxy (+12% qoq) and Wynn Macau (+10% qoq) to deliver thestrongest sequential EBITDA growth given
        their VIP strengths. Galaxy and SandsChina (+7% qoq) are both beneficiaries of the summer holiday season in
        Cotai.But we expect Galaxy to benefit more because of the new VIP room opened byDavid junket, the
        fastest-growing junket operator this year. For SJM, we expectluck-adj EBITDA +5% qoq (headline EBITDA +12% qoq)
        assuming start-up lossat Jai Alai casino narrows. MGM China is likely the only operator with sequentialEBITDA
        decline (-3% qoq) due to bad luck and typhoons.。</p>
