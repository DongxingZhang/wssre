    <p> Equity raising announcement.<br/><br/>
        Lenovo has announced a HKD3.9 billion equity raise (at HKD4.31 per share)through non-preemptive share issuance
        to Legend Holdings and Mr. Yang(CEO and Chairman), subject to approval from other shareholders andwhitewash
        waiver to avoid making a general offer. Separately, 3 year bonuswarrants will be issued to the same
        counterparties, which when exercised willraise another HKD468 million (at HKD5.17 per share). Both these
        transactionswill increase the stake of promoter group from 38.01% to 43.11%. Use ofproceeds has been stated as
        future acquisition opportunities and generalcorporate purposes. Interestingly, the announcement mentions that
        debtissuance was also considered, but it would have increased the finance costand higher transaction fees would
        have to be incurred.<br/><br/>
        Comes as a positive surprise, but....<br/><br/>
        We were not expecting this, especially given recent headlines that Legend islooking to grow in new-age sectors.
        Plus, equity is down more than 10% YTD(as of Friday close). The share issuance will increase proforma cash
        balance asat June 30 from USD1.5 billion to ~USD2 billion, demonstrates thecommitment of key shareholders and
        puts to rest the privatization debate(Bloomberg) for now. Note that Lenovo has historically kept a high
        cashbalance, with recent range being USD2-3 billion. And with just USD264 millionremaining in the capital
        structure as bank loans (other than bonds), we don'tforesee cash being used for debt repayment, which should
        keep the grossleverage high (4x at June 30). Anyways, as stated by the company itself, theprimary purpose could
        be an acquisition. As we all know, Lenovo has a historyof making large acquisitions every few years. To be
        clear, we don't expect anacquisition of the same magnitude as IBM's PC or server businesses orMotorola Mobility,
        each of which cost in the range of around USD2-3 billion.<br/><br/>
        More recently, press reports (including Reuters) in end 2016 had indicatedLenovo's interest in Fujitsu's PC
        operations. The company is also planninginvestment of USD1.2 billion in artificial intelligence over 4-5 years.
        Net net,though this news has taken us by surprise, we won't be over excited till use ofproceeds is clear as it
        is unlikely to be used for immediate deleveraging.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Sell on the 2022s (G+195bp bid as of Friday close) and Hold on theperps (102.2 bid).<br/><br/>
        Our regular readers will know that the negative view on straight bonds hasbeen driven by concerns around
        underlying businesses (PC's structuralchallenges and Mobile's losses) and valuations. The former hasn't abated
        yet,albeit we acknowledge valuations don't look as stretched now. The 2022s haveunderperformed, widening about
        15bp since issuance in March. In themeantime, overall IG markets in Asia are tighter. However, compared to
        otherunrated bonds from China like Chalco 2022s (G+180bp) and China Chengtong(175bp), the Lenovo bonds still
        don't look cheap ¨C we believe they should keeptrading wider than these. Even looking at higher BB rated HK names
        likeLifestyle 2022s (G+210bp), Lenovo appears expensive.</p>
