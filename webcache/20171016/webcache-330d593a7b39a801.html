    <p> We believe Cosmax's sales grew 21% y-y in 3Q to KRW225.2b but its operatingprofit fell 6% y-y to KRW11.1b¡ªboth
        figures are in line with our original forecasts,while sales should meet the consensus but operating profit
        should fall 6% short.We see no new factors that alter Cosmax¡¯s fundamentals and do not expect resultsto
        significantly impact the shares, which are trading at just 24x 2018P/E.¡£<br/><br/>
        We maintain our forecasts and our target price at KRW140,000(based on 26.5x2018P/E, the global cosmetics maker
        average). Our target offers 14% upside, andwe maintain BUY. We see no reason for Cosmax to trade at a discount
        to its peers,given its ability to sustain double-digit sales growth in trying business conditions.We advise
        monitoring steps being taken to turn around the loss-making USsubsidiary, which we feel holds the key to
        Cosmax¡¯s enterprise value.</p>
