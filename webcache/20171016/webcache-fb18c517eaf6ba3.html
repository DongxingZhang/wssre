        Handan steelmakers in China¡¯s Hebei province have been ordered to reduceutilization rates to 45-50% from Oct 1to
        Mar 31. This is in line with the centralgovernment¡¯s pollution control directive, but begins one month earlier
        than therequested timeline (Nov 15-Mar 15). Out of the total 14mills (30furnaces), 4will operate at 45% due to
        their proximity to urban centers, whereas theremaining 10will operate at 50%. 19of 30will be offline till Mar
        31, whereasremaining furnaces would gradually resume operations. Platts estimates totaloutput loss at 8.5mt (~1%
        of China¡¯s 2017annualized output). (SBB)¡£<br/><br/>
        Australia¡¯s Liberal Party plans to block a proposed increase in gold royaltyrates in Parliament, citing
        projected job losses. The Labor Government hadrecently proposed a royalty hike from 2.5to 3.75% for gold price
        above$933/oz, a move that was expected to put ~3k jobs at risk. Facing oppositionfrom several parties, the hike
        will likely be blocked due to a majority vote afterintense lobbying by the Western Australian gold sector.

        bill.Uncertainty over votes from a few other Senators means the administrationwill need support from Democrats
        for the bill to pass. A few other Senatorshave already expressed criticism and concern over the Tax
