    <p> Merkel re-elected for her fourth term as German Chancellor, as broadly expected, but the party vote for her
        CDU/CSU union fell to 33%, significantly lower than the 41.5% in 2013, and the lowest since 1949.<br/><br/>
        The second largest party, Social Democrats (SPD, center-left), which is the current junior coalition with
        Merkel, also suffered from a post-war low in supporting rate, at 20.5%. Together, the share of the grand
        coalition, i.e., CDU/CSU and SPD, significantly declined from over 90% in 1970s to the current 53.5%, reflecting
        the growing political divisions of the country.<br/><br/>
        With the two mainstream parties¡¯ fall in votes, the far-right nationalist party, Alternative for Germany (AfD),
        gained significant boost, by winning 12.6% of the votes and entering the bundestag as the third last party
        (occupied 94 seats). In our view, the discontent fueled by Merkel¡¯s ¡°open-door¡± refugee policy, which hastened
        the arrival of more than 1.1 million refugees into EU in 2015 and caused serious security problems (known as the
        refugee crisis), explains the surge of AfD.<br/><br/>
        Merkel¡¯s success, at least to some extent, is helped by Germany¡¯s steady economic growth. By enjoying a host of
        advantages, such as her predecessor Schroder¡¯s labor market reform, the cheap euro and borrowing cost for much
        of her chancellorship and the still working baby-boomer generation, unemployment has been falling since she took
        office in 2005, economic growth kept outperforming most of other Eurozone countries.<br/><br/>
        However, against the solid economic performance, the falling supporting rate signaled voters disillusionment
        towards some hidden drawbacks: the rising concern of social inequality, the decline of old industries and the
        underdevelopment of new industry (such as the internet of things and electric cars), and also the falling
        government infrastructure investment due to the austerity policy.<br/><br/>
        Looking forward, as the SPD previously pledged to go into opposition, in our view, Merkel¡¯s most likely
        coalition option would be a three-way ¡°Jamaica Coalition¡± with the Greens (with 8.9% of the votes) and the Free
        Democrats (FDP, with 10.7% of the votes), a liberal pro-business party returning to parliament after losing all
        its seats in 2013. But negotiations to get both parties at the cabinet would be somewhat difficult, as the FDP¡¯s
        liberal and pro-business economics contrasts with the Greens¡¯ environmental interventionism.<br/><br/>
        If as we expected, the Jamaica Coalition could be achieved, we expect to see a more pro-business government than
        the current ¡°Grand Coalition¡±, which could generate reform momentum. But for the Eurozone integration, proposed
        by the French President Macron, the Jamaica coalition could be much more cautious, as the FDP is explicitly
        against Macron¡¯s ideas on a separate Eurozone budget with a new finance ministry and setting up a European
        Monetary Fund.<br/><br/>
        Finally, for market reaction, as the election result is basically in line with broad expectations, market impact
        should be limited. Although euro fell some 40 basis points on the surge of AfD, it recovered in a short while.
        European stock market reactions have also been positive.</p>
