        We downgrade energy from overweight to benchmark: we upgraded the sectorto overweight at the end of May (see our
        sector allocation, May 2017), onexpectations of a rebound in the oil price on the back of USD weakness. Over
        thepast three months, the sector has outperformed by 6%, driven by a 18% rise in oil,making it one of the best
        performing European sectors over the period. However,the sector¡¯s price relative now fully reflects the current
        level of the oil price,which in turn has already risen to the level implied by the USD. Our commoditystrategist
        expects oil to stay roughly at current levels by year-end, at 55$/bbl. Asa consequence, we downgrade energy from
        overweight to benchmark.<br/><br/>
