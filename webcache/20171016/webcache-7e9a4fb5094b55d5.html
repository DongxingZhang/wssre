    <p> The 7% YTD rally of the RMBagainstthe USD has plaguedChina¡¯stextile OEM sector, on fearsof forex translation
        loss and rising cost pressure that will weighon their margins.<br/><br/>
        We believesuch negative impact might havebeen overplayed by the market, as the RMB rallyagainst the greenbackis
        widely expectedtobe unsustainable. Moreover, RMB is more stable versus the currency basket, as the CFETS RMB
        Index is still down by 4% YTD YoY due to the euro strength. This has supported China¡¯s strong 7.4% YoY growth in
        export value in Jan-Aug 2017. Thus, we believe the demand growth in the textile sector would more than offset
        the negative impact of translation loss this year.<br/><br/>
        Previous concerns such as rising raw material costs and Trump¡¯s punitive tariffson China exportsto the U.S.
        arefaltering, as the cotton price growth pace has continuedto decelerate, whereas the rebound in synthetic yarn
        prices has beenprimarily driven by higher crude oil prices. Moreover, athleisure continues to evolverather than
        subside, thus sportswear is expected to continue to drive growth of the global apparel and footwear industryat a
        5-yr CAGR of 6.7% over 2016-21E, versus 4.9% for apparel &amp; footwear industry. Sectoralvaluation remains
        attractive asdividend yield is high at an average of 4.7%, only second to the REITS sector.<br/><br/>
        Demand growth more than offset the potential negative FX impact. We believethe RMB rally against the greenback
        is primarily driven by theChina government¡¯s capital controls and the dollar weakness, where both are
        unsustainable. Moreover, RMB is more stable versus the currency basket, as the CFETS RMB Index is still down by
        4% YTD YoY due to the euro strength(see Figure 2). This has supported China¡¯s strong7.4% YoY growth in export
        value in Jan-Aug 2017, compared with a 7.6% YoY decline in 2016 when the RMB depreciated (see Figure 3). Thus,
        we believe the growth in demand of the textile sector would more than offset the negative impact of translation
        loss this year and such losses will not expectedto continue through 2018.<br/><br/>
        Assessment of potential impact on individual companies. Our analysis (see Figure 4)showed that the negative
        earnings impact would be greatest on Shenzhou International (2313 HK, BUY), followed by Pacific Textiles (1382
        HK, BUY) andNameson (1982 HK, BUY). As we expect RMB appreciation against the USD to be short-lived, we
        recommend investors to accumulate quality names on consolidation leveragingon the fablingRMB rally.</p>
