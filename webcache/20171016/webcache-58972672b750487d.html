        FOMC meeting, focus will be on any signsof a shift in the Fed¡¯s views about the expected policy rate path as
        representedby the ¡°dots.¡± While the recent string of soft inflation prints argues for somedowngrade to the dots,

        Financial conditions have eased considerably in recent months. After bouncingaround near zero just prior to the
        US election ¨C a level indicating that financialconditions were broadly neutral for growth ¨C our high-frequency
        financialconditions index (FCI) rose to its highest (i.e., most growth-supportive) level inseveral years in
        August (Figure 1). Our FCI has declined slightly over the pastmonth but continues to indicate that financial
        conditions are loose, signaling solidgrowth in the coming quarters.¡£</p>
