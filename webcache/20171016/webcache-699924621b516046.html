    <p> The recent pause by the SARB has raised concerns that the inflation cycle may beturning a lot sooner than
        expected. Sure there are several short-term risks whichmay cloud the inflation outlook, and possibly also
        provide some stickiness to theinflation profile. But in this note, we take a look as to why inflation
        momentumcan still surprise lower at least in the near term and inflation pressures remainabsent well into 2019 -
        baring external shocks. A weak growth recovery may onlyerode inflation slack at a gradual pace.<br/><br/>
        Our inflation forecasts remain below consensus and the SARB's projections. Weexpect headline inflation of 4.4%
        and 5.1% in 2018 and 2019 vs SARB at 5% and5.3% (Figures 6-9). We thus still see scope for further rate cuts
        early next year,but for this to happen, the SARB may need to be surprised to the downside.<br/><br/>
        On the labour side, we emphasise our thinking around the importanceof unit labour cost compression, which is
        still well underway (Figures1-4). In the face of high unemployment, weak productivity and asubdued employment
        outlook, wage growth moderation is expected tocontinue (see Figures 11-14). On a relative trade-weighted ULC
        basis,the directional implication for the exchange rate remains a positive one(Figure 5).<br/><br/>
        Demand side pressures remain broadly absent. Household demand andconsumer confidence point to below-trend
        inflation for the next yearand a half. A negative credit impulse and expectations of below normalcredit growth
        further strengthens this trend. Historically, no inflation upcycle has coincided with negative consumer
        confidence (see Figures16-18).<br/><br/>
        Supply capabilities are weak if one considers the low potential growthrate projected by the SARB. Similarly,
        capacity utilisation rates shouldn'tbecome a problem anytime soon. Excess inventories, reduced supplierbacklogs
        and pressure on new orders will keep purchasing commitmentslow in the near term. Over the medium term a subdued
        outlook for private sector investment implies a very low risk of cost-push inflationrisk (see Figures 19-22).
