    <p> The PBoC announced a targeted RRR cut for some banks. The cut will becomeeffective from 2018. We do not take
        this as a shift of monetary policy stance.Instead it is a step to offset the tightening effect from macro
        prudential regulation.We believe the monetary policy stance will stay neutral in Q4, with money marketrates
        broadly unchanged from their Q3levels. We expect growth to slow onlymoderately and gradually in Q4. The monetary
        policy stance will likely loosen inH12018when economic growth faces more serious downward pressure.</p>
