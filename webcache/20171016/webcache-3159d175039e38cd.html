    <p> Turn to our first heatmap. Things in advanced markets look pretty punchy (sorry, except for theUK). ISM,
        Germany¡¯s PMI¡­and France now, too! Meanwhile, Japan notched up another gain. Inemerging Asia, however, things
        are more mixed. China¡¯s NBS index drove the headlines, but notethe dip in Caixin¡¯s. The former is more geared to
        larger firms, the latter to smaller ones. Small andmedium-sized enterprises are still struggling; it¡¯s the
        bigger ones, often state-owned, that are doingbetter (no wonder the PBoC just introduced a targeted RRR cut for
        SME lending). Malaysiadragged down ASEAN. Taiwan, Asia¡¯s star performer over the past year, pulled back a
        touch,though Korea moved above the waterline.<br/><br/>
        The puzzling divergence, in short, between DMs and EM Asia, continues (Chart 1).<br/><br/>
        The pace of new order expansion in emerging Asia was unchanged on the month (at 52.5, not bad,but not
        accelerating). Our new order-to-inventory ratio, however, sends a more bullish signal: itjumped last month,
        spurred in large part by continued strength in China, and a bounce in India.<br/><br/>
        That suggests that output growth should pick up in the coming months (chart 2).<br/><br/>
        Our second heatmap sends a more sobering message. New exports orders cooled for the most part.<br/><br/>
        An exception is the US (presumably helped by a weak dollar). This, and Japan, helped liftdeveloped market new
        export orders. But in emerging Asia these ticked down again. Anotherpuzzling divergence (chart 3). We suspect
        shipments from the region will cool into year-end (takea look, in case you missed it, at the latest Asia
        Economics Quarterly: Takin¡¯ it down a notch, 29September, 2017).<br/><br/>
        Another DM-EM divergence is notable in our heatmap: employment. The West is sizzling in termsof job creation
        (sorry UK). And so is Japan. But elsewhere in emerging Asia, things are a lotsoggier. Not a recipe for surging
        consumer spending.<br/><br/>
        Quick note on input and output prices. Our last chart shows that these surged further last month.<br/><br/>
        We suspect that¡¯s mostly because of the rise in construction-related commodity prices (China), andenergy costs.
        We still don¡¯t see any of this pushing up core CPIs. Central banks should see throughthis. At least until growth
        turns up more convincingly.</p>
