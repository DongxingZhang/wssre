    <p> Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) has held its second auction of windprojects: The new auction-based
        tariff for wind-based power is INR2.64/unit,representing a decline of 24% compared with the tariff at the first
        auction, held inFebruary 2017. This is 33-56% lower than tariffs paid under the previous Feed-in-Tariff (FIT)
        based regime. Interestingly, it is only c10% higher than tariffs set by SECIauction for solar-based projects and
        at par with the recent solar tariff.¡£<br/><br/>
        Implications: We believe the 24% reduction in the tariff in just seven months reflectsimproved clarity on the
        availability of the transmission infrastructure required forenergy offtake and lowered return expectations from
        developers given the paucity ofinvestable opportunities due to the absence of a state Feed-in-tariff pipeline
        andslower solar auctions. While this will put incremental pressure on the profitability ofequipment
        manufacturers, we had already anticipated this and factored it into ourforecasts. We estimate a c300bps EBITDA
        margin reduction as the industrytransitions from FIT-based procurement to an auction-based regime. The
        significantlyreduced differential between solar and wind tariffs should alleviate investor concernson the
        viability of wind-based power projects vs solar.¡£<br/><br/>
        Investment view: As highlighted in our recent report, India wind ¨C looking past thepainful transition, 21August
        2017, we expect FY18will be a painful transition yearwith very low commissioning of power projects. With tariffs
        becoming so competitiveand incremental demand from non-windy states through SECI auctions, we believethe market
        will start to expand from FY19e onwards. Suzlon and Inox shares havecorrected by 24% and 43%, respectively,
        since May 2017on the back of a weak 1Qand the painful transition from FIT to auctions. We see this as a buying
        opportunity asthe market is set to expand and the wind industry has become significantly moreprice competitive.
        We retain Buy ratings on both Suzlon and Inox Wind.¡£</p>
