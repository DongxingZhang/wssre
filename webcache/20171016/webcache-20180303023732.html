    <p> New business formats have become a new driver for food retailers¡£<br/><br/>
        SSSg momentum in 3Q was in line with that in 1H17for major food retailers,based on our channel checks.
        Better-than-expected 1H17results gave us moreconfidence in GPM expansion and operating leverage for efficient
        players. Newretail formats, including O2O and ¡°dining + supermarket¡±, could be newgrowth drivers. For Sun Art,
        B2B and O2O contribute both SSSg and OP.Yonghui¡¯s supply chain advantage should continue to secure core
        competencyin the fresh food area. Its partnership organization could deliver betteroperating leverage, in our
        view. We thus reiterate Buy on Sun Art and Yonghui,with a new target price of RMB8.9for the latter.¡£<br/><br/>
        Sun Art ¨C B2B and O2O drive SSSg and profitability¡£<br/><br/>
        We believe that Sun Art could record a slight SSS decline in 3Q, with a flat tomarginal SSSg decline in July/Aug
        and a higher rate of decline in Sept, due toa shift in the mid-autumn festival to Oct. SSS would have trended
        better thanin 2Q, thanks to its O2O and B2B businesses, launched in 2016and 2017,respectively. O2O and B2B also
        play key roles in its ecommerce sales growthand loss reduction. It expects online GMV to double this year,
        driven largely byB2B. For 3Q17, we expect an 11% rise in NP on a 7% rise in sales.¡£<br/><br/>
        There are some investor concerns over Sun Art¡¯s business model, which isbased on rental income from its
        galleries (shopping malls) offsetting its biggestcost item, i.e. rental expense. With traffic declining, such a
        model would notlikely hold up with rental income falling short of rental expense. However,based on commentary
        from an industry veteran, we believe Sun Art may havetransitioned rental expense from being a fixed cost to a
        variable cost (nowaccounting for 70% of the total vs 50% previously). This would have created amechanism where
        rental expense would decline with rental income decline.The company has also been upgrading its galleries with
        better brands and isadding more catering. Additionally, its supermarkets are installing automaticcheck-out
        facilities to ease labor cost pressure. We continue to regard Sun Artas one of the most efficient players in the
        industry and maintain our Buyrecommendation.¡£<br/><br/>
        Yonghui ¨C supply chain competency and partnership program to bring operating leverage¡£<br/><br/>
        For 3Q17, we expect a 57% rise in EBIT on a 21% rise in sales. We expect alow single-digit rise in SSS. We
        expect Yonghui¡¯s GPM expansion (0.2-0.3pptimprovement each year over 2017-2019) to be sustainable, thanks mainly
        to 1)an advantage in the fresh food supply chain over most of the internationalplayers and 2) a better overall
        GPM with the increase in contribution fromhigher-GPM Bravo YH. Its supply chain advantage also helps to secure
        bettervalue-for-money products for its new retail formats, e.g. Super Species, whichis already profitable. We
        lower NP by 6% for 2017to reflect a higher opex ratiowith more store openings this year and raise NP by 2%/12%
        for 2018/2019.Our new target price is RMB8.9(previously RMB8.2). Maintaining Buy.¡£<br/><br/>
        Valuations and risks¡£<br/><br/>
        Our primary valuation methodology is DCF, which we believe is able to capturethe cash flow of China¡¯s retailers
        and distributors. We also use P/E multiplesfor back-testing. Downside risks: 1) weak same-store-sales growth; 2)
        slowerthan-expected expansion plans; 3) rising opex; and 4) fierce competition.¡£</p>
