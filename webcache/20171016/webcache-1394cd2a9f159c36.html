    <p> Energy drink: the energetic driver for soft drinks over the next three years.<br/><br/>
        We expect the energy drinks sector to grow by 16% over the next three years,driven by growing consumer demand
        and increasing penetration by the mainplayers. In our view, Dali Foods, which has a 9% market share, is the
        bestproxy to invest in the rising trends. China Foods should also benefit through itscooperation with global
        lead brand Monster Beverage. We raise Dali's targetprice by 13% to HK$6.5, reiterating Buy. We maintain Buy on
        China Foods.<br/><br/>
        Increasing demand on changing consumer lifestyles.<br/><br/>
        The China energy drink segment¡¯s retail sales achieved a 16% CAGR in 2014-16, outperforming the soft drink
        sector¡¯s 6% sales CAGR, according toEuromonitor. We think the main reason is changing consumer lifestyles
        ¨Clonger working hours coupled with increasing sports activates in leisure time.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, the rising penetration of major brands, such as Red Bull and Dali¡¯sHi-tiger, is also driving market
        growth. We forecast the market will grow by16% in 2017-19, driven by increasing demand and growing
        penetration.<br/><br/>
        Easing competition due to Red Bull¡¯s recent struggles.<br/><br/>
        Red Bull is the leading player in China with an 80% value share in 2016. RedBull¡¯s China franchising contract
        will expire in 2017 and is now in the processof being renegotiated, according to Xinhuanet.com. We expect the
        process toease competition in the energy drinks market, leading to more growthopportunities for other key
        players, such as Dali Foods and Shenzhen EastrocBeverage, which are the No.2 and No.3 brands by sales in
        China.<br/><br/>
        Dali Foods: well positioned in energy drinks; raising our target price to HK$6.5.<br/><br/>
        Among the listed F&amp;B; names in HK/China, Dali Foods has the highest exposureto energy drinks with 16% of
        sales from its energy drink brand Hi-tiger in1H17. Hi-tiger¡¯s sales grew by 43% yoy in 1H17, helped by fast
        industrygrowth and easing competition. We raise our earnings forecasts by 2-6% in2018-19 to factor in a higher
        earnings contribution from energy drinks. We arealso raising our target price to HK$6.5 based on DCF methodology
        (factoring ina 9.5% WACC and 2% terminal growth) and reiterate Buy. Downside risks:failure of soybean milk
        launch; higher-than-expected raw material costs.<br/><br/>
        China Foods: potential to monetize its contract with Monster Beverage.<br/><br/>
        China Foods has been the bottler and distributor of Monster Beverage (theglobal leading energy drink brand) in
        China since 2016. We expect Monster¡¯ssales contribution to China Foods to be limited in the near term, given
        thatmanagement is still focusing on internal restructuring. However, in the longterm, China Foods should be able
        to scale up its sales in the segment, helpedby Monster¡¯s successful branding experiences in the USA and China
        Foods¡¯sstrong distribution network. We reiterate Buy on China Foods and maintain ourtarget price at HK$4.5 based
        on SOTP. Downside risks include slower-thanexpectedasset restructuring.</p>
