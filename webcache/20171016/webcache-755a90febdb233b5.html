    <p> The September FOMC meeting, which marked the historic end of the QE program and maintained Fed¡¯s rate hike
        forecasts for 2017 and 2018, together with the latterly announced tax reform framework both lifted the odds for
        the December rate hike from below 60% to near 80%. This week, there are two important releases to watch: the
        September FOMC meeting minutes and the September CPI inflation. We expect the minutes to remain somewhat
        hawkish, reflecting Fed¡¯s confidence in economic growth and inflation development, expressed during the meeting
        and in recent speeches as well; while the September CPI may continue to be boosted by the hurricane effects.
        Thus, in our view, both of the releases could further confirm the increasing case of a December rate
        hike.<br/><br/>
        The US inflation has been subdued for most of this year, but we expect that the hurricanes could temporarily
        boost inflation in the near term. To be specific, the supply-side shocks brought by hurricanes has already
        caused rise in food, petroleum, and used car prices, as well as insurance premium. Regarding food prices, the
        hurricanes destroyed orange plants in Florida and wiped out agricultural production in Puerto Rico, which could
        lift up food prices in coming months. Regarding gasoline price, pipelines from Texas are disrupted, refineries
        are closed; the reduction in supply already caused a surge of gasoline price in August, and we expect such
        impact to continue into the near future. Meanwhile, the Brent crude oil price kept rising during September; and
        the recent Russia- Saudi Arabia reaffirmation of the OPEC supply cut should support oil prices in the
        future.<br/><br/>
        Moreover, the recent announcement of the framework of Republican tax reform reignited the market¡¯s speculation
        of future economic stimulus, which led to the rise of the market measures of inflation expectations. The
        reflation trade (started strong after the Trump election, but mostly faded this year) seems to rebound a bit.
        But we still remain cautious, as the current proposals are still a long way from being signed into
        law.<br/><br/>
        However, on the other hand, the hurricane effect has also brought damages to consumption and jobs. The August
        retail sales, existing and new home sales all fell, due to the hurricane effects. More important, both of the
        Fed¡¯s closely watched indicators were also affected. Unlike the CPI data, the August PCE inflation remained
        sluggish, with the core measure was only 1.3% YoY, the weakest since November 2015. Also, the September non-farm
        payroll dropped by 33,000, the first negative reading since October 2010. Of course, such impacts should be
        temporary one-off drags, but the dampened consumption and jobs could still pose downward pressures on consumer
        prices in the coming months. Thus, looking forward, we expect the ¡°post-hurricane price surges¡± to continue in
        September, but maintain our previous view that the US inflation can hardly reach the levels seen in
        1Q.<br/><br/>
        Finally for the Fed, as we have continuously reiterated, inflation has become the more important indicator for
        policy decisions in the future, as the US job market is already near or at full employment. Thus, the
        hurricane-led dramatic fall in non-farm payroll will not raise much concern of the Fed. However, the wage growth
        in the September employment report should be the main focus of the Fed, suggesting that the wage push inflation
        could finally been restored, which should give policy makers a stronger case to stick to the current rate hike
        schedule. The odds for December rate hike stand high at around 90%. But we still remain somewhat cautious: any
        notable deterioration of incoming economic data (especially the payroll and PCE inflation data), other than
        temporary shocks from the hurricanes, could still derail the December rate hike schedule.<br/><br/>
        In sum, we expect that the hurricane effect should continue to boost CPI inflation in the near term; and the Fed
        would keep the hawkish tone, due to the notable wage rise in September, and give themselves maximum flexibility
        for upcoming meetings. But for the longer-term inflation development, economic growth especially consumption
        growth is a more persistent factor. Thus, any of incoming consumption-related data still deserve close
        monitoring.</p>
