    <p> Steady inflation with deceleration in food prices¡­: September CPIinflation remained steady at 3.28%YoY (same as
        August), against anexpectation of an acceleration (Bloomberg consensus at 3.5%). The surprisewas led by a
        lower-than-expected rise in food prices and also a muted rise incore inflation compared to the last 2-month
        trend. We see the inflation data asmarking the near-term peak in the current uptrend. Indeed, high frequencyfood
        prices for October indicate a moderation, which coupled with the recentreduction in fuel prices (led by a
        reduction in tax rates) should lead to a lowerinflation print for October (our estimate at approx..
        2.8-3%).<br/><br/>
        ¡­ increases probability of a rate cut in Dec policy review, in line withour expectation: We believe that the
        balance of risk tilts in favour of a 25bprate cut in the Dec policy review given that inflation will likely
        hover at a lowerlevel in 2HFY18 closer to 3-3.75% compared to RBI¡¯s expectations of 4.2-4.6%. As we have
        highlighted before, keeping real rates at the upper end ofthe 1.25-2% band amidst a weak growth outlook may not
        be warranted. Wedo not envisage any meaningful price pressures emerging, given the benigntrend in the drivers of
        inflation ¨C excess capacity in the system, benign globalcommodity prices, proactive food supply management and
        prudent fiscalmanagement. Indeed, while we are building in another rate cut in FY18,consensus expectations are
        for a status quo, and in this context expectationsof a further easing could keep equity markets supported in the
        near term.</p>
