    <p> Technical conditions for the EM credit markets remain supportive on the back of strong funds flows and likely
        lighter positioning (as indicated by mutual fund beta), cushioning the impact of a surge in supplies. Solid
        spread performance of EM sovereign credit this month despite higher UST yields and many issuances attests to the
        strong appetite for EM bonds and supportive technical conditions. EM sovereigns sold USD26bn in September,
        bringing YTD issuance to USD138bn, close to of 2016 total volume (USD144bn). We expect around USD36bn more
        issuances in the rema0inder of the year, with Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, UAE etc. among some
        of the major sovereigns expected to come to the market.</p>
