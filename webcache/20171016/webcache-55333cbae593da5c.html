        Fitch raises Vale¡¯s credit rating to stable from negative. Not constrained byBrazil¡¯s country ceiling rating of
        BB+, Vale¡¯s LT foreign currency default ratingwas changed to BBB+ from BBB as EBITDA from Canadian operations
        ($1bn in2016) covers interest expense by more than 1x. Company¡¯s focus on costcuttinginitiatives and ramp up of
        higher grade volumes has led to increasedprofitability in an improved, yet unsustainable pricing environment.
        Assumingiron ore price of $70/t in 2017 and lower in 2018, Fitch expects Vale¡¯sND/EBITDA to decline to 1.3x by
        YE17 and reach its ND target of $15bn by2018. (Fitch).<br/><br/>
