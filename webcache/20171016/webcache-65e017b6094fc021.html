    <p> August retail sales not bad Aug retail sales rose 2.7% due to a low base, despitemainland visitor arrivals
        falling 2%. The figure was slightly below consensus of +3.5% andJuly¡¯s +4%. However, we do not think retail
        sales momentum slowed in Aug because 1)there was a mini rush to buy gold in July; 2) there were two typhoons in
        Aug, and; 3) foodsales dropped 3.9% in Aug due to the shift of the Mid-Autumn Festival from mid-Sept in2016 to
        early Oct in 2017. Excluding jewelry and pastry sales, retail sales would be up2.4% in Aug, similar to the 2.5%
        rise in July.<br/><br/>
        Jewelry retailers¡¯ quarterly SSSG may surprise HK jewelry retail sales climbed 10%YoY during July-Aug, 9.6pp
        above the +0.4% YoY growth in 2Q17. We believe growthmay moderate in Sept, compared to +7.3% YoY in Aug, due to
        the strong gold price inthe first half of Sept. If Sept HK jewelry retail sales come in flat, 3Q17 HK jewelry
        retailsales would still be up 7% YoY between July and Sept, equivalent to 6.6pp above 2Q17.<br/><br/>
        Currently, we assume 2QFY18 (July to Sept 17) HK &amp; Macau SSSG for Luk Fook (590HK, Accumulate) and Chow Tai
        Fook (1929 HK, Hold) will be just 2-3pp higher than in1QFY18. Our FY18 revenue estimates for both companies are
        in line with consensus.<br/><br/>
        Both CTF and LF will release 2QFY18 SSS figures this month.<br/><br/>
        Retailers optimistic about Oct sales Mainland tourist arrivals were up 8% YoY duringthe first two days of the
        National Day Golden Week. According to HKRMA, most retailersforecast 4-5% sales growth in Oct. If realized, this
        growth rate would be the highest so farin 2017. Given that positive growth in mainland tourist arrivals is
        underpinned by renminbiappreciation and the wealth effect from stock and property markets, we expect HK
        retailsales growth to remain positive in 4Q17. However, declining purchasing power amongmainland tourists will
        remain a challenge. We expect an earnings recovery for retailersthat have good growth in China/overseas markets
        and a stabilizing HK business. Wemaintain our Buy rating on I.T (999 HK), Accumulate rating for Luk Fook, and
        Hold ratingsfor Chow Tai Fook (1929 HK) and Chow Sang Sang (116 HK).</p>
