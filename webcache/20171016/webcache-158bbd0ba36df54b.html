    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +1.3%. Weekly loadings up 1.3%.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 1.3% in Week #40 (ended 09/30/2017)
        vs. a 4.6% decrease the prior week. Loadings YTD are up 0.3%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total
        US chemical shipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trend of broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measure of weekly loadings increased 1.3% YoY (versus a 1.6%
        increase in the prior week) and increased 3.2% sequentially (vs. a 0.7% increase in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices down 0.5 c/gal to 27 c/gal. Propane up 0.3 c/gal to 94 c/gal.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices were down 0.5 c/gal last week to 26.9 c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20 c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose, ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has
        declined following the September ¡¯16 start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethane export facility in Houston.
        Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/d fundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand
        from the start-up of 8 greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens, we expect ethane to
        trade toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuel value, with the premium reflecting fractionation,
        transportation and storage costs. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17 US Natural Gas price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, we estimate
        ethane prices will move toward 30 c/gal by year-end ¡®17.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices rose 0.3 c/gal last week to 94.3 c/gal. While propane inventories were down 1% last week to 78MM
        bbls, they are 17% and 9% below their 3 and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventories
        to decline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16 vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene down 1.7 c/lb to 29 c/lb. Margins down 0.2 c/lb to 12.4 c/lb.<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 1.7 c/lb last week to 29.0 c/lb (vs the September contract price of 35.25 c/lb, and
        August contract prices of 31.25 c/lb). Spot deals for October ranged from 28.5 to 29.5 c/lb with deals for
        November delivery ranged between 28.5-29.5 c/lb. Average spot ethylene margins compressed 0.2 c/lb last week to
        12.4 c/lb as lower selling prices more than offset lower production costs.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals for October delivery ranged between
        48-48.5 c/lb. September propylene contract prices settled up 7 c/lb at 46.5 c/lb for PG and 45.0 c/lb for
        chemical grade on the back of Hurricane Harvery supply disruptions. Propylene prices, which had risen 21 c/lb,
        or 68% (for PG), from December to March, fell 14 c/lb, or 27%, in April/May due to improving refinery-based
        supply. Prices rose 0.5 c/lb in July and August.<br/><br/>
        10% of US ethylene capacity remains offline due to Hurricane Harvey .<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, approximately 10% of US ethylene capacity remains offline as a result of Hurricane Harvey. IHS Nova
        Chemical¡¯s Sarnia, Ont cracker (2% of North American {NA} ethylene capacity), Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#1) cracker (1.6%
        of NA ethylene capacity), Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NA ethylene capacity) and Shell¡¯s Deer Park, TX
        cracker (3% of NA ethlylene capacity) will be offline in September for planned turnaround work. For ¡¯17, IHS
        forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 5.2B lbs, or 6.3%, of capacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%,
        of capacity in ¡¯16 and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.</p>
