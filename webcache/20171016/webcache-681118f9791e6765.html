    <p> Extension of covenant waiver from RCF lenders.<br/><br/>
        The existing waiver should be expiring soon, around mid-October. Withperformance unlikely to improve in the near
        term, further waivers might berequired. We expect RCF lenders to play ball and the company to announce
        anextension soon. We do acknowledge that the composition of lenders has likelychanged with more hedge funds
        getting involved, however don't see anyincentive for any lender to make the situation more difficult for
        Noble.<br/><br/>
        Separately, this also means that the RCF holders are perhaps still pushing toget secured, though we assume the
        management is sticking to its earlierstance of not giving any preferential treatment to any group of
        unsecuredcreditors.<br/><br/>
        Results to be announced in early / mid November.<br/><br/>
        While no one expects underlying operations to improve, the key focus will bedegree of cash burn. An unchanged or
        only slightly lower cash balance couldsurprise investors positively. We do foresee free cash to decline from
        theUSD635 million at June 30, given USD80 million in just coupon paymentssince then. However, the decline
        shouldn't be material in our view as workingcapital could have been released with shrinking businesses. If true,
        this releasemight also have been used to repay some of the BBFs, which could come inlower than the USD1 billion
        odd number last reported. Note that in the lastquarter, Noble's operating cash flow was negative ~USD500
        million.<br/><br/>
        Sale of US oil business.<br/><br/>
        Company expects to complete this by end Dec as we know. Assumingregulatory approvals take the same time as the
        gas and power sale (i.e. justover 2 months), announcement on the oil sale could be made by end October /early
        November. Another key factor will be surplus proceeds realized fromthese two asset sales after paying off the
        BBFs. We were a bit disappointedwith the final sale number for gas and power coming lower than
        initialexpectation (USD185 million vs USD248 million), albeit this was mainly to dowith M2M positions and
        working capital adjustments. With Bloombergrecently reporting that bids for the oil entity are "slightly" under
        USD1 billion,we don't expect surplus to be meaningful. In our possible restructuringscenarios published on Aug
        10, we assumed a surplus of USD100-200 million.<br/><br/>
        Can the 2018s get par.<br/><br/>
        As the earliest maturing debt after the BBFs and their relatively smalloutstanding at USD379 million, there is a
        small camp that believes the 2018scould get par. Stars will need to be really aligned for this to happen. The
        twokey constraints we see are availability of cash and approval from the RCFs.<br/><br/>
        Given cash burn and lack of meaningful surplus from US asset sale, it isunlikely Noble will have sufficient cash
        in March to pay off the 2018s and haveenough left to run the business. Even if it does, the RCFs maturing in
        Maymight not approve 2018s getting par. Hence, we assign a low probability tothis event, say 25%. Note that the
        other asset sales (outside US) that Nobleexpects to generate USD800 million - USD1 billion will take time and we
        don'texpect them to close in the next 3-6 months.</p>
