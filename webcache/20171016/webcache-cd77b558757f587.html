        A legacy of the financial crisis has been the narrative of a secular decline in ratesof return. But have rates
        of return declined? This is patently the case in fixedincome where government bond yields are near all-time lows
        and credit spreadsat mid- to late cycle tights. The US 10y yield has historically been a good predictorof
        subsequent total returns, so prospective returns look unambiguously low. Alonger history suggests bond yields
        are low but not unusually so. Yields werein a 2-5% range for 65years from 1900-1965; broke out above during the
        GreatInflation of 1966-1995; then reverted back into the ¡°old normal¡± range.¡£<br/><br/>

        Macro: Flash Euro area composite PMI new orders rebounded to a six-year highof 56.3in September, up from 55.5in
        August and consistent with Euro area GDPgrowth of 3%+ (slide 6). However, PMI momentum ¨C the six-month change
        inthe PMI and a key determinant of European equity market momentum ¨C remainsclose to zero, having peaked at
        +4points in February. We think the current levelof the PMI is unlikely to be sustained, given that: (a) PMIs are
        consistent with GDPgrowth significantly above our economists¡¯ forecasts (2.2% for this year, 2.0% for2018) and
        consensus (2.1% for 2017, 1.8% for 2018); and (b) the PMI has overshotthe level suggested by the Euro area
        credit impulse, which, at 0.1% of GDP, isconsistent with a PMI of 51. We expect the PMI to fade back to around
        53byyear-end, consistent with our economists¡¯ growth projections. This would implyPMI momentum turning negative
        over the coming months.¡£<br/><br/>

        The BoE¡¯s conviction for a November hike contained the caveats that (a) dataremained resilient and (b) political
        and EU Referendum uncertainty did notmaterially deteriorate. Data momentum has recovered from summer lows
        whilePM May¡¯s speech last week, and the EU¡¯s response, suggests there is now littleleft in the BoE¡¯s way. With
        two hikes now priced by August-18, the very frontend is now excessively steep to measures of term premium and we
        exit the6m1Y-2Y1Y Sonia steepener¡£</p>
