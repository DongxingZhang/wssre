    <p> Land price in all Chinese cities rose 88% on average since Q12016。<br/><br/>
        This is much faster than property prices which rose by 26% over the same period(Figure 1). The land market boom
        spread to lower tier cities in 2017, with pricesup by 60% in tier 3cities that are close to tier 1and 2cities,
        and by 37% in othertier 3cities.。<br/><br/>
        This market boom is mostly driven by government policies. The centralgovernment announced in March that it aims
        to help tier 3cities to de-stockthe housing inventory. Policies were tightened in tier 1and 2cities this year
        topush investors and developers to tier 3cities. Many local governments announcedspecific measures to boost
        property market, such as cutting land supply andstopping supply of public housing.。<br/><br/>
        Positive macro implication in the short term。<br/><br/>
        The land market boom helps to boost fiscal revenue and improve LGFVs' financialcondition. Land sales account for
        24% of revenue for total government and 43%for local government in 2016. Land auctions are up 40% yoy in Q3and
        helpedfiscal revenue (Figure 2). Local government financing vehicles likely benefit fromland market boom as land
        constitute a large part of their assets.。<br/><br/>
        The land market boom pushes up property prices and generates a huge wealtheffect. 2017is the first year the
        wealth effect from the housing market becamehigher than household disposable incomes in tier 3cities (Figure 3).
        It drives upimports and reduces China's current account surplus.。<br/><br/>
        Challenge and risk in the next few years: how to make land price sustainable?<br/><br/>
        The land market boom will likely exacerbate macro risks beyond 2017, particularin tier 3cities. They account for
        57.4% of urban population, 61.5% of floor spaceunder construction, and 59.2% of GDP in China. Fundamentals in
        many of thesecities cannot justify the boom -- housing and land inventories are already high,while economic and
        population growth are slowing.。<br/><br/>
        China needs to find a more sustainable strategy in the land and property market.It requires a lower and more
        flexible growth target, a fiscal reform to facilitatetransfer between regions with strong economy and the rest
        of countries, and aset of policies in the property market that focuses on the long run. As President Xisaid:
        houses are supposed to be for people to live in (instead for speculation). Thisis likely to be a major challenge
        for the new group of leaders in the next five years.。</p>
