    <p> Yesterday, Chief Executive (CE) of the Hong Kong SAR, Carrie Lam, delivered hermaiden Policy Address to the
        Legislative Council (LegCo). With little surprise, theprimary focus of the Policy Address was to alleviate the
        burdens on the public. Theimminent issues of housing were addressed, and changes to taxation and thegovernment¡¯s
        structure were also proposed. Lam thinks Hong Kong¡¯s economy issound and expects GDP to grow by more than 3.5%
        in 2017, in line with the currentofficial government forecast of 3-4%, and above the long-term growth rate of
        2.9%.<br/><br/>
        Introducing the ¡°Starter Homes¡± pilot scheme aims to provide affordable housingfor first-time buyers who are
        priced out of the private property market.<br/><br/>
        To increase home ownership in Hong Kong, the government is planning tosubstantially increase the supply of units
        under the Green Form SubsidisedHome Ownership Scheme (GSH).<br/><br/>
        The government proposes to introduce a two-tiered corporate tax system, withthe tax rate on the first HKD2m of
        profits reduced to 8.25%. Profits above thatamount will be taxed at the standard profit tax rate of
        16.5%.<br/><br/>
        An additional tax break will be given to companies that spend on R&amp;D.; The firstHKD2m of R&amp;D; spending
        is eligible for a 300% tax deduction; R&amp;D; spendingabout HKD2m is eligible for a 200% tax
        deduction.<br/><br/>
        In terms of public finances, the government said it is in a position to use theaccumulated fiscal reserves
        prudently (currently at HKD1,000bn) to invest for thefuture of the city, as well as to alleviate the burdens on
        the public.</p>
