    <p> Strong GRMs in Q2FY18 to boost earnings. Led by the sharp spike in refiningmargins in late Aug¡¯17 and then
        Sep¡¯17, the Singapore complex GRMs have averagedUSD8.2/b for Q2FY18. The hurricanes in the US were one of the
        key reasons for theGRMs jumping up. In addition, the Brent crude price also averaged slightly higher
        atUSD51.7/b, against USD50.1/b in Q1FY18. The closing Brent crude prices for Q1 &amp; Q2quarters show a starker
        difference of more than USD8/b. Considering the quarterlyBrent crude averages for Q1FY17 &amp; Q2FY18, we
        estimate that Oil MarketingCompanies (OMCs) should benefit by roughly USD1/bbl of inventory gains in
        Q2FY18.<br/><br/>
        Overall, the combined effect (GRMs + inventory gain) implies that the OMCs are likelyto report GRMs of
        USD8.5-9.0/b even on a conservative basis. On the marketing side,based on the data released so far until Aug¡¯17
        by the Ministry of Petroleum &amp; NaturalGas, we are expecting volume growth 3-4% y-o-y for Q2FY18 for OMCs for
        allpetroleum products. Also, note that this will be first quarter where GST impact will beseen on OMCs¡¯ earnings
        and this will be key data point for which to look out.<br/><br/>
        HPCL &amp; BPCL likely to see sharpest improvement sequentially. Based on our Q2FY18estimates, HPCL and BPCL
        should report the sharpest improvement in earnings q-o-q asapart from the GRM benefit, the inventory gains will
        aid the marketing EBITDA as well. ForIOC, the pipeline and petchem earnings are likely to be steadier.<br/><br/>
        We continue to like HPCL within OMCs. HPCL¡¯s stock (up 50% YTD) has outperformedIOC by 22% and BPCL by 36% YTD
        driven by robust marketing business earnings andoverall sharp earnings improvement. We continue to like HPCL
        within OMCs as we feelthat it provides much superior earnings predictability due to 60-70% earnings coming
        frommarketing business. Further, though it is entering a capex cycle, the RoE profile of 20%+will still warrant
        valuation multiples that are higher than the current valuations. We retainBuy on HPCL and Holds on BPCL &amp;
        IOC.</p>
