    <p> We invited Mr. Xue Tao, Executive Director of the E20 Environmental IndustryResearch Institute, to make a
        presentation at the dbAccess China conference. Wesummarize the key takeaways.<br/><br/>
        Impact from recent regulations on PPP.<br/><br/>
        Both MoF¡¯s policy paper #92 and the new regulations on asset management willaffect PPP projects financing.
        However he believes that most projects affected willbe environment renovation projects, rather than projects
        with end-user payments(i.e. projects with significant operations revenue). Some environment renovationprojects
        ¡°signed-up¡± (under the definition of MoF) may not be able to obtain bankloans ¨C in the case of Sichuan for
        example, only 30% of the signed-up projectshave obtained bank loans. If the project cannot be executed, the
        project companywill be fined (though the amount is unlikely to be significant). It is required inMoF¡¯s policy
        paper #92 that part of the payments for construction should be doneafter evaluating project performance, and
        therefore actual receivables collectioncould take longer than previously expected.<br/><br/>
        PPP project database cleanup.<br/><br/>
        The cleanup of PPP project database is likely to be completed in March 2018. Xueexpects most projects taken out
        of the database to be projects not yet signedup, and he expects strict scrutiny for future projects to be
        included. For someprovinces, budgets for projects in the database have got close to the 10% limitof their
        financial budget.<br/><br/>
        Comparison of different environmental projects.<br/><br/>
        Waste to Energy. WTE is still the most popular project type in environmentalamong the companies. With the
        development of waste sorting, there will bemore treatment projects specifically for particular types of waste
        (e.g. projectsspecifically for kitchen waste). China is likely to have sufficient WTE capacitiesafter three
        years while most new project awards by then will be projects relatedto sludge treatment and kitchen waste
        treatment.<br/><br/>
        Environmental sanitation. This is the second most popular project type amongthe companies. Sanitation companies
        generally seek IRR of ~12%. Expenditureon sanitation by the government should increase one year after another on
        higherenvironmental standards. Most sanitation projects are paid by district level fiscal budgets rather than at
        city level. The price of long-term projects is based onnegotiation, which rises if the government's requirements
        go up.<br/><br/>
        Air pollution treatment. Large-scale projects in desulfurization and denitrificationhave mostly been completed.
        Projects now are mainly small-scale projects indesulfurization and denitrification, as well as projects in VOC,
        which are normallyalso small-scale.<br/><br/>
        Hazardous Waste Treatment. The valuation in HWT M&amp;A; projects is complicatedas projects vary from one to
        another, and thus the profitability of M&amp;A; project isdifficult to forecast.</p>
