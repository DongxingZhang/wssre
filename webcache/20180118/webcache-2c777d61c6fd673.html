    <p> Macro: 2018Outlook ¨C From the Juglar cycle to ¡°engineer dividend¡±<br/><br/>
        In this Macro outlook report, we focus on stability in the Chinese economy, the main economic andasset themes of
        2017and whether they will continue in 2018, which industry chains will influencethe economy this year, and the
        outlook for exports, investment, consumption, inflation and policy. Asnominal GDP growth becomes slower and less
        volatile in 2018, we expect real GDP growth to alsomoderate slightly in 2018, with earnings-driven stock market
        momentum to weaken. Investmentopportunities should remain limited to a few certain sectors.<br/><br/>
        Banking: Review of recent policies for the Chinese banking sector<br/><br/>
        Financial deleveraging is set to continue along with capital structure adjustments at small andmedium-sized
        banks, although the period of greatest pressure has now passed. Given gradualinterest re-pricing of assets and
        better liability management, overall NIM should improve steadily in2018. Banking asset quality will also improve
        amid an economic recovery, helping to enhance thesector¡¯s valuation. Given steadily improved fundamentals as
        well as investment opportunitiesbrought about by valuation enhancements, we maintain our Positive rating on the
        Chinese bankingsector and continue to recommend banks with strong fundamentals.</p>
