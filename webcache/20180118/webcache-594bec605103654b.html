    <p> CBRC advocated strengthening regulations; credit growth will slow further<br/><br/>
        New loans of Rmb548bn and TSF of Rmb1.14tr fell short of consensus for Dec2017, leading to slower credit growth
        of 13.8% (Nov: 14.4%), if adjusted formuni bonds and equity financing. In 2018, we expect credit growth to slow
        to12-13% yoy (Fig 1), given continued tightening. The CBRC announced on 13Jan it will deepen regulatory controls
        on incompliant activities. After 8monthsof self-checking by banks, which unveiled Rmb17.6tr incompliant assets
        (7% oftotal banking assets), the CBRC has shifted focus from self-checking torequiring rectification, which
        could impose pressure on capital and earnings ofsmaller banks. We remain cautious on corporate-orientated banks.<br/><br/>
        Circular No.4in 2018¨C Further deepening controls on incompliant transactions<br/><br/>
        The CBRC in Apr 2017issued a handful of tighter regulations, known as ¡°3-3-4-10¡± series, which required
        comprehensive self-checking by banks mainly oninterbank and shadow banking businesses. The results were recently
        unveiledindicating that there were Rmb17.6tr assets in total identified as incompliant.Following that, on the
        evening of 13Jan, the CBRC issued Circular No. 4topropose further strengthening in implementation. In our view,
        the CBRC in2018might focus more on the rectification of such incompliant assets,especially related to corporate
        governance, shadow banking, fraudulentmarketing and corruption, etc. Together with other tighter regulations
        andhigher market rates (note), we expect wholesale-funded and shadow-bankingcentricbanks to continuously be
        subject to earnings and capital pressure (2018outlook). As such, we continue to prefer retail-orientated banks
        (pecking order:BOC/ABC/CCB/ICBC/CRCB/BoCom).<br/><br/>
        Credit mix ¨C shadow banking temporarily rebounded<br/><br/>
        Adjusted credit growth (including municipal bonds) of 13.8% yoy this monthwas the slowest in the past 30months.
        Looking at the breakdown, loangrowth decelerated to 12.7% yoy (vs. 13.3% in Nov), while shadow bankingcomponents
        (entrusted loans, trust loans and undiscounted bills) rebounded to31% of Dec TSF versus 22% in 1H17. However, we
        expect shadow bankingcredit to shrink in 2018given a series of recent tightening rules, e.g. assetmanagement
        guidelines, bank-trust cooperation, entrusted loans, etc.<br/><br/>
        Who is borrowing? Corporates levered up while household moderated<br/><br/>
        A breakdown by borrowers suggests that corporates have levered up whilehousehold moderated in Dec 2017, with
        their new credit making up 45%/22%of the new system credit (30%/29% in Oct); government borrowing narrowedto 25%
        of the total new credit. For households, monthly new short-term retailloans declined sharply to Rmb11bn in Dec
        2017vs. avg volume of Rmb165bnin 11M17. Mortgage loan growth slowed to 22% yoy in Dec (Nov: 23%).<br/><br/>
        Who is lending? Asset growth decelerated across the board<br/><br/>
        China¡¯s banking assets growth slowed to 9.2% yoy in Nov (vs. 15.7% in 2016).By lenders, asset growth was dragged
        down by smaller banks. Total assetgrowth of joint-stock and city/rural banks (44% of total banking
        assets)decelerated to 10% yoy in Nov from 19% in 2016. The big banks¡¯ (36% of totalbanking assets) asset growth
        stayed stable at 7.1% yoy in Nov (Oct: 7.2%).</p>
