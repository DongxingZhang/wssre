    <p> Longfor announced proposed 5.25-year and 10-year USD bonds; our prelimthoughts are below<br/><br/>
        Longfor (issuer rating of Baa3/BBB-/BBB) announced a proposal of a 5.25-yearbond at IPT of +200bp area and a
        10-year USD bond at IPT of +235bp area,according to Bloomberg. LNGFOR 3.875% 2022s trade at ask price of
        99.94,YTW of 3.89% and G+165bp as we write. According to its group conferencecall earlier today, Longfor
        received USD 800mn of quota from NDRC for USDbonds. On Dec 20, Moody¡¯s upgraded Longfor¡¯s issue rating from
        Ba1to Baa3;<br/><br/>
        on Jan 4, Fitch upgraded Longfor¡¯s issuer and issue rating from BBB- to BBB.Within the Asia Credit USD space,
        there are very few issuers which are BBBratedwith non-SOE backgrounds that have a 5and 10-year curve where wecan
        gauge specifically how much spread pick-up Longfor¡¯s 10-year bondsshould be.<br/><br/>
        JD.com is one of them but tech has traded much tighter than China property.<br/><br/>
        We can take a rough proxy from BBB- rated Adani Ports; Adani Ports (ADSEZ)2022s (issue rating of BBB-) trade at
        ask yield 3.40%, G+122bp as we write,and ADSEZ 2027s trade at ask yield 4.08%, G+161bp, leading to a
        39-bpdifference in 5/10s. We believe that Longfor¡¯s new 10-year bond should trade35-40bp wider than its 5-year
        bond, hence at around G+205bp. As for theproposed 5.25-year bond, it has a maturity of about 9months longer
        thanLNGFOR 2022s, and we see the fair value of the proposed LNGFOR 2023s tobe about G+170bp (though we believe
        it could trade tighter due to the NDRCquota not being big). In our view, the lack of good-quality non-SOE
        ChinaBBB- names should also provide some support to the Longfor¡¯s new 5.25-yearand 10-year bonds. LNGFOR¡¯s
        proposed 10-year is likely to trade tighter thanG+205bp, in our view, and we believe the target fair value after
        factoringscarcity value is G+195bp in the medium-run. This would also put it to asimilar fair value as
        Sino-Ocean 2027s (ask price: 111.4, YTM: 4.41%,G+195bp) as we write, and Sino-Ocean¡¯s largest shareholder is SOE
        China Life.<br/><br/>
        Strong developer with good landbank, robust growth and prudent financialmanagement<br/><br/>
        Longfor¡¯s 11M17contract sales aggregated to RMB148.4bn, up 85% YoY,more robust than our prior expectation. Its
        rich landbank and good salesexecution should enable it to post at least 25% YoY growth in contract salesfor
        2018, in our view. As of end-June, Longfor¡¯s attributable landbank reached37.1mn sq m. Management remains
        proactive in landbanking, havingacquired about 2.8mn sq m in 3Q17. By end of July, it also had rentalapartments
        open in 7cities, and long-term rental apartments are an area thatthe government is supporting. The developer¡¯s
        credit positives include prudentfinancial management, diversified landbank, growing recurrent income,
        goodcorporate culture, and strong credit metrics. We believe Longfor¡¯s creditmetrics will continue to improve.
        As shown in its 1H17results, Longfor¡¯sgross rental income rose by 28.8% YoY to RMB1.1bn, thanks to additions
        ofnew malls and good organic growth at some Paradise Walk malls.<br/><br/>
        Risks<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks include slower sales due to further credit and policytightening, and unexpected macro shocks.
        Key upside risks include strongerthan-expected sales, rental income or margin recovery, and
        conservativelandbanking.</p>
