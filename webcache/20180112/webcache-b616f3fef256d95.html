    <p> Colombia holds legislative and presidential elections this year. The process should reach itshigh point on 11
        March, when Colombians vote to fill all seats in the lower and upper houses ofthe Congress. Polls suggest the
        outcome will be fragmented and that the winner of thissummer¡¯s presidential election will have to work with
        rivals to get approval on issues that areexpected to be at the forefront in the campaign: taxation, pensions,
        employment and publicsafety. At the same time, opinion polls have to be seen in the context of a relatively poor
        recenttrack record (see Colombia: 2018 election roadmap, dated 27 November 2017).<br/><br/>
        Leading recent presidential opinion polls is the left-of-centre candidate Sergio Fajardo, whoseeconomic policy
        strategy has raised doubts in markets and who is part of a coalition that has neverheld federal office (see
        Colombia: Election tracker, 22 December). In contrast, some centre-rightcandidates have promised tax cuts and
        even reviewing the current fiscal rule to meet budgettargets. We will keep a close eye on the ¨C occasionally,
        apparently contradictory ¨C proposalsemerging in campaign publicity, debates and the press prior to the first
        round on 27 May (and apossible second one on 17 June).<br/><br/>
        Uncertainties surrounding the electoral platforms should increase the importance of the earlypolicy decisions of
        the president-elect, who will take office on 7 August. The inauguration of thenew Congress on 21 June should
        give a clear picture of the incoming government¡¯s supportwithin Congress and thus its ability to implement
        needed reforms.<br/><br/>
        Following the downgrade of Colombia¡¯s sovereign credit rating to BBB? by S&amp;P; in December,there is concern
        that other rating agencies might follow suit. The 2018 budget plans lookchallenging. The target of a 7% y/y
        increase in revenues might be frustrated by only gradualrecovery in activity, and risks might arise from the
        fiscal rule coming under jeopardy. Althoughwe do not expect oil production to grow by much, higher crude prices
        might benefit the publicaccounts, as was the case in 2017. The government concluded last year on a positive
        note,meeting its target of a budget balance target and even managing savings worth 0.3% of GDP.<br/><br/>
        Following the budget changes made by Congress (see Colombia: How soon is now), we expectthe incumbent government
        to announce additional budget cuts in June¡¯s medium-term fiscalplan revision. With the finance ministry
        projecting public investment to remain around 4% ofGDP (and infrastructure-related spending expected to grow by
        7% y/y), we see room for furtheradjustment after the elections, as happened in previous electoral
        cycles.<br/><br/>
        Finally, the second-quarter inflation report and the evolution of core components are especiallyrelevant to
        monetary policy. With activity likely to be gathering steam by the end of this year butstill running below
        potential, September¡¯s report should gauge the central bank¡¯s disposition tocontinue its expansionary monetary
        policy. We expect the policy rate to end this year at 4.0%after three more 25bp cuts, with some further
        tightening in 2019.</p>
