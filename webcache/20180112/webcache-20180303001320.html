    <p> China property accounts for over 40% of NWD¡¯s NAV.<br/><br/>
        NWD¡¯s property projects are located mainly in southern China. Last year, contracted sales in China
        exceededHK$18bn, and we expect 2018 presales to be at approximately same level. More than 1.7m sqm of this will
        becompleted and booked in FY18, a 30% YoY increase. Furthermore, it is possible that some of the land bank
        inother parts of the country will be considered non-core and disposed of. NWD has sold more than RMB20bn
        ofnon-core properties since 2016, and another RMB20bn may be unlocked in the future.<br/><br/>
        Victoria Dockside will underpin NWD¡¯s rental income.<br/><br/>
        Recently, it was reported that the office block of New World development¡¯s Victoria Dockside was leased atHK$95
        psf per month, a high for Kowloon office space. This will help boost NWD¡¯s rental income from VictoriaDockside
        to HK$2bn from 2019. This is approximately a 10% return on the $20bn investment in VictoriaDockside, which has a
        total GFA of 3 million sq.ft., and it should significantly boost rental income for NWD,which was HK$2.4bn last
        year.<br/><br/>
        HK home prices expected to remain stable in 2018 on positive Mainland investment demand.<br/><br/>
        The consensus view is that home prices, which increased about 14% in 2017, are not very high and may stayflat or
        increase mildly by 10% in 2018. The risk is higher mortgage rates, rising above the 4% level or
        higher.<br/><br/>
        Currently, they are at the low level of 2-2.5%.</p>
