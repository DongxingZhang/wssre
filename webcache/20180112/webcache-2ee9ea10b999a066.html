        Analysts Awaiting Guidance Before Adjusting Estimates.<br/><br/>
        Analysts have adjusted their 2018 forecasts by less than 2% for recent taxchanges, a fraction of the likely
        impact. During reporting season, investors willbe focused on guidance around (1) each company's new effective
        tax rate, (2)plans to redeploy capital back into businesses, (3) impacts on EPS fromincreased buybacks, and (4)
        the potential for higher dividends. We expectconservative guidance given the recency of new legislation. This
        should leadto above average revisions throughout 2018, as shown below.<br/><br/>
        Recent Dividend and Buyback Trends to Reverse.<br/><br/>
        In 2017, companies returned less capital to shareholders, with dividend yieldsfalling to 1.8% (from 2.2%) and
        the contribution of buybacks to EPS 1.3%(from 2.2%). We expect these trends to reverse in 2018, on stronger
        after-taxcashflows and repatriated overseas cash. The S&amp;P; 500 now yields far lessthan EAFE (3.0%) and
        Treasuries (2.5%). Reversing these trends shouldenhance the attractiveness of U.S. stocks.<br/><br/>
        4Q17 EPS Likely to Growth 14-15%.<br/><br/>
        4Q earnings will kick off later this week with the Banks. Consensus projectionspoint to EPS growth of 11.5%.
        Bottom-line growth will likely finish between 14-15%, after factoring in a typical pace of beats. Easy comps in
