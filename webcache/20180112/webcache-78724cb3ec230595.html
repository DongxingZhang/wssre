    <p> Solid growth to continue with multiple catalysts ahead.<br/><br/>
        The two key take-aways include 1) Hengrui already filed PD1 application in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        We believe the indications are cHL and esophageal cancer, which is earlier thanstreet consensus. This led to
        stock rally on Tuesday. Additionally the companyexpects approval in 2018; 2) Hengrui expects growth acceleration
        in 2018. Webelieve this might be a combination of delayed booking of export profit andother unspecified
        elements. For 2017, Hengrui reiterated 18-20% domestic salesgrowth and 20% exports growth. As for the products
        breakdown, traditionaloncology/ anesthetics/ contrast agents should reach 10-15%, 20% and over 30%growth
        respectively in 2017. In addition, lower pricing erosion could be witnessedin FY18 compared with FY17, as
        secondary negotiations and tenders are largelyconcluded.<br/><br/>
        Apatinib growth likely to accelerate in 2018; 4Q17 hiccup.<br/><br/>
        The company indicated that apatinib sales was below expectation in 2017,due to slowdown in 4Q17 stemming from
        NRDL settlement/ implementationdelays and budget controls. Hengrui remains optimistic on 2018 outlook drivenby
        reimbursement coverage. Despite the 36% nominal ASP cut of apatinib,management believes the upside could very
        well outweigh pricing erosion. Assuch, management welcomes negotiations for NRDL/ PRDL rolling inclusionfor key
        innovative products. In addition, indication expansion studies for livercancer and NSCLC are both progressing to
        final stages, with approval expectedin 2H18-2019.<br/><br/>
        Updates on pipeline and other key takeaways.<br/><br/>
        Four blockbusters are likely to be approved including nab-paclitaxel, 19K,pyrotinib and PD-1. Hengrui commented
        on bigger addressable market forpyrotinib vs. apatinib, on the back of longer treatment duration, without
        offeringany color on pricing strategy. On nab-paclitaxel, Hengrui and CSPC are both onpriority review list, with
        the possibility of obtaining approvals simultaneously. Asfor R&amp;D; spending, the ratio is likely to remain at
        current level, as expense increasewill synchronize with sales growth. On management incentive, the
        companyimplemented 3 rounds in 2014/16/17, with near-term plan of another round, using3m reserved shares.</p>
