    <p> Heart &amp; brain drugs stunned 1st batch of consistency evaluation.<br/><br/>
        On 29 Dec 2017, China’s FDA announced the first batch of 17 generic drug namesfor consistency evaluation on
        their quality and efficacy (仿制药质量和疗效一致性评价). Twelve of them were heart &amp; brain medicines, among ten of which
        beinganti-hypertension drugs. The other five drugs were antibiotics, anti-psychotic drugs,anti-cancer and
        anti-viral for hepatitis and HIV. The latter anti-viral medicine fromChengdu Brilliant Pharma (成都倍特药业) was
        generic version of Tenofovir?(Disoproxil Fumarate) at 300mg, similar to Sinobiopharm’s (1177.HK,
        NR)Qingzhong.<br/><br/>
        Sinobiopharm’s Tuotuo passed consistency evaluation.<br/><br/>
        For HK-listed drug-maker, only one medicine was included into the list, namelySinobiopharm’s Tuotuo 托妥?
        (Rosuvastatin Calcium Tablets 瑞舒伐他汀钙片).<br/><br/>
        This medicine, as a generic version of Crestor?, is well known to its cholesterollowering efficacy. Other heart
        and brain medicines on that list include genericversions of (1) Plavix? (Clopidogrel); (2) Monopril? (Fosinopril
        sodium); (3) Avapro?(Irbesartan HCl); (4) Zestril? or Prinivil? (Lisinopril); and (5) Cozaar?
        (Losartanpotassium). The generic version of Gefitinib Tablets (吉非替尼片) (anti-cancer)from a China A-share listed
        player had also been included into the list. It is worthnoting that, its tender price in 2017 stood at RMB1,680
        per box (250mg) fromGuangxi Province, 29% discount to the original medicine (Iressa?) from AstraZeneca of
        RMB2,358 per box in Hubei and Sichuan Provinces.<br/><br/>
        Consistency evaluation raises China drug-making standard.<br/><br/>
        As cited by CFDA newsletter, consistent with government policy to provide qualitymedicine to Chinese masses, we
        see consistency evaluation will (1) improve themedicine production level from Chinese drug-makers, (2) guarantee
        drug safetyand effectiveness, (3) promote the sector’s technology upgrades; and (4) raisetheir global
        competitiveness. We expect more preferential selection of thoseChinese drug-makers whose medicines had passed
        the consistency evaluationduring central procurement from hospitals.<br/><br/>
        Big is better for consistency evaluation.<br/><br/>
        Note that, if there are more than three producers of the similar drug type (or drugstructure) getting qualified
        in consistency evaluation, those drug type or structurefailing to pass consistency evaluation shall not be
        selected in centralizedprocurement for hospitals. Moreover, we reckon that those medicines from biggerand
        reputed Chinese drug-makers would likely fulfill the consistency evaluationtests. Those HK-listed Chinese
        drug-makers with large capacities to produce qualitygeneric drugs include (1) Sinobiopharm; (2) CSPC (1093.HK,
        NR) and (3) FosunPharm (2196.HK, NR).</p>
