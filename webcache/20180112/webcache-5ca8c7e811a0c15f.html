        did not make any changes to the Medium-term and Long-term Portfolios.<br/><br/>
        December Performance. The CGS Top 10 Monthly Portfolio registered a loss of 0.96% in December 2017,
        underperforming the CSI 300 Index by 1.58ppts. The Medium-term Portfolio gained 2.36%, outperforming the CSI 300
        Index by 1.74ppts; while the Long-term Portfolio gained 0.22%, lagging behind the CSI 300 Index by
        0.4ppt.<br/><br/>
        January Outlook. External markets may remain an important factor affecting A shares. The US President Donald
        Trump¡¯s trade protectionism and passage of the tax reform are all variables to consider. The rebound of the
        Dollar in the medium term will probably impose further pressure on the RMB. We expect the domestic economy to
        remain relatively stable in January, regulations on financial activities to further tighten and risk appetite to
        improve. Monetary policy will remain prudent, and liquidity at the macro-level will likely be slightly tight.
        Fiscal policy and reforms will continue to have an impact. We expect a range bound trading pattern in the stock
        market with structural opportunities. Investors should be aware of ¡°black swan¡± events.<br/><br/>
        Investment Portfolios: We establish three investment portfolios of different investment periods to cater for the
        various needs and risk preferences of investors.<br/><br/>
