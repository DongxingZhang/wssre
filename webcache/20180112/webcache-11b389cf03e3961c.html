    <p> 2018 Outlook view: In our EMEA Fixed Income outlook published in early December, we argued that Turkish local
        bonds have the most room to rally across all EMEA fixed income markets; however, risks remain high in light of
        geopolitical developments, FX sensitivity to external shocks and the CBT reaction function to the expected
        decline in inflation pressure. We also highlighted steepeners as one of our preferred choices; however, we
        argued that first some FX stabilization was needed for the latter to perform.<br/><br/>
        What happened? Turkish fixed income ended the year on a strong foot. As a result of a decline in geopolitical
        tension with the EU and the US as well as global tailwinds, FX stabilized and 10Y bonds rallied by 30bp since
        mid-Dec to now 11.75% Although the December inflation print surprised somewhat to the upside, price pressure
        nevertheless declined due to positive base effect.<br/><br/>
        We now see the timing and valuation as attractive to enter steepeners in the Turkish XCCY swap curve.</p>
