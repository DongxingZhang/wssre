    <p> There are no substantial changes from the last update. Model results do not showany drop in price for the next
        months.<br/><br/>
        Factoring the last macro releases from China in, the fair value would be USD77.6/tonne now (error bands USD
        60.5-94.7/tonne); conditional projection for Q22018 points to a price of USD 74.8/tonne. Model projects the ore
        at USD 72.9/tonnefor Q4 2018 (error bands USD 55.9-89.9/tonne).<br/><br/>
        The upper band of the model is above USD 90/tonne, reason why we don¡¯t rule outthat the upward trend of iron ore
        price continues in the coming months.<br/><br/>
        We have no allocation on the ore: market price has been within error bands. Weclosed a long position when the
        target of USD 68/tonne was reached in 24November 2017.</p>
