    <p> The Hang Seng Composite Index will conduct its regular half-yearly review in mid-February.<br/><br/>
        Any potential changes in constituent stocks will also affect the eligible stock list for southboundStock
        Connect. Given the increasing participation of Mainland investors throughsouthbound trading, it will be a major
        share price catalyst if a stock is included in the HangSeng Large Cap, Mid Cap or Small Cap Indices. We believe
        investors should pay attentionto these candidates: China Literature (0772.HK), Yixin Group (2858.HK), Razer
        (1337.HK),Crystal International (2232.HK), Virscend Education (1565.HK), Wisdom Education(6068.HK), China New
        Higher Education (2001.HK), Yongda Auto (3669.HK), Zhongyu Gas(3633.HK), Tianlun Gas (1600.HK) and Xiabuxiabu
        (0520.HK).<br/><br/>
        Half-yearly review of Hang Seng Composite Index to be conducted in mid-February.<br/><br/>
        As the regular review will involve potential changes in constituent stocks in the Hang SengLarge Cap, Mid Cap
        and Small Cap Indices, the results will also lead to changes in the stocklist for southbound Stock Connect
        trading (for stocks with an average market cap of&gt;HK$5bn, based on the month-end market cap in the past 12
        months (only the H-sharemarket cap is counted for H-shares)).<br/><br/>
        Significant impact if the stocks are in hot sectors. For instance, when Meitu (1357.HK)was included in the Stock
        Connect list in March 2017, its share price surged 78% in lessthan two weeks. The share price of Yuhua Education
        (6169.HK) also jumped &gt;50% withintwo months after the announcement of its inclusion into the Stock Connect
        list in mid-August2017.<br/><br/>
        Large cap IPOs, especially TMT related, are likely to be the focus. We believe ChinaLiterature, Yixin Group,
        Razer and Crystal International should easily be able to meet themarket cap and trading volume requirements.
        China Literature, Yixin Group and Razer, inparticular, should be well received by Mainland investors if they are
        added to the Stock Connectlist, as they are TMT or fintech related.<br/><br/>
        Education stocks also deserve close monitoring. Based on the impressive share priceperformance track record of
        Maple Leaf Education (1317.HK) and Yuhua Education aftertheir inclusion into the Stock Connect list, investors
        should closely monitor potential candidatesin the education sector. We believe Virscend Education, Wisdom
        Education and ChinaNew Education have the potential to be included, as their average market caps (basedon the
        month-end market cap in the past 12 months) have significantly exceeded HK$5bnwith good trading
        volume.<br/><br/>
        Gas utilities stocks are potential candidates after a sector re-rating. Thanks to the reratingof the gas
        utilities sector in 2H17, some smaller gas utilities companies, includingZhongyu Gas and Tianlun Gas, now meet
        the average market cap requirement.<br/><br/>
        Other interesting candidates. Given the very impressive share price performance of autodealer companies last
        year, we expect to see a positive response if Yongda Auto is addedto the Stock Connect list. Investors may also
        pay attention to Xiabuxiabu, China OverseasProperty (2669.HK) and Consun Pharma (1681.HK).<br/><br/>
        Potential stocks to be removed. Colour Life (1778.HK) and CGN New Energy (1811.HK)may be removed from the Stock
        Connect list, as their market cap is below HK$5bn. However,since they are only slightly below this threshold, we
        don¡¯t rule out the possibility that theymay remain on the list during the upcoming review.</p>
