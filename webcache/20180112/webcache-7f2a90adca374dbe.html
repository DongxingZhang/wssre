    <p> South Africa: Will he stay or will he go?<br/><br/>
        There have been numerous reports (Bloomberg, January 8, 2018) that PresidentZuma may be asked to step down in
        the coming weeks if not days. Unconfirmedreports (Bloomberg, January 8, 2018) initially suggested, but were
        subsequentlydenied, that recalling President Zuma may be on the agenda of the NationalExecutive Committee (NEC)
        meeting on January 10. However, events over theweekend suggest that negotiations are far from over. Elected
        president of theANC, Ramaphosa moved quickly to shore-up support. Should Ramaphosa takeover as the president of
        the country, a cabinet re-shuffle would have to followshortly after and likely ahead of the February 21budget
        announcement. ThePresident of the country does not need support of the National Assembly fora government
        reshuffle. Markets are likely to view a recall of President Zumaas highly positive. Ramaphosa is widely
        perceived to be more reform- friendlyand a government headed by him would be expected to deliver on
        structuralreforms leading to improved business sentiment and stronger growth. Should thegovernment deliver a
        promising budget in February, further downgrades by creditratings agencies could be avoided. See EMEA Snap on

        Brazil: Golden Rule debate stresses fiscal disequilibrium<br/><br/>
        In Brazil, the government announced on Monday that it would no longer seek topass a constitutional amendment
        revoking the so-called ¡°Golden Rule¡± (wherebythe government must not issue net debt in excess of public
        investment in agiven year) now. The announcement was made after Lower House SpeakerRodrigo Maia criticized
        Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles for arguing that theamendment revoking the Golden Rule should include
        compensatory austeritymeasures and claimed that the Lower House would not discuss the measurethis year. In our
        opinion, the Golden Rule is a legal constraint that will eventuallybe infringed due to the government¡¯s failure
        in reining in mandatory spending,regardless of whether Congress passes the pension reform this year (as the
        reformwill not produce significant savings in the near term), in the same way that theceiling on expenditures
        will sooner or later be breached under the status quo.While the Golden Rule will probably not be an issue this
        year because the federalgovernment expects to receive back BRL130bn in debt owed by BNDES, it willmost likely be
        violated in 2019, when officials forecast a shortfall of BRL150bnto BRL200bn. Consequently, we expect Congress
        to change the rule after theOctober elections. Nevertheless, the main point is that, with or without the
        GoldenRule, Brazil must restore fiscal sustainability by creating conditions to eliminate itsprimary fiscal
        deficit over the next few years. Given the size of the current primarydeficit (larger than 2% of GDP), budget
        rigidity and ballooning social securitydeficit, this will require not only passing a pension reform as soon as
        possiblebut also raising taxes (which will probably happen only after the election), in ouropinion.</p>
