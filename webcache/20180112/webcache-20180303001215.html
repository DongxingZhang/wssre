        Penetrating into Lightning connectors: Sunway's Lightning connector hadbeen qualified by Apple, with shipments
        to start in 2018. Initially, it willserve as the third suppler (after Hon Hai and JAE), but Sunway is
        confidentit will gain shares in long run. Every new iPhone comes with threeLightning connectors in the box (one
        for power adapter cable, one for earpod cable, and one for audio adapter cable).<br/><br/>
        Rising dual cam penetration on iPhone: Sunway expects all three newiPhones in 2H18will have dual cam (vs only
        two models with dual cam in2H17). Their camera related mechanical parts (dual cam supporting framesand VCM
        cases) will benefit from rising dual cam penetration<br/><br/>
