    <p> Factoring in their retail capabilities.<br/><br/>
        2017 was a banner year for SG banks, with the sector share price performancethird best among Asian financials.
        While the sector is currently one of the fewin the region to have P/B of 1.4x trade above the 10-yr avg, SG
        banks do notlook expensive to us. While higher rates and stable asset quality will be keycatalysts, they also
        deserve to trade at a higher multiple as their improvingretail banking capabilities that are currently mispriced
        by the market should berecognized. Factoring these into our valuation matrix, SG banks continue tolook
        relatively attractive; with UOB the most undervalued, we upgrade it toBuy, and downgrade HSB to Sell on
        expensive valuation.<br/><br/>
        Retail-focused banks and their premium valuation.<br/><br/>
        History shows that the market is willing to pay a higher trading multiple forretail-focused banks. We have
        identified a list of quality banks in the regionwhere their current P/B trading multiples are on average double
        that of the restof the sector and their RoE differentials about 200bp higher. These banks haveconsistently
        outperformed their corporate counterparts and did so again in2017 by 12%. Heading into 2018, while the impact of
        higher rates shouldmatter to USD-driven developed market banks such as HK and SG, whatdifferentiates SG banks
        from the rest is their increased focus on the wealthmanagement/retail banking business. Given the growing
        affluent population inthe region, this segment has been one of the fastest growing in recent years.<br/><br/>
        Also, between HK and SG, both considered to be the private banking centersof Asia, SG banks are seen as early
        successes in this space.<br/><br/>
        HK vs. SG banks: the rise of private/consumer banking for Singapore banks.<br/><br/>
        HK and SG share many similarities, one of them being beneficiaries of risingwealth in their economies. However,
        there is a divergent trend ¨C whileinvestors are pricing in potential benefits of higher rates for both markets,
        ithas yet to award SG banks for: (1) their resurgence in retail operations and (2)for going back to their
        domestic market. We also believe the market isovervaluing the HK banking sector in their (3) stronger loan
        growth demand forBoCHK, which is mostly from the lower quality corporate sector, and (4) HSB¡¯sretail banking
        capabilities, which have been slowing vs. those of SG banks. Infact, since the financial crisis in 2008, the
        proportion of assets from retailbanking has been growing at a faster pace for SG banks at a 12% CAGR, whileHK
        banks have lagged behind at 7%.<br/><br/>
        Valuing HK &amp; SG banking sectors in business mix: SG banks more attractive.<br/><br/>
        Both HK and Singapore markets should remain the key private banking centersof Asia in the long run as the banks
        will benefit from rising wealth from boththe onshore and offshore markets, which should improve retail
        bankingprofitability in the long run. Recognizing this positive catalyst, we have nowincluded the banks¡¯
        ¡°business mix¡± into our SOTP valuation models for bothmarkets. After the adoption, SG banks tend to benefit the
        most after adjustingthe misalignment in target prices. HSB looks extremely overvalued vs. peers,even factoring
        in higher multiples under business mix ¨C hence we downgradeto Sell. We have revised our RoE assumption for UOB,
        given expectation onlower incentive to provide excess GP buffer post 2018, where the bank is seento be a key
        beneficiary. We have also rolled forward our books for HK banks to2018. Please refer to our HK vs. SG banks 2018
        outlook for further details.</p>
