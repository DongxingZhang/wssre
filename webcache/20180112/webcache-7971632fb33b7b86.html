    <p> Egypt¡¯s national election authority announced yesterday that the presidentialelections will be held on March
        26-28 with the first round results beingannounced on 2nd of April and the final results (in case of a run-off)
        beingannounced on 1st of May. Although the current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,has not yet announced his
        decision to run for another term, it is expected thathe will do so and face little challenge by the virtue of
        lack of serious contenderswho enjoy significant social and political support.<br/><br/>
        Nevertheless, evidence from sporadic polls suggest that economic pressures haveled to a decline in President
        Sisi¡¯s approval ratings although a poll by the EgyptianCenter for Public Opinion Research published at the end
        of last August pointedto a slight improvement in perceptions about his Prime Minister¡¯s performance.<br/><br/>
        The most serious potential contender, Ahmed Shafik (former prime minister underMubarak), has recently officially
        announced that he will not run for the presidency.<br/><br/>
        Another potential contender is Khalid Ali, a left-wing lawyer who is running acampaign promising radical
        political and economic changes. Counting on thesupport of student and activist bodies, he is yet to emerge as a
        serious contender.<br/><br/>
        The former workers¡¯ rights activist gained fame by successfully filing a lawsuitagainst the government¡¯s
        decision to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabiaas well as wining court cases in favour of more freedom
        for syndicates and higherminimum wages. However, he himself is facing uncertainty as a court verdictdue by the
        7th of March may disqualify him from running. The military courtalso sentenced Ahmed Konsowa, an army colonel,
        to prison in December 2017after announcing his intention to run for presidency on the grounds of
        violatingrequirements of military orders. As for Mr. Konsowa, he too did not receiveenough public support to be
        regarded as a serious challenger.<br/><br/>
        Notwithstanding the domestic political fatigue stemming from pressures due toradical political and economic
        changes and reforms, Egypt¡¯s President enjoyssupport from the parliament both politically as well as for his
        economic reforms.<br/><br/>
        This is vital for ensuring a calm political environment that is supportive of IMFbackedreforms in the months
        leading up to elections. The pro-Sisi coalition hasbeen vital in ensuring an accommodative approach towards
        economic reformsand the swift approval of numerous bills referred by the government. A recentexample was the
        approval of the comprehensive health insurance bill passed onDecember 18th 2017 which requires mandatory or
        compulsory insurance for allcitizens. According to the universal health care act which will be implementedfrom
        early 2018 to 2032, the government will help those living below the povertyline with their premium payments.</p>
