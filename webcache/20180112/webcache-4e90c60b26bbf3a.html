        launch and channel restructure.<br/><br/>
        Brand equity. Its focus in 2017 was on Liushen ( for 1H17) and Herborist (for2H). It appointed brand endorsers
        Mr Hua Chenyu for Liushen and Ms Liu Tao forHerborist which helped refresh the brand image and increased brand
        awarenesseffectively. It also invested more on digital advertising to cater for new consumerbehavior trend. In
        2018, it plans to allocate more budget to other potential brands,including GF, HomeAegis and others.<br/><br/>
        Product upgrade. It launched a new series which was positioned in premiumsegment (RMB600-1000) in 4Q17 for
        Herborist and it has been well received.<br/><br/>
        According to Jahwa, ASP hike is the major driver for Herborist¡¯s growth in 2017.<br/><br/>
        To recap, the brand recorded double digit growth in 9M17 in department storechannel. In 2018, Herborist will
        launch high end colour cosmetics products. It willalso upgrade its basic series to attract the younger
        generation. For other brands,premiumization also remains as the key growth driver, e.g. Liushen. It will
        diversifythe flavours of Liushen and add more fragrance elements to de-emphasize itsseasonality.<br/><br/>
        Channel restructuring. Its channel restructuring in 2017 mainly focused onecommerce. Firstly, it transferred its
        Tmall supermarket and JD supermarketchannel from wholesales to direct-run in the middle of the year. Secondly,
        it triedto use ecommerce service provider to operate its Tmall flagship stores in 4Q17,which is the No.1 online
        channel for the company. This transition will be fully inplace in 2018. This business model adjustment is
        expected to optimize its onlinechannel in longer term. It might create some short-term hiccups like slower
        salesgrowth yoy but better profitability should be expected.<br/><br/>
        Excluding D&amp;A;, it targets to reduce its opex as % of sales to below 50% in longrun, from 60% of current
        level.<br/><br/>
