    <p> Maintaining FY17 guidance.<br/><br/>
        Management continues to guide RMB73bn revenue for 2017, on track to reachthe RMB100bn target by 2019. Net profit
        / core net profit excluding extraordinaryitems in 2017 likely have reached RMB1.3-1.4bn / RMB1.0bn,
        respectively. Majordrivers include expanding network coverage, increasing product offerings, andbetter DS
        penetration. Going forward, the company expects to reach core netprofit of RMB1.3bn in 2018, while RMB1.4bn
        might be possible.<br/><br/>
        Updates on DS / IDS and coverage.<br/><br/>
        Indirect sales (IDS) now accounts for 42% of total sales, down 2% from 44% inOctober 2017. Medical institutions,
        drug stores, non-drug channels account for29%, 22%, 6-7% of total revenue, respectively. Medical institution
        sales grew atabove 30% rate for 2016-2017, while drug store sales grew at 31-32% in 2017 vs.<br/><br/>
        15-16% in 2016 due to two-invoice. On coverage expansion, the company's corestrategy is to acquire local
        distributors. During 9m17, Jointown acquired over 40distributors, though 80 more are needed to reach target
        coverage at the nationallevel. On average, each acquired distributor was valued at RMB20-30m with
        overRMB200-300m revenue and net profit of RMB4-5m, while Jointown typicallyacquires up to 60% of interest only.
        In addition, each acquired asset undergoesa 3-year transition period, where operational and financial IT systems
        need tointegrate with Jointown's, though financial statements are not consolidated yet.<br/><br/>
        The practice would add some but not much profit growth to Jointown, as mostacquired assets were already clients,
        though volume typically will rise once ina cooperative relationship. As of now, Hubei / Henan / Beijing /
        Guangdongare Jointown's largest markets, with 2017 sales of RMB10bn/8-9bn/7bn/6bnrespectively.<br/><br/>
        Margins and other key takeaways.<br/><br/>
        On margins, sales to medical institutions typically lead to 7-8% GM, where tier2 and above are 9%, and below
        tier 2 have 7%. Chain drug stores typically have5-6% GM, and independent ones have a bit over 7%. Overall GM for
        Jointownis about 8% at present. The company is seeing worsening receivable days, onaverage about 10 days longer
        in 2017 compared to same period in 2016. For 2017,the major nonrecurring items were proceeds from land sales of
        a distributioncenter in Wuhan, estimated at RMB400m pre-tax and RMB360m after-tax.</p>
