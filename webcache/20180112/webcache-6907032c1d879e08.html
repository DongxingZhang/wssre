    <p> SAIC Motor attended our Access China conference on 10 January. The followingare the key takeaways from investor
        meetings:- SAIC expects China passenger vehicle (PV) sales volume to grow by about 3-4%YoY in 2018 and
        commercial vehicle (CV) to decline by 6-8% YoY. In total, Chinavehicle sales volume will grow 2-3% YoY in 2018.
        The company thinks ASP willcontinue to go up given mix improvement.<br/><br/>
        - SAIC expects the SUV segment to remain the growth driver and will make uphalf of total PV sales in the next
        2-3 years. To benefit from the faster growth, thecompany will launch more SUVs in FY18E, and expects SUV to
        account for atleast 30% of its total sales. Meanwhile, management thinks price competition inthe SUV segment
        will intensify, especially for low-end SUVs.<br/><br/>
        - SAIC sold 60k new energy vehicles (NEV) in 2017 and target to double that thisyear. To support this goal, the
        company will launch 7 NEV models, 4 of which willbe pure electric cars and 3 will be plug-in hybrids. SAIC will
        continue to be a localbrand leader in NEV technologies, such as for the battery management system,and will
        implement a flexible strategy in R&amp;D; while complying to the nationalstandard. Going forward, the company
        will also widen its battery supplier base.<br/><br/>
        - SAIC is one of the biggest auto financing groups in China. By 2020E, itsauto financing business will probably
        contribute c. RMB6.5bn net profit (FY16:RMB3bn). The company's auto finance business is mainly operated by
        twosubsidiaries, namely the 100%-owned SAIC Finance and the SAIC GMAC JV. Thetotal loan balance at yearend 2017
        is c. RMB200bn.<br/><br/>
        - SAIC sold 520k local brand vehicles and expects to sell 650k-700k units in2018. The gross profit margin of the
        local brand is around 20%. Excluding R&amp;D;,operating profit improved in 9M17. The company expects
        profitability to continueto improve going forward.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view.<br/><br/>
        In 2017, SAIC achieved 6.8% YoY vehicle sales growth. Going forward, weexpect SAIC Motor's sales momentum to be
        sustained with further product miximprovement. On a high base, we envision a stable earnings growth trajectory
        forthe company, which should support its generous dividend payout. We maintain Hold on SAIC Motor because we
        think the current valuation is fair. Key downsiderisks include: 1) a weak reception for its new models from
        various SAIC brands;2) pricing pressure amid industry competition; and 3) worse-than- expected localbrand
        profitability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-than- expected sales volumeand pricing; and 2)
        better-than-expected local brand profitability.</p>
