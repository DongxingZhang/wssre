    <p> News reports indicate Jio is reducing effective pricing by 10-20% on its plans<br/><br/>
        Under the ¡°Happy new year offer¡±, Jio would reduce plan pricing by Rs50orgive 50% more daily data allowance. The
        cut comes after two price increasessince April 2017when Jio went ¡°free-to-paid¡±. Please see table for the
        detailsof Jio¡¯s tariffs. There are some variation in among the news reports on theextent of the changes. We
        expect the pricing in the Indian telecom market toprogressively rationalize leading to a higher revenue table
        for the sector. Hencethe current price cut is a cause of concern. Jio has been calibrating its tariffsevery
        3-months, hence we would watch for next move which is likely aroundthe April/2018.<br/><br/>
        Incumbents have largely matched Jio¡¯s offers over the past 3-6months<br/><br/>
        Bharti, Idea and Vodafone have been calibrating their offers to Jio¡¯s pricing toretain their broadband
        subscriber base. While Jio has maintained subscriberadditions at around 6m/month, Bharti has also increased its
        broadband basefor past two quarters. Idea has grown its base in the last quarter. At the end of2QFY18(Sept), the
        broadband subscriber base for Jio (active subs)/Bharti/Ideastood at 105m/65.8m/29.6m.</p>
