    <p> A summary of recent regulations and monetary policy measures<br/><br/>
        The pace of releasing new regulations has accelerated notably. Three ruleswere unveiled by CBRC over the
        weekend. The direction is clearly on thetightening side: cracking down on shadow banking and reducing
        wholesalefunding. On the other hand, to hold the bottom line of no systemic risks, thePBOC has increased
        liquidity injections (by Rmb1.6tr in 2017, equivalent to110bps RRR cuts) and announced a few pre-emptive
        measures, e.g. atemporary RRR cut and relaxation in the automated pledging financing facility.As such, we expect
        financial deleveraging to continue but the process is likelyto be orderly, given the low risk of an
        uncontrollable ¡°liquidity event¡±.<br/><br/>
        Tighter regulations: closing loopholes, but being more coordinated<br/><br/>
        Since the first meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committeeon 8Nov 2017¨Cthe ¡°super-regulator¡±
        coordinating financial regulators¨Cthepace of releasing new regulations has accelerated notably (Fig. 2).
        Thisweekend, the CBRC released 3regulations targeting entrusted loans, banks¡¯concentration risks and
        shareholding management. These regulations, ingeneral, target a crack down on shadow banking by closing
        loopholes andreducing regulatory arbitrage. What makes this round of tightening differentfrom the past is that
        with the new committee leading, the regulations are morecoordinated and most have considerable grace periods.
        Starting with TheAsset Management Guideline (note), an overall guideline, the regulations aretargeting
        particular sub-markets/sectors one-by-one and step-by-step.<br/><br/>
        Monetary policy: higher rates but ample liquidity with pre-emptive measures<br/><br/>
        PBOC has hiked OMO rates 25bps in 2017; we expect another 20-45bps in2018, but liquidity vol. should stay ample,
        as we believe that, while tightening,PBOC also needs to prevent systemic risks. Indeed, in 2017, PBOC
        injectedRmb1.6tr liquidity mainly via MLF and PSL, equivalent in size to 100bps RRRcut or sufficient to fund 10%
        of banking asset expansion. Recent relaxation onautomated pledged financing suggests smaller banks in temporary
        liquiditytroubles should have access to bigger-amt funding provided by PBOC. Alsotemporary RRR cut during
        Chinese New Year may release Rmb1.5-2.0trliquidity for 1mo., which should smooth liquidity tightness by then. We
        expectrelatively remote likelihood of bank run in wholesale funding market.<br/><br/>
        Implications for the system and individual banks<br/><br/>
        Longer term, we see most deleveraging measures as necessary to strengthenChina¡¯s financial stability, generating
        net positive to financial system and realeconomy. Near term, for financial system, we expect slower banking
        assetgrowth, modest yield curve steepening &amp; lower actual risk-free rate. For realeconomy, we forecast
        moderate credit growth with shrinking shadow bankingand hence, slower economic growth. Yet, it should come with
        benefit ofslower build-up in leverage &amp; better transparency. Retail banks (big4/CMB/CRCB) should benefit
        from higher rates &amp; yield curve steepening due tosolid deposit franchises. Other smaller banks will
        experience ongoing fundingand capital pressure. Our order remains BOC/ABC/CCB/ICBC/CRCB/BoCom.Catalysts: better
        results, introduction of CCyB and D-SIB, apt. of governor ofnew committee and Southbound inflow.</p>
