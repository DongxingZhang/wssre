    <p> Steel equities continue to be volatile, driven by macro woes and commodity pricemovements. Although current spot
        conditions remain strong, we still expect costsupport to fade, and thus, European prices to fall (current spot
        conditions wouldimply further significant earnings upgrades across the space). Our top picks are:1)
        ArcelorMittal, which looks attractive to us based on strong cash flow (7-12%FCF yield), valuation and additional
        upside optionality; and 2) Voestalpine, whichwe believe has more room for upgrades, generates strong underlying
        CF (9-10%FCF yield) and has a less volatile business model.<br/><br/>
