    <p> We saw strong share price performance from HK and SG banks in 2017, withabsolute share price returns of 34% and
        38%, respectively, the best since 2009due to expectations of an improving earnings outlook with better NIMs in
        ahigher rates environment, non-interest income strength, stable asset qualitytrends and strong capital ratios.
        Heading into 2018, while most of thesecatalysts are known and partially priced in, we think SG banks still
        appearmore attractive than HK banks. UOB and the Dah Sings are our top picks.<br/><br/>
        Net interest margins: The margin trend favored HK banks more last year.<br/><br/>
        However, not all of the increase was driven by higher rates in HK.<br/><br/>
        Moreover, we believe margin upside in HK could be capped by new loancompetition and finally a pick-up in cost of
        funds. Rates transmissionshould stay low, with only NIM steadily improving for both systems.<br/><br/>
        Asset quality: Both banking systems seem sound in FY18, and we believethe rest of the SG banks could ¡°kitchen
        sink¡± vulnerable lending. As aresult of a stable macro environment, asset quality should stay at lowlevels
        despite IFRS9. However, for SG banks, as MAS no longer allows GPbuffering, we expect a lower level of GP going
        forward, hence improvingtheir RoAE. Given their existing higher level of GP buffer, the sector wouldalso be less
        affected by the longer-term negative implications of IFRS9.<br/><br/>
        Capital ratios: HK banks¡¯ higher capital ratios were boosted by their higherIRB model utilization, with the
        lowest risk weight density in the region. Thekey risk is that when the asset quality cycle worsens, RwA would
        move upat a much steeper pace, with higher EL/LGD estimation. Aside from that,capital consumption for the sector
        would be much greater in supportingmainland corporate expansions, while SG banks¡¯ domestic/retail marketfocus
        should leave more room for capital management going forward.<br/><br/>
        Wealth management (WM): While HK banks¡¯ lending growth shouldoutpace that of SG banks this year, most were
        corporate/Chinese SOEsdriven to where margins could stay low. WM should provide better upsidepotential, as it
        has less capital consumption and is positively geared to risingwealth in the region ¨C a segment that investors
        are willing to pay for at ahigher multiple. SG banks have a stronger momentum in the WM business,which will
        likely be a key catalyst. For details, please refer to our recentlypublished note on SG banks, ¡°Retail franchise
