        chips to power smart home and self-driving vehicles. UBTECH has aservice robot, Lynx, embedded with the Amazon
        Alexa service.<br/><br/>
        Drones: We expect to see more new drone designs and commercial dronemodels in the event, consistent with our
        view on the drone industry (link).<br/><br/>
        DJI will put the entry-level agriculture drone, Phantom 4 RTK (Real-TimeKinematic) for sale, with GPS accuracy
        improved to &lt;5cm vs standard drones¡¯500cm. SolarDrone is launching a solar-powered quadcopter (Fig
        3),extending the flight time from &lt;30mins to hours via lightweight solar panels.<br/><br/>
        Autonomous driving: Byton, backed by Hon Hai and Tencent, launches itsfirst EV, Concept (Figs 4-5), equipped
        with Level 3 autonomous driving initiallyand a 50-inch display as the center console. The model will be sold
        with astarting price at ~US$45k in China in 2019 and the US in 2020. Baiduintroduces Apollo 2.0, the open-source
        autonomous driving platform,allowing vehicles to drive autonomously on simple urban streets.<br/><br/>
        VR/AR: HTC will unveil a new VR device, Vive Pro, with higher resolution(2880x1600 dual OLED) to enable clearer
        text rendering and graphics.<br/><br/>

        Xloongwill launch new AR glasses. Goertek has been a strong manufacturingpartner with major VR/AR brands like PS
        VR, Oculus and Pico.<br/><br/>
        Semiconductors: We see China semi to be driven by auto electronics, IoT,mobile and infrastructure, with AI to be
        increasingly critical (link). Attendingsemi companies include ASE, MediaTek, Goodix, Realtek, Allwinner
        andHiSilicon, while MediaTek will announce NeuroPilot AI platform for edgecomputing, and launch several AI
        products such as smart display SoCssupporting AI vision and a 12nm SoC for 4K streaming Dongle.</p>
