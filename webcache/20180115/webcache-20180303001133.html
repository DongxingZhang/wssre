    <p> High investors interest on promising industrial growth.<br/><br/>
        Kstar is one of the largest uninterruptable power supply (UPS) brands in Chinaand is gaining QF investors'
        attention recently due to its (30% EPS CAGRin 2017-2020E) industrial growth on robust data center setup in
        China. Thecompany generates most of its UPS revenue from financial institutions (30-40%of UPS revenue),
        government agents, transportation infrastructure and IDC,which feature high entry barriers. Given its continued
        high-power UPS marketshare gain from international brands (Schneider), Kstar is confident of postingongoing
        market expansion from its current 35% level. Investors also like Kstar¡¯ssolid balance sheet (net cash, positive
        FCF) and promising EV charging growth;reiterating Buy.<br/><br/>
        Delivering 30% EPS CAGR in 2017-2020E on industrial growth (IDC UPS, EVcharging).<br/><br/>
        Kstar expects a 30% EPS CAGR in 2017-2020E driven by strong high-power(20kVA+) on-line UPS growth on IDC
        proliferation in China and robust EVcharging demand. Propelled by its continued R&amp;D; investment in premium
        UPSand the support from the Chinese government, Kstar keeps gaining sharefrom international UPS brands (eg.
        Schneider, Eaton) in China. Managementanticipates its market share will expand from 15-16% now to 20-25% in two
        years,which supports a 20%+ UPS revenue growth in both 2018E and 2019E. Kstarhas also begun to ship its
        integrated UPS (combining self-made high-precisionair conditioner UPS battery into a cabinet) to IDC customers,
        which carries a 40%GPM, given its increased value-added.<br/><br/>
        Kstar is confident of sustaining 35%+ GPM from UPS (despite rising raw materialcost) in the long-run due to
        continued product mix improvement (integrated UPS,large IDC).<br/><br/>
        Promising inverter + booming EV demand.<br/><br/>
        Kstar delivered a 100%+ YoY inverter revenue increase in 2017 due to its newpoverty reduction projects win from
        the government. Management indicatesthat the local government keeps building inverter stations in rural regions
        (eg.<br/><br/>
        hills), which is viewed as a long-term electric infrastructure investment with 3-5years order visibility.
        Therefore, Kstar guides a 30-40% inverter revenue CAGR in2017-2020. Kstar also enjoys strong EV charging demand
        in China by leveragingits power efficient charging pile (featuring 96-98% conversion efficiency ratio
        vs.<br/><br/>
        the industry average of 91-93%). The company¡¯s EV charging revenue ramped to RMB150m in 2017 vs. RMB70m in 2016.
        Management is confident of posting100%+ YoY EV revenue growth in 2018 given the strong orders forecast fromkey
        customers. Kstar is also developing a vehicle carry charger with auto OEMs(Brilliance BMW, according to
        management), which will support its long-term EVgrowth.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        Our target price of RMB21 is still based on 30x one-year FW EPS, in line withthe Asian cloud computing peer
        average. Risks: slower EV/UPS demand andunfavorable FX.</p>
