    <p> In the coming two weeks, the BoJ (January 23rd), the ECB (January 25th), and the Fed (January 31st) will all
        hold their first monetary policy meetings in 2018. The synchronized up-trend of global growth has already
        suggested that global monetary easing has approached its inflection point and monetary policies among major
        central banks will gradually converge, from easing to tightening, in the future. Recently, the BoJ¡¯s data on
        reduced government bond (JGB) purchases and the ECB¡¯s December meeting minutes showing stronger confidence on
        economic growth further fueled market expectations of faster pace of monetary tightening this year, boosted the
        value of euro and yen as well as bond yields. However, we still see a number of uncertainties regarding faster
        monetary tightening, mainly, the still subdued inflation. Thus, we expect all of the central banks to stand pat
        in January meetings, and the BoJ and the ECB could even adopt a somewhat dovish tone to gauge market
        expectations.<br/><br/>
        As we have addressed in our previous reports, supported by the robust labor market and the potential boosts from
        tax cut, the US has the biggest upside in economic growth, among developed economies. Thus, for now, we see that
        the Fed is the most likely to speed up its monetary tightening process in 2018, with more rate hikes. However,
        there are still several caveats: 1) inflation is only expected to gradually pick up, so the risk of overshooting
        is limited; 2) downside risk on economic growth could be a concern in 2H, as the mid-term elections would
        increase uncertainties; 3) Trump¡¯s tax reform and other fiscal stimulus plans suggest a widening fiscal deficit
        and higher government debt level; and a low-interest environment will be beneficial to the government. Thus,
        even under the most hawkish case, we do not expect to see the benchmark rates reach well above the upper bound
        of Fed prediction, i.e., 2.5% - 2.75%, or 5 rate hikes in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Secondly, for the ECB, we expect the ECB to stop QE purchases in September as its current plan ends, but rate
        hike this year still seems too early, mainly due to the notable slack in labor market and weak inflationary
        pressure. Specifically, the region¡¯s unemployment rate is still as high as around 9%, which constrains wage
        growth and inflation; HICP inflation was at 1.4% YoY in December, still well below ECB¡¯s target. Besides,
        political risks are still lingering: 1) after Merkel¡¯s failure of forming the Jamaica coalition, the grand
        coalition with SPD is now the only way to avoid a second election or a minority government; in case that it
        fails, Germany or even EU¡¯s future would be in risk; 2) the Italian election scheduled on March 4th could also
        pose some risk as the populist party, five star movement, led the poll, and we cannot rule out the odds that its
        possible victory could trigger another round of populism trend in Europe. Thus, for now, we do not expect the
        ECB to speed up its QE tapering, or hike the rates before the end date in September.<br/><br/>
        For Japan, although the economic recovery gained momentum and deflation concerns abated for now, neither the
        recovery nor the inflation has come close to the point that deserves an explicit monetary tightening. As we have
        addressed, BoJ¡¯s "QQE with Yield Curve Control (YCC)¡± enabled the central bank to make more flexible adjustments
        to its bond purchases; and what we see is a notable reduction of the net purchases in JGBs, without any formal
        announcement. The average monthly purchases of JGB reduced from JPY 6.6 trillion last year to 4.8 trillion this
        year, making the expected annual purchases falling from JPY 79 trillion last year to JPY 58 trillion. However,
        looking forward, we do not expect the BoJ to significantly tighten its policy as: 1) inflation is still very
        weak at around 0.5%; 2) a stronger yen could dampen export growth and risk the stability of Japan¡¯s export led
        growth.<br/><br/>
        In sum, we expect to see global growth and monetary policy converging in 2018, which would lead to more
        synchronized increase in interest rates and bond yields. Thus, although the US leads the tightening process,
        this convergence would limit the upside of the<br/><br/>
        dollar.</p>
