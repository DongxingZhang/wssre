    <p> Headlines suggesting Canadian trade representatives were increasinglyconvinced President Trump would shortly
        announce a unilateral US withdrawalfrom NAFTA triggered an MXN and CAD selloff. The headline and selloff
        weresomewhat surprising as sentiment regarding the future of NAFTA had picked upearlier in the week following
        comments by Mexican Economy Minister Guajardoseemingly opening the door to some negotiation regarding rules of
        origin inthe car industry. Also, President Trump¡¯s speech to the American Farm BureauFederation last Monday was
        unusually neutral regarding NAFTA as there was nomention of tearing up the agreement. A possible explanation for
        the anti-NAFTAtone perceived by Canadian officials was that the harsher stance on NAFTA wasretaliation against
        the complaint regarding U.S. trade practices filed by Canadaat the WTO a month ago but released earlier on
        Wednesday. Yet the White Housequickly released a public statement indicating that President Trump¡¯s stance
        onNAFTA had not changed which lead to both the CAD and MXN to recover roughlyhalf of their earlier loss relative
        to the USD. We expect the environment to remainnoisy for the MXN and Mexico risk in general because of trade
        issues. The sixthround of NAFTA negotiations is scheduled to begin on January 23rd in Montrealfollowed by
        seventh round in Mexico early in February. Unlike the previous round,this time USTR Lighthizer, Mexico¡¯s
        Minister Guajardo, and Canada¡¯s MinisterFreeland will all be in attendance in Montreal which leads us to expect
        a noisierenvironment in terms of headlines. Also, President Trump will deliver the State ofthe Union Address on
        January 30th which could also lead to a noisy environmentand thus a weaker MXN (see FX Blueprint ¨C Theme #12
