    <p> We expect Alibaba to report strong 3QFY18 results in early Feb, supported bysuccessful Single Day sales and
        sustained strength in user traffic. Weforecast 57% yoy revenue growth in 3QFY18 to Rmb83.8bn, attributable tothe
        consolidation of Cainiao and a robust China Retail which we project togrow 51% yoy to Rmb61.4bn. We foresee
        margin contraction from theconsolidation of Cainiao and drag from new retail and international
        business.<br/><br/>
        Our earnings forecasts remain largely unchanged. We roll-over our SOTPvaluation from FY18 to FY19, and raise our
        TP to US$259 from US$245.<br/><br/>
        Sustained strength in Tmall MAU and time spent. Our mobile traffic trackershows sustained strength in Alibaba¡¯s
        MAU and user time spent, albeit aslow-down in overall online retail sales growth. According to NBS data,
        onlineretail sales growth slowed to 23% yoy in Oct-Nov 2017 from 30% yoy in3Q17. Nonetheless, we observe
        acceleration in both mobile MAU and timespent on Alibaba¡¯s Tmall &amp; Taobao ¨C MAU/time spent growth increased
        from16%/17% yoy in Sep-17 to 20%/20% yoy in Nov-17, with Tmall¡¯s metricsgrowing faster than Taobao¡¯s.<br/><br/>
        Accelerating GMV growth on 11.11. Alibaba delivered another successfulSingles Day sales in 2017. With 140k
        brands participating in the Singles Dayevent, GMV on 11.11 increased 39% yoy to Rmb168bn, beating the
        market¡¯sexpectation of Rmb150bn. The GMV growth also represented an accelerationfrom 32% yoy in 2016.<br/><br/>
        57% yoy revenue growth in core commerce and cloud computing. Weforecast Alibaba¡¯s China Retail to increase 51%
        yoy to Rmb61.4bn, thanks tothe successful Singles Day promotion. We believe strong GMV and theconsolidation of
        Cainiao should support 57% yoy total revenue growth in3QFY18 to Rmb83.8bn. We expect Cloud Computing revenue to
        rise 95% yoyto Rmb3.4bn, with expansion in both the number of paying customers andARPU.<br/><br/>
        Margin contraction due to new business. We expect aggressivepromotions, the development of new retail including
        Intime and Hema, as wellas the consolidation of loss-making Cainiao to weigh on margins. We forecastGPM to
        decline 3ppts yoy to 61% and non-GAAP OPM to contract 6.5pptsyoy to 39% in the quarter.<br/><br/>
        We trim our FY18/19 EPS by 1% each on margin drag from new retaildevelopment and Cainiao consolidation. We
        roll-over our SOTP valuationfrom FY18 to FY19, and raise our TP to US$259 from US$245.<br/><br/>
        12-month price target: US$259.00 based on a Sum of Parts methodology.<br/><br/>
        Catalyst: New Retail and Global expansion.</p>
