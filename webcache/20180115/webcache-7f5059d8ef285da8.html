    <p> The Monetary Policy Council (MPC) decided to keep all the NBP rates unchangedat its January meeting. It left the
        reference rate, Lombard rate, deposit rate andrediscount rate at 1.50%, 2.50%, 0.50%, 1.75%,
        respectively.<br/><br/>
        With inflation having slowed sharply to 2%YoY in December after hitting the2.5% NBP target in the preceding
        month, the statement and press conferenceboth struck a fairly dovish tone. Forward-looking bits of the
        communique stillshowed that in the Council¡¯s opinion, favorable economic conditions in the Polisheconomy will
        continue in the next quarters, but GDP growth will decelerate fromlevels seen in H2 2017 (~4.6%YoY), while it
        judged that inflation will remain closeto the inflation target over the projection horizon. The MPC communicated
        thatthe current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy onthe sustainable growth path
        and maintaining macroeconomic stability.<br/><br/>
        Other parts of the press release were almost a carbon copy, except for a few minortweaks here and there to take
        latest macro and financial outturns into account.<br/><br/>
        As such, the Council still said core inflation - net of food and energy (0.9%YoY inNovember) - remains low while
        pointing to moderate headline inflation abroad.<br/><br/>
        The MPC highlighted higher commodity prices and wage growth of late; still therewas no direct reference to
        upside risks emanating from these on inflation outlookand (dovish) policy stance ahead.<br/><br/>
        During the presser, Governor Glapinski took every opportunity to talk down thepossibility of rate hike. First,
        he reiterated his long-term call for steady rates during2018 but this time he also said rate stability could
        linger into 2019. Second,he explicitly voiced his view that stronger zloty (by 4% from peak to trough inQ4 2017)
        would be a substitute for higher policy rates. Third, he reminded hisassessment that tight labor market and
        rising wage growth would not lead tohigher retail prices due to downward impact from globalization (on wages)
        andlarge enough labor force in Poland.<br/><br/>
        MPC member Gatnar, a moderate hawk in our ranking, voiced his surprise by thelarger-than-expected decline in
        flash December CPI, and revealed his preferenceto adopt a 'wait-and-see' approach until new macro projections
        arrive in March.<br/><br/>
        Jerzy Kropiwnicki, another MPC member present during the presser whom welabel as an in-betweener on our scale
        (i.e. neither a hawk or a dove), mentioned his assessment for absence of any meaningful upside risk from wage
        growth oninflation outlook.<br/><br/>
        Another interesting point of discussion was about the treatment of +/- 1percentage point fluctuation band around
        the 2.5% inflation target. Rate-setters- almost unanimously - stated deviation from the target in either
        direction (withinthe band) should be treated symmetrically. Taking into account absence of anypolicy reaction to
        CPI outturn during 2017 (i.e. all within 1.5-2.5% band), such aremark implicitly reveals the Council's
        inclination to not raise rates even if annualinflation fares somewhat above 2.5%.</p>
