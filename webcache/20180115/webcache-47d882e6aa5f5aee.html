    <p> Still needs more time before next price hike<br/><br/>
        Investors' questions focus on whether Wuliangye will raise its ex-factory prices.Management did not rule out the
        possibility of an increase in time, especiallyafter Moutai's price hike. However, it thinks that more time is
        needed, given thatchannel profit has only been stable for one year. The company's priority currentlyis to
        maintain channel profit margins and to strengthen the retail price stability.<br/><br/>
        Target 30% yoy sales growth in 2018<br/><br/>
        Management is confident it can reach its target. Key sales drivers will be: 1)mainstream Wuliangye to grow by
        18% from 17,000tons in 2017to 30,000tonsin 2018; 2) price increase through raising the portion of "out of plan"
        volume from10% in 2017to 50% in 2018, implying a 5% price increase; and 3) incrementalsales of mass market sub
        brands to RMB10bn in 2018¨C it targets to build upone sub brand with RMB2bn sales, and 2-3sub brands with RMB1bn
        sales bythe end of 2020.<br/><br/>
        To increase channel penetration through its "10thousand project"<br/><br/>
        Management aims to increase its penetration through a ¡°hundreds of cities,thousands of counties, and ten
        thousand stores¡± program. By the end of 2017,it had built up 7,000core POS and 1,000Wuliangye specialty stores.
        It targetsto increase to 8,000core POS and 1,500specialty stores in 2018. The channelexpansion will be a key
        driver for its 30% growth target. Meanwhile, throughinstalling IT systems at the retail end, the company will
        have stronger control inchannel inventory and better understanding of the market.<br/><br/>
        Our view: don't leave the party too early<br/><br/>
        We like Wuliangye for its lower risk in channel de-stocking, especially afterMoutai price increase and with the
        approach of Chinese New Year. We expect thecompany to enter a secular growth period in 2018-19, and its earnings
        to register29% CAGR in 2018-20E, driven by management¡¯s strong incentives for growthand expanding the high end
        liquor market after the increase in Moutai price. Wereiterate our Buy rating with TP of RMB98based on DCF
        approach. Downsiderisk: channel de-stocking in the high-end liquor sector; food safety; worse-thanexpectedmacro
