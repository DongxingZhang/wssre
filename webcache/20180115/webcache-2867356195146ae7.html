    <p> Investment highlights: ST positive on cyclicals, LT positive on growth stocks Sectorfundamentals offered quite a
        few positive surprises in 2017, and we maintain a positiveoutlook on fundamentals in 2018. In terms of
        investment strategies, better-than-expectedfundamentals brought investment opportunities in 2017 (mainly in
        subsector leaders andcyclical stocks). Based on our expectations of sector fundamentals, we remain upbeatabout
        investing in the sector in 2018, with opportunities likely to come from three areas.<br/><br/>
        Firstly, we think Nov 2017 to 1Q18 is a period when market expectations are likely tocatch up with the
        fundamentals of cyclical companies. We like Huaxin Cement (600801CH) and Anhui Conch (600585 CH), and also
        suggest watching Wannianqing Cement(000789 CH); we also highlight upcoming supply-side changes in the glass
        industry withleader Kibing Group (601636 CH) likely to offer opportunities.<br/><br/>
        Secondly, subsector leaders which posted a strong run in share price in 2017 should stilldemonstrate steady
        share price growth in 2018 if they have strong fundamentals andattractive valuations. We like Oriental Yuhong
        (002271 CH), China Jushi (600176 CH),Beijing New Building Materials (000786 CH) and Sinoma Science &amp;
        Technology (002080CH).<br/><br/>
        Thirdly, we are positive on excess returns from quality growth stocks in 2018. Weparticularly like Pacific
        Quartz (603688 CH), Monarch Sanitary Ware (002798 CH),SKSHU Paint (603737 CH), TB New Decoration Material
        (002043 CH), ChanghaiComposite Materials (300196 CH) and Triumph Science &amp; technology (600552 CH), whilealso
        highlighting Zaisheng Technology (603601 CH).<br/><br/>
        Main theme of building materials sector in 2017: fundamentals stronger thanexpected Firstly, the prices of
        cement and glass exceeded expectations. The nationalaverage cement price had risen 63% from the beginning of
        2016 to Dec 10, 2017, whilethe national average price of glass had risen 35%, both exceeding
        expectations.<br/><br/>
        Secondly, industry leaders such as Anhui Conch (600585 CH), Kibing Group (601636CH), Beijing New Building
        Materials (000786 CH), Oriental Yuhong (002271 CH) andChina Jushi (600176 CH) posted much stronger-than-expected
        earnings growth in 9M17.<br/><br/>
        Short- and mid-term factors behind stronger-than-expected growth andimplications for 2018 In terms of short-term
        factors, with infrastructure demandremaining stable, the duration of property market strength and supply
        contractions beatexpectations. The most recent property market upcycle (29 months long from April 2015to Aug
        2017) was the longest of the three since 2009. In addition, production cuts was akey factor at play in the
        sector last year with a focus on rotational production halts andenvironmental inspections.<br/><br/>
        In terms of mid-term factors, the sector showed strong resilience and industryconcentration was rising with
        leading players remaining strong. Since 2012, the buildingmaterials sector has been in a process of deleveraging
        and de-capacity with a decreasingdebt-to-asset ratio and LT debt to total asset ratio and decelerating growth in
        fixed assets+ projects under construction. The turnover in fixed assets + projects under construction(i.e.
        capacity utilization) in 3Q17 rose to the highest level since 2009. Based on conditionsin both asset-heavy and
        asset-light industries over the past few years, rising industryconsolidation and leading players¡¯ consolidating
        strength tend to be two phenomena thatfortify each other.</p>
