        JD.com (Not covered, last close: USD46.1).<br/><br/>
        We felt JD spent more time focusing on the mid-term picture than the short term,highlighting apparel and
        FMCG/fresh food segment as area of growth in 2018.<br/><br/>
        4Q17 could mark the worst season for apparel in their view. Organic recovery ofapparel merchant appears to be a
        gradual process and we received impressionthat company expected progress in 2H18 than in 1H. For FMCG, JD felt
        it was onmore equal footing with key online competitors and that its strength in logisticsand partnership with
        Yonghui would add to its core competency in gaining sharein FMCG segment. On margins, JD aimed for 2%~4%
        non-GAAP net margin on1P and 1%~2% of GMV for 3P in the long-term.<br/><br/>
        Vipshop (Not covered, last close: USD13.6).<br/><br/>
        Timing-wise, Vipshop felt the partnership between Tencent/JD/Vipshop wasformed now as the differing parties were
        able to reach a consensus on the needto cooperate with one another. As part of that, Vipshop believed it would
        be in aposition to reap meaningful portion of the benefits accruing from the partnershipas traffic is directed
        its way. Cost wise, Vipshop plans to reduce its user acquisitioncost by lowering allocation to existing channels
        and use the incremental to giveto JD as its share of GMV for channeling traffic. Traffic acquisition had runup
        to RMB100 from 50-60 historically; while acquisition cost may not declineimmediately, company expected to see
        benefits to user acquisition cost over themid term. Overall aim was to maintain blended margins in 2018. In a
        separatesession by Questmobile on its research into D12 promotions, we noted QM datashowed the lowest conversion
        rate from product page to order page for Vipshopamong e-commerce players.<br/><br/>
        Rapid rise of social commerce.<br/><br/>
        An area of active discussion was the rise of social commerce, particularly in 2H17,with Pinduoduo (ranked #3
        e-commerce player in MAU terms by Questmobile) highlighted as the success case in tapping into rising e-commerce
        demandby lower-tier city consumers and doing so successfully through social mediachannels such as WeChat
        mini-program. Average basket size is believed to bemeaningfully low as of now and none of the existing larger
        e-commerce playerssaw the social e-commerce players as meaningfully threatening as of yet.<br/><br/>
        Baozun (Hold).<br/><br/>
        Baozun overall sounded very confident for 4Q17 sales growth despite ecommerceindustry seasonal slow-down.
        Blended take rate has been increasingfor both existing brands and new brands within the same category and
        samebusiness model. GMV mix, however, should continue to shift towards lowertake rate category in 2018, given
        smartphone brands are growing very fast(e.g. Huawei). The company maintained 2018 GMV growth guidance of 50%+.
        New brands in the pipeline focuses on high take rate category (e.g. appareland cosmetics), and will likely see
        10-20 brands addition each year. Baozunreiterated its IT capability and warehousing are two advantages over
        peers,enabling a one-stop solution to brand partners. International brands, who havemultiple e-commerce platform
        stores, therefore face high switching cost. Baozunacknowledged that some small brands have terminated contract
        in the past andswitched to cheaper Taobao partners, yet total GMV contribution is less than1%. The company
        expects some margin improvement in the future driven bythe operating leverage, and is dedicated to continue to
        improve the model mix,category mix and to create value-added services.</p>
