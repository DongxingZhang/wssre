    <p> We received many questions today following the apparent panic sale of cementstocks after the RMB120-170/t cut in
        clinker prices in YZD. The cut presents whatwe see as a very attractive opportunity to accumulate cement stocks.
        First, thecut did not come as a surprise to us and was also flagged by Conch during DB'sAccess China conference
        on Jan 9 (takeaways published on Jan 11, 2018). Stocksonly fell today as it was widely reported on social media.
        Second, the clinkerprice cut was only for specific regions close to rivers/ports and not across all ofChina. The
        rationale for the cut was to stem clinker imports from Vietnam as weenter the slow season, so that Vietnam
        clinker doesn't gain further market share.<br/><br/>
        Seasonally speaking, there are always price cuts in the slow season of CNY, soin our view, this event is really
        more of an 'excuse' to take profits after the strongrun in the cement sector.<br/><br/>
        For the first time in many years, China has become a net importer instead of anexporter in clinker, reflecting
        the shortage that has arisen as a result of the peakshifting production halts. Vietnam clinker imports reached
        400kt in Dec, which istiny versus the monthly consumption across the Eastern China provinces. Theseimports are
        also undertaken by small grinding stations after Conch and CNBMreduced external sales of clinker to these
        non-competitive lines. By Dec, Chinaclinker prices reached as high as RMB500/t, which gave room to Vietnam
        clinkerarriving in China at c.RMB400/t. At RMB500/t, clinker was more expensive thanlow-grade cement prices of
        RMB493/t, in YZD - or "flour" was more expensivethan "bread". This strategy is used to squeeze out small
        grinding stations.</p>
