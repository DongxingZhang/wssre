    <p> Anticipate stable delivery in 2018; Hengrui/SBP guided growth acceleration.<br/><br/>
        We hosted executives from 18 listed companies during the DB conferenceand tour this week. Most executives remain
        constructive for 2018 and, despitethe stock rally, have not become more bullish or bearish vs. 1H17.
        Additionaltakeaways: 1) most expect an acceleration of drug approvals and benefits fromNRDL inclusion, although
        their views on the exact timeline of the latter weremixed; 2) their expectations of the pricing/volume trends
        after BE were mixed.<br/><br/>
        We highlight that only two companies guided a growth acceleration for 2018 vs.<br/><br/>
        2017 ¨C Hengrui and Sino Biopharm.<br/><br/>
        DB proprietary executive survey on the 2018 outlook.<br/><br/>
        We conducted our annual survey of executives from 16 listed companies to gaugeviews of key policies and sector
        catalysts. We highlight the following results: 1)on whether the executives have changed their views on the
        sector growth outlookin 2018 vs. 1H17, 37% indicated no change. We concur and remind investors thatthe
        fundamentals have not changed despite the significant stock rally; 2) on thegrowth outlook for the distribution
        sector, 2 distributor bellwethers voted 7-8%,one expected a high single digit and another said 6-7%, vs. 7.8%
        growth in 1H17;3) on the timeline of the NRDL benefit on drug growth, the feedback was mixed,with 25% being
        uncertain; 4) on an acceleration of regulatory approvals in 2018,56% of the executives expected one; 5) on the
        pricing trend after the BE study,the responses were mixed as well, with 25% anticipating a price erosion and
        44%expecting stable prices.<br/><br/>
        DB view: more challenging to identify delta vs. consensus estimates.<br/><br/>
        From a valuation perspective, we believe most of the near-term catalysts havebeen reflected for large-cap stocks
        while new mid/long-term risks are likely toemerge. On fundamentals, while we could still identify meaningful
        differencesin selective mid/long term growth drivers on a qualitative basis, we see feweropportunities for
        consensus revisions of 2018 numbers. While it would bechallenging to predict the sustainability of a large-cap
        stock rally, we now believelaggards may have more chances to outperform. We highlight Jointown andUniversal
        Medical as our top picks. We also like IHH at this point.<br/><br/>
