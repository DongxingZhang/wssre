    <p> Positive growth outlook, but fairly priced<br/><br/>
        O-Film attended our DB Access China conference in Beijing. O-Film elaborateon key growth drivers in 2018,
        including the breakthrough in high-end dualcam projects (for Chinese OEMs), rising Apple sales (Touch panel ITO
        film andRX module in Face ID system) and potential 3D sensing module projects fromChinese OEMs. O-Film expects
        to see small volume adoption of 3D sensing in2H18, before a bigger ramp in 2019. For longer term, O-Film will
        focus onsmart vehicle solution (ADAS, entertainment system). Trading at 26x PER (or0.8x PEG), we think it is
        fairly priced, despite the decent growth. Hold.<br/><br/>
        CCM ¨C breakthrough in high-end dual cam projects<br/><br/>
        O-Film views dual-cam as the key growth driver in CCM business, believing itwill benefit from rising dual-cam
        penetration in China smartphones (from sub-20% to 30%-40%) and its share gain in high-end projects. O-Film has
        builtmonthly capacity of 15mn for dual-cam CCM now and expects to double thisby end of 2018(while single-cam CCM
        capacity could stay flat at 60-65mnunits). For high-end projects, O-Film highlights that it had grown its share
        inHuawei's high-end products (P/Mate series) from almost nil in 1H17to 10-15%in 2H17. Based on current order
        visibility, O-Film think it could get 30%+ or40%+ market share in new projects. Particularly, O-Film believe it
        will be thekey supplier for the globe's first trio-cam project (Huawei P20Pro, in our view).<br/><br/>
        3D sensing ¨C iPhone's RX module + initial adoption from Chinese OEMs<br/><br/>
        O-Film targets to get RX (receiver) module of iPhone's Face ID system in 2H18,by leveraging its current iPhone
        front-cam capacity. The design and structureof RX module is familiar to that of front cam. Face ID adoption is
        expected tospread out from iPhone X to all new iPhones in 2H18, so Apple will need moresuppliers. O-Film expects
        some Chinese clients to adopt 3D sensing module onfew very high-end models, but also notes the volume will be
        very small, giventhe immature technologies and low production yield. O-Film believes this willbe an important
        long-term growth driver, and has formed an exclusivepartnership with Mantis Vision (a leading 3D sensing
        algorithm supplier) totarget Chinese OEMs. Other partners include Himax in WLO lens and Finisar
        inVCSEL.<br/><br/>
        Apple's touch panel (TP) business ¨C expanding from iPad to iPhone<br/><br/>
        O-Film expects Android's TP business to stay stable, with the rising adoption ofout-cell solution to offset the
        continued pricing pressure. But, O-Film is positiveabout i-device's TP business. The firm just penetrated into
        iPad's TP sensor +full lamination business in May 2017, and has quickly grown market sharefrom zero to 20%-30%
        by the end of 2017. In 2018, O-Film expects it willcontinue to grow market share in iPad Tps, and is very likely
        to win iPhone TPorders as well (touch sensor + 3D touch + cover glass lamination).</p>
