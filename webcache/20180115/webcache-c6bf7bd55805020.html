    <p> Oil prices rally to best levels in 2? years.<br/><br/>
        Brent crude oil prices rallied to their best levels in 2? years at US$68/barrel on theback of (i) near-record
        heating demand in the US, fueled by a massive winter stormdescribed as a ¡®bombogenesis¡¯ or a ¡®bomb cyclone,¡¯
        (ii) OPEC/non-OPEC¡¯s extensionof 1.8mn bpd production cuts through the end of 2018, and (iii)
        anti-governmentprotests in Iran, OPEC¡¯s third largest crude producer, putting geopolitical risks that
        fuelconcerns about the stability of oil supplies back on the crude oil agenda. However, inthe long run, growing
        US output could possibly undermine OPEC¡¯s efforts to rebalancethe oil market and put oil prices back under
        pressure after oil production in the US isexpected to rise by around 0.7mn bpd from a year earlier to 9.92mn bpd
        in 2018 assoaring oil prices encourage US producers to bring more rigs online. To reflect therecent strong rally
        in oil prices, we have ratcheted up our Brent and Dubai crude oilprice assumptions for 2018 to US$61/barrel and
        US$58/barrel from the previousestimates of US$59/barrel and US$56/barrel respectively.<br/><br/>
        Refining margins likely to stay high amid tighter supply.<br/><br/>
        Refining margins are likely to stay high at the US$7/barrel level in 2018 on tightersupply after global
        incremental oil demand is poised to outpace new refining capacityadditions and China¡¯s exports of refined
        products are expected to grow at a modestpace due to the Chinese government¡¯s efforts to crack down on pollution
        and offloadexcess output.<br/><br/>
        Petrochemical spreads seen lower but still high compared to 4-year historicalaverages.<br/><br/>
        Even though the big picture for petrochemical spreads looks weak on growing supplyin 2018, the figures are
        likely to stay high compared to their 4-year historical averages.<br/><br/>
        Aromatics margins are expected to be softer than the level seen in 2017 amid risingsupply following the startup
        of new aromatics plants in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. PXnaphthaspreads are likely to stay level with the average
        level of 2017 driven bycontinued strong demand from the downstream PTA sector in China and India whileBZ-naphtha
        spreads may be dragged by a high base effect from 2017 when spreadsreceived a boost from exceptionally high
        levels of downstream SM prices. On the otherhand, olefins margins tend to hold steady as PE prices are expected
        to remain strongat around US$1,200/ton on expectations that the PE market will be in balance asgrowing US
        exports of PE should be offset by rising demand from Asia, notably Chinadue to the Chinese government¡¯s ban on
        waste plastic imports to curb domestic plasticrecycling.<br/><br/>
        ¡®NEUTRAL¡¯ position in energy space, ¡®OVERWEIGHT¡¯ stance on petrochemicals.<br/><br/>
        The rosier-than-expected earnings outlook lifted by higher product prices in the wake ofrising oil prices gives
        us an excuse to make sector-wide target price upgrades for bothenergy and petrochemical sectors. We hold a
        ¡®NEUTRAL¡¯ position in the energy spaceand reiterate an ¡®OVERWEIGHT¡¯ stance on the petrochemical sector. We also
        highlightPTT and PTTGC as our top picks in the energy and petrochemical sectors respectivelyas both now offer
        the highest upside among others.</p>
