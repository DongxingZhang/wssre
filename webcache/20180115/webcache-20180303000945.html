    <p> We invited Mr. Chen Ran, Deputy General Manager of Gongkong (a well-knownthird-party consulting firm
        specializing in China¡¯s IA market) to be present at ourAccess China Conference 2018on 10January in Beijing. We
        summarize belowour key takeaways:<br/><br/>
        2017ended on a strong note; 4Q beats expectations<br/><br/>
        Preliminary data from Gongkong shows that China¡¯s IA market demand was up15-16% YoY, with strong growth in 3Q
        sustained in 4Q. Such robust demand, inour view, beats expectations as the market previously expected 4Q growth
        to slowdown on high comparison base. Also, Gongkong noted that due to already betterthan-expected order intakes
        in 9M17, some industry players intentionally pushedsome 4Q orders to 2018, leaving enough room for growth in the
        coming quarters.Therefore, strong demand growth will likely be sustained at least in 1H18.<br/><br/>
        Demand driver has shifted to industry upgrade...Gongkong believes the key drivers for the strong IA demand in
        2017include: 1)industry upgrades in low-to-mid-end manufacturing sectors; 2) rising labor costs;and 3)
        improvement in end-customers¡¯ profitability. In the past, new capacityexpansion used to be the key driver for
        China¡¯s IA demand but now industryupgrade has become and will continue to be the predominant driver.<br/><br/>
        ...which means it¡¯s structural and the cycle may last longerAlthough China introduced automation products
        30years ago, the realautomation upgrade cycle in fact only started since 2014. Experiences fromdeveloped
        countries suggest it typically takes 10-15years to complete anautomation upgrade cycle but in China the cycle
        may last longer. This is mainlybecause China has a much more diversified and complicated manufacturingsector
        compared to most of the other developed economies. For example,automobile and electronic manufacturing, the two
        dominant verticals for IAdemand in other developed countries, only drive 30-40% of China¡¯s total IAdemand.
        Sectors like textile machinery, metallurgy, public facilities, etc. used tobe China¡¯s manufacturing foundation
        and they will lead this round of automationupgrade. In fact, such a trend is really taking place in these
        verticals.</p>
