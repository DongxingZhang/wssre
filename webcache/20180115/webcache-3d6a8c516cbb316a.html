    <p> There have been numerous reports (Bloomberg, January 8, 2018) that PresidentZuma may be asked to step down in
        the coming weeks if not days. Unconfirmedreports (Bloomberg, January 8, 2018) initially suggested, but were
        subsequentlydenied, that recalling President Zuma may be on the agenda of the NationalExecutive Committee (NEC)
        meeting on January 10. However, events over theweekend suggest that negotiations are far from over.<br/><br/>
        Elected president of the ANC, Ramaphosa moved quickly to shore-up support. Hevisited Zulu King Goodwill
        Zwelithini at his palace in Nongoma, northern KwaZulu-Natal, traditionally a stronghold of President Zuma¡¯s
        camp, and commentedpositively on land reform, reaching out to left-leaning voters.<br/><br/>
        Zuma, in his capacity as president of the country, met with a group of Zulusupporters who organized a
        #HandsoffZuma march. Traditionally, much of thesupport for ANC has come from KwaZulu-Natal. However, none of the
        candidatesfrom KwaZulu-Natal managed to make it to the top 6 of the ANC.<br/><br/>
        Should Ramaphosa take over as the president of the country, a cabinet re-shufflewould have to follow shortly
        after and likely ahead of the February 21 budgetannouncement. President of the country does not need support of
        the NationalAssembly for a government reshuffle.<br/><br/>
        Uncertainty remains regarding the impact of the Presidential Fiscal Committee(PFC). The PFC was set up in
        September 2017 at of the Extended Cabinet annualmeeting that the President convenes ahead of the Medium Term
        Budget PolicyStatement. The role of the PFC is to expedite politically challenging decisions,however, some
        rating agencies raised concerns about lack of transparency.<br/><br/>
        Markets are likely to view a recall of President Zuma as highly positive(Bloomberg, January 8, 2018). Ramaphosa
        is widely perceived to be morereform friendly and a government headed by him would be expected to deliveron
        structural reforms leading to improved business sentiment and strongergrowth. Should the government deliver a
        promising budget in February, furtherdowngrades by credit ratings agencies could be avoided.</p>
