    <p> Banks recapitalisation plan gathers pace<br/><br/>
        Although capital infusion plans were drawn very recently, the Governmentappears to be keen on implementing the
        recapitalisation before the newbudget announcement slated for February 2018. News [Bloomberg, LiveMint]suggests
        that the Finance Ministry is likely to issue the first tranche ofrecapitalisation bonds worth INR800bn to public
        sector banks (PSB) later thismonth once it receives approval from the lower house of parliament for anadditional
        increase in FY17/18budget. The request for this additional increaseis pending in the upper house. A total of
        INR2.1trn of recapitalisation will takeplace in the next two years of which INR1,35trn - by issuing special
        bonds.<br/><br/>
        Which banks should benefit from the first batch of special ¡°recap¡± bonds?<br/><br/>
        We believe that there is a high likelihood that the Government would uplift thepresent capitalisation of all
        PSBs - big or small, but it would be selective interms of allocation proportions. As we noted in our recent trip
        notes fromIndia, all PSBs require significant ramping up of their NPL provisions, whichultimately will offset
        the positive impact on banks¡¯ equity from recapitalisation.As the government is projecting ~100bp increase in
        GDP growth rates nextfiscal year, it may allocate a larger proportion of the first batch of recap bondsto banks
        with greater NPL provisioning coverage vis-¨¤-vis capital adequacy asthese banks would be able to channel more of
        allocated capital into loans andpropel economic activity. Those with poorer NPL coverage and those on RBI¡¯sPCA
        list, are likely to get the bare minimums allowing them meet Basel IIInorms. Scanning PSBs credit metrics we
        believe that SBI, Baroda, Canara andUnion banks would be the biggest net beneficiaries of the first batch of
        specialbonds allocation as a share of their existing capital.<br/><br/>
        Is pending recapitalisation an elixir for Indian PSBs?<br/><br/>
        We remain advocates of the view that a true success of this recapitalisationprogramme should be measured by the
        level to which the banks would be ableto increase their bad loans coverage with reserves while increasing Basel
        IIIcapital ratios. According to our estimates, PSBs would need ~USD16-17bn justto bring their LLRs to at least
        75% (assuming zero loan growth), whichaccounts for half of the total government recap package.<br/><br/>
        Tight valuations leave no scope for outperformance, but technicals are strong<br/><br/>
        There is nothing new in the observation of Indian banks bonds trading flat andeven tighter to bonds of better
        rated regional peers ¨C Canara Bank trading flatto CITIC Bank, SBI Snr flat to even shorter-dated BOCOM bonds,
        while SBI AT1stands out as the biggest outperformer in the Asian sub-debt space nowtrading ~40bp tighter vs.
        Woori c21and ~65bp tighter vs. BEA c22YTC-wise.In our view, the technicals for Indian bank bonds would remain
        universallystrong until we see the results of the first recap batch utilisation by relevantinstitutions. We
        change our Sell recommendations on Canara 22s (99.4/113bp),IDBI 4.125% 20s (101.25/155bp) and SBI
        AT1(105.15/182bp) ask-price/Gspr toHold. As a result, we upgrade our call on Indian banks space to Neutral.</p>
