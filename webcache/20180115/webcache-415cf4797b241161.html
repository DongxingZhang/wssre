    <p> Tight today, still long tomorrow but the balance point is coming in hard.<br/><br/>
        Writing in early October we commented that against a backcloth of strong 10% plus LNG demand growth basin price
        differentials were blowing out. Three months on and markets have proven even tighter than anticipated, the
        obvious implication being that Shell and to a lesser extent Total should see good income in Q4 '17 and Q1'18.
        Looking forward our view remains that now emerging supply will pressure spot prices through 2020. Yet with
        European growth healthy, China booming and limited investment decisions since 2014 our analysis says the period
        of excess is rapidly shortening thereby positioning the contract price cycle for upward momentum. Buy exposure.
        Buy Shell.<br/><br/>
        The charts paint a near and long term picture .<br/><br/>
        Ok, we are talking gas markets. Demand is both price sensitive and difficult to predict. But the charts paint an
        obvious near and longer term picture. Gas demand has been strong, price has rallied strongly and medium term
        market length is coming in. The consequence? A potential near term windfall for the major LNG marketers (read
        Shell and to a lesser extent Total) and a much better outlook for supply/demand balance. All told, a global gas
        market that looked at risk of oversupply post 2023 now looks positioned for 2022 deficit.</p>
