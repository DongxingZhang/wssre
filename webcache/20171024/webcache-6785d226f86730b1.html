    <p> Slow start, but picking up strongly afterwards.<br/><br/>
        Visitor arrivals were weak during Oct 1-4, recording YoY decline of2.0%/5.1% for overall/mainland visitors. Oct
        4 was mid-autumn festivalholiday when many might choose to stay with family. However, holidaytraffic recovered
        and cumulative visitor arrivals showed a strong pick-up to10.3%/11.0% for the entire Oct 1-8 holiday season. We
        think Oct GoldenWeek had a satisfactory performance and delivered stronger YoY growththan in CNY, despite the
        previous concern that longer holiday might pushoutbound tourists to farther destinations.<br/><br/>
        Solid fundamentals.<br/><br/>
        We expect October¡¯s GGR growth to slow down due to hiking base effectof VIP segment from 4Q16. However, we are
        ahead of solid earningsseason for Macau gaming, which might keep market expectation high:3Q17 GGR grew 22% YoY,
        7% QoQ, while opex should remain broadly flatQoQ. Thus, we are likely to see a nice QoQ property EBITDA
        growthoverall.<br/><br/>
        Any weakness to create a good entry point.<br/><br/>
        The sector is currently trading at 24x FY18E P/E and 15x EV/EBITDA, 0-10% higher than their 5-year averages.
        After a strong rally in Sep, we mightsee some profit-taking after the Golden Week, which we believe is a
        goodopportunity to accumulate ahead of results season. While Sands China andGalaxy continue to be our top picks,
        Melco Resorts (US ADR to captureHK-gaming stocks¡¯ rally) is likely to outperform on its attractive valuation.
