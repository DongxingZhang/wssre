    <p> Acquiring PWM¡¯s biomat businessin an all-share deal.<br/><br/>
        On 12 Oct, CBPOannounced that it will acquire 80% of PW Medtech¡¯s biomaterial business, TianXinfu. Tianxinfu is
        a maker of dura materfrom highly pure collagen, withthe largest Chinese market shareof c.37% in 2014. It
        reportedRMB247m revenue and RMB151m net profit(before M&amp;A; related intangible amortization)in 2016. We
        estimate that TianXinFushould grow itsnet profit at c.20%in RMBin 2017-18E. In exchange, CBPOwill issue 5.5m new
        shares to PW Medtech.Company justified this deal mainly onthe potential sales synergy between TianXinFu and
        CBPO-TianXinFu taps into c.1,600 hospitals mainly with its own salesteam, which can be utilized to promote
        CBPO¡¯s PCC,human fibrinogenand fibrin sealant. We however caveat that these sales reps may need to be retrained
        to promote plasma-derived products, and those products with synergy should represent&lt;4% of CBPO¡¯s 2018E
        revenue.<br/><br/>
        Enteringthe human fibrinogenmarket.<br/><br/>
        Previously, CBPO obtained the CFDA¡¯s approval to launch human fibrinogen, entering this c.RMB700m market
        inChina. There are only7 current playersin the market.We estimate that CBPO¡¯s product should take c.8% of the
        market share. Since the 2015 deregulation, the human fibrinogen prices more than doubled owing to limited supply
        and strong demand. We estimate that the product would contribute RMB41m/RMB21m to FY18E revenue/net profit
        (Figure 3).<br/><br/>
        TP cut to US$104.3on valuation methodchange.<br/><br/>
        Given the change in business scope (now integrating medical devices), we changed our valuation methodology from
        DCF to a sum-of-parts method: we apply 20x 2018E NOPAT for its plasma related portfolio, and 18x NOPAT for PPI
        and Biomat, and add back net cash and investments to arrive at the equity value. We maintain BUY on Company's
        low valuation (15x 2018E PER on our lowered EPS) and still strong exposure to plasma-derived products.</p>
