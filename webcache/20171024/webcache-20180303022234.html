    <p> We believe Sunny Optical will continue to increase its net profit in 2017 on the back ofits strong technological
        advantage. Given its recent higher-than-expected shipmentvolume, we revise up our diluted EPS forecasts from
        Rmb2.52 to Rmb2.61 in 17E(+123.1% YoY), from Rmb3.73 to Rmb4.04 in 18E (+54.8% YoY), and from Rmb4.74 toRmb6.00
        in 19E (+48.5% YoY). Our 18E EPS forecast is 20% higher than marketconsensus. We lift our target price from
        HK$130 to HK$145, representing 30x 18E PE.<br/><br/>
        With 29% upside, we maintain our BUY recommendation.<br/><br/>
        Optical upgrade. We believe the company¡¯s solid performance this year was mainlydriven by its growing
        dual-camera penetration rate. We now expect monthly moduleshipments to be in line with market expectations. We
        forecast the firm¡¯s product mix tocontinue to improve, and its dual-camera modules to account for 30% of
        shipments in2H17E. Meanwhile, the increasing adoption of dual-camera designs by Chinesesmartphone original
        equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on their mid-range smartphonemodels will provide further growth potential. Given
        Sunny¡¯s strong competitive edge in3D sensor module making, we forecast sales of 3D sensor modules will reach 10m
        unitsin 18E. We believe the increasing adoption of the 3D sensor technology will also providegrowth potential as
        Apple (AAPL:US) continues to upgrade its 3D sensors and androidbasedsmartphone makers follow the
        trend.<br/><br/>
        Lens beat. We believe that the market underestimates Sunny¡¯s future lens growthpotential. Looking at the handset
        lens business, we note the company has alreadyshipped its first hybrid lenses to clients. We think Sunny will
        continue to gain marketshare in coming years, on the back of its technological advantage. Meanwhile, thegrowing
        adoption of 3D sensors increases demand for lenses. We expect camera lensshipments to climb 35% YoY in 18E and
        25% YoY in 19E. As for the vehicle lenssegment, we highlight Sunny¡¯s dominant market position and expect
        shipments to growfurther in the next two years. We forecast vehicle lens shipments to grow 75% YoY in18E and
        expect its average selling price (ASP) and gross margin to improve.<br/><br/>
        Maintain BUY. We revise up our diluted EPS forecasts from Rmb2.52 to Rmb2.61 in 17E(+123.1% YoY), from Rmb3.73
        to Rmb4.04 in 18E (+54.8% YoY), and from Rmb4.74 toRmb6.00 in 19E (+48.5% YoY). Our 18E EPS forecast is 20%
        higher than marketconsensus. The stock is trading at 24x 18E PE and 10x 18E PB. We lift our target pricefrom
        HK$130 to HK$145, representing 30x 18E PE. With 29% upside, we maintain ourBUY recommendation.</p>
