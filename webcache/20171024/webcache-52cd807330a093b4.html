    <p> As expected, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) kept the slope of theSingapore dollar nominal effective
        exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band at zeropercent, with no change to the width of the policy band or the level
        at which itwas centred.<br/><br/>
        The MAS assessed it would be appropriate to maintain its neutral stance, amidbenign inflationary environment. In
        particular, it sees this year¡¯s headline inflationto average at the bottom of the 0.5-1.5% range it expected
        earlier, while theMAS core average 1.5%, vs the 1-2% expected earlier. For 2018, the MAS sees arelatively stable
        MAS core inflation of 1-2%, while lowering the headline inflationrange to 0¨C1%. The MAS sees economy-wide cost
        pressures to remain relativelyrestrained, amid subdued wage and rentals pressure, although oil and food
        pricesare likely to head higher, modestly.<br/><br/>
        Although the surge in GDP growth in Q3 prompted the MAS to become moreoptimistic, noting that this year¡¯s growth
        is likely to average at the upper halfof 2¨C3%, it tempered its enthusiasm somewhat with the view that growth
        couldmoderate next year. Having said that, however, it expects growth to be moreevenly distributed, with rebound
        in domestic-oriented services. According to theadvanced estimate, Singapore¡¯s GDP growth accelerated sharply to
        6.3%qoq saar(4.6%yoy) in Q3, from 2.4% (2.9%) in Q2, led by manufacturing. The latter surged23.1% (15.5%) in Q3,
        up from 3.2% (8.2%) growth in Q2, while constructioncontracted 9.2% (6.3%) vs. 2.4% (6.8% fall) in the same
        period. Meanwhile,services growth slowed to 1.5% (2.6%) in Q3 from 3.3% (2.5%) in Q2.<br/><br/>
        The MAS expects this year¡¯s growth to remain below 3%, suggesting a relativelylarge payback in growth to below
        2%yoy in Q4. Indeed, as mentioned in ourOctober Asia Economics monthly, we expect destocking to be a meaningful
        dragon growth during this quarter. Having said that, however, the surge in GDP growthin Q3 would add about
        0.5ppts to our current growth forecast of 2.5% for 2017while posing 0.3ppts upside risk to our GDP growth
        forecast of 2.4% for 2018.<br/><br/>
        After the likely sharp slowdown in Q4, we expect a significant rebound in growthin Q1, with more even growth,
        prompting the MAS to adopt a more hawkishstance, as inflation prints largely above its expectations.</p>
