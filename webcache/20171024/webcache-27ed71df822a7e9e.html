    <p> Key mobile games rebounded in Sepdriven by game updates.<br/><br/>
        NetEase¡¯s top grossing games have experienced volatility in Jul but stabilized in Aug, and reboundedin Sep.
        Nevertheless, overall rankingsare still well below their highestlevels, exceptFWJ, whichhas returned to #2
        spotfrom trough of #4in Mar 2017 whileWJOand Ghostshowed recovery trend (ranked#11 and #8in Sep 2017).
        Onmyojicontinued slipping to #21 in Sep.Thus, we expect another6% QoQ drop in 3Q17¡¯s mobile gaming revenue after
        2Q17¡¯s 13% sequential decline. From a YoY perspective, we expect mobile gaming growth momentum to decelerate
        from 89%in 1H17 to 40% in 2H17.PC games are likely to experience sequential decline due to weakness in
        Blizzard¡¯s WoW and Overwatch. Overall, as we have pointed earlier, we expect NetEase¡¯s overall gaming revenue to
        remain anemic in 3Q17, and we are modelling a single digit QoQdecline in total online game net
        revenue.<br/><br/>
        NewAR gameslaunched;Battleground type gamesin the pipeline.<br/><br/>
        Minecraftfor PC JAVA version started open beta on August 8 with positive preliminary feedback. The mobile
        version for iOS was launched on Sep 15 and free download reached #1 spot initiallybut receded to #10 on Oct
        9.Initial focus will be to direct traffic back to officialservers and monetization will be gradual, e.g.
        appearances, smallgames; we expect insignificant contribution initially.Index, a hard-core,niched game based on
        Japanese novelIP, was launched on August 31.NTES also released2 interesting AR games, includingTwilight
        Pioneers:Dragon ARenaon Sep19 and YuME on Sep 23, both with high hardware requirements, the former requires at
        least iPhone6s.Looking ahead, Forever 7, another Japanese-themed RPGs is scheduled to launch in 4Q17, which
        should help boostinggaming revenue. Our research also shows company¡¯s R&amp;D; teams areworking hard to roll
        outBattlegroundtype games, with some 10 ongoing projects, and1-2 titles could be launchedas early as next 3-6
        months. Hardwarecomputing power will not be a key issue, andkey obstacle should be on game
