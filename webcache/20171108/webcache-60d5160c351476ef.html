    <p> The rally so far.<br/><br/>
        China corporate and bank bonds are almost 15bp tighter on average in thepast month, outperforming broader Asia
        IG market by ~5bp. We havesummarized the performance of benchmark bonds in Figure 2 and note a fewthings: One,
        spread tightening has occurred almost across the board, withcorporates and banks, SOEs and private sector,
        stronger and weaker SOEs.<br/><br/>
        Two, contrary to consensus expectations, lower rated, non-100% Central SOEshave outperformed the A-rated, blue
        chip SOEs that are wholly owned by theCentral SASAC. Three, benchmark 10-year bonds have done the bestgenerally,
        perhaps given their liquidity, tightening more than their short endand very long end brethren.<br/><br/>
        Can this continue.<br/><br/>
        Chinese SOEs are currently trading 50-100bp wider than the theoretical valueof a possible sovereign deal (which
        we estimated at 35-40bp for 5-year and 40-50bp for 10-year in our Monday Tidbits yesterday). The gap is 40-50bp
        forhigher rated SOEs and 75-100bp for lower rated. We look at quasis in otherAsian countries in Figure 1. In
        higher rated countries like Korea and Malaysia,100% owned SOEs trade 20-25bp behind the sovereign and non-wholly
        onesare 50-60bp wider. In BBB rated countries like Indonesia, the gap is 40-50bpon average, wider at the long
        end and narrower at the short end. Purely thisrelative value argument suggests further tightening potential for
        Chinesenames if the sovereign deal prints where we expect it to.<br/><br/>
        Playing the devil¡¯s advocate.<br/><br/>
        Three counter arguments can be made to the potential for further tightening:Owning Chinese SOEs as a proxy to
        the sovereign deal is consensus. If andwhen further tightening happens, profit takers might all try to exit at
        the sametime, hurting technicals. Supply from China Inc. should also increase post thesovereign deal, which
        could again impact technicals. Plus, a further 10bptightening will put Chinese corporates in line to tighter
        than their DM peers(Figures 3 to 5). They have historically always traded at a premium to DM. Ifthey start
        trading flat to tighter, will EM and crossover investors buy them?Our strategy.<br/><br/>
        Regular readers would know that we have preferred high quality SOEs in theChina corporate space, with ChemChina
        being our only BBB pick for a while.<br/><br/>
        We have also been gradually closing our Buy recommendations. Three Gorgesin our Monthly report on Sep 12. We
        also close ChemChina EUR in this note,leaving us with Buys on Sinopec 3.125% 2023s, State Grid 2027s
        andChemChina 2022s. All these bonds still look relatively attractive in theirrespective rating buckets (Figures
        6 &amp; 7). Our Sells are on Baidu 2022s andLenovo 2022s. Amongst Financials, we retain our preference for sub
        debt overseniors in the bank space. We like senior bonds for select AMC, insurers &amp;leasing; companies.
        Please refer to the last Asia Credit Monthly for risks &amp;rationales; on our picks &amp; pans.<br/><br/>
        Recommendation changes.<br/><br/>
        Downgrading ChemChina EUR 2021s (G+167bp bid) from Buy to Hold onvaluation grounds. Key downside risks are
        further supply, high leverage &amp;acquisitive; appetite, negative headlines on Syngenta and lack of
        completetransparency as a private company, while upside risks include companydelivering on its deleveraging
        plans, etc.</p>
