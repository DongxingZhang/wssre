    <p> Investment Strategy: Stock market short-term direction will depend on Fed Chair nomination<br/><br/>
        Donald Trump is expected to announce his nomination for the next Fed Chair this week as JanetYellen¡¯s term will
        end in Feb 2018. Of the three likely candidates, Yellen and Powell have provedthat their policy stance is
        relatively dovish and market-friendly, whereas Taylor is relatively hawkish,indicating his negative view on the
        QE programme several times in recent years. If Taylor isnominated, he is generally expected to speed up the pace
        of rate hikes. If Powell or Yellen isnominated, we would expect stock markets to get a boost.<br/><br/>
        China Property: Solid property price appreciation potential in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area<br/><br/>
        China¡¯s NDRC and the governments of Guangdong and the Hong Kong and Macau SARs signed anagreement in July to
        deepen cooperation and development in the bay area, which will be positionedas a leading international city
        cluster. Shenzhen is positioned as a world-leading high-tech city witha strong domestic capital market, Hong
        Kong as a leading international financial center and sourcefor international professional services and global
        talent, and Guangzhou and other cities asadvanced manufacturing centers. We believe the region will be a major
        growth driver for China overthe next decade. Logan Property and Yuexiu Property are our related top
        picks.<br/><br/>
        Vanke (2202HK, Underperform): 9M17earnings up 34% YoY, in line with expectations<br/><br/>
        9M17revenue was flat, while boosted by an improving gross margin, net earnings rose 34% YoY, inline with market
        expectations. We see good earnings visibility for 2018, forecasting EPS will grow25%/20% YoY in 2017/18, but
        believe Vanke is expensively valued given the ongoing propertymarket down-cycle. We expect GFA sold to drop 10%
        YoY in 2018, which will prove a challenge forChina developers. Once the down-cycle is accepted by investors,
        China property share prices coulddrop by 20-40%. We believe Vanke¡¯s current valuation does not factor in the
        down-cycle. ReiterateUnderperform.<br/><br/>
        Ping An (2318HK, Buy): New business value up 35.5% YoY in 3Q17<br/><br/>

        insurance agents are still increasing, supporting its agency-channel life insurancebusiness in 2018; 2) as the
        life insurance sector is focusing more on protection-type products, largerlife insurers such as Ping An will
        have a competitive advantage in areas such as sales channels andinsurance claim services; 3) it is likely that
        the 750D-MA of the 10Y Chinese government bond yieldwill move up, releasing accounting profit for life insurance
        companies.<br/><br/>
        CPIC (2601HK, Buy): Agency-channel regular FYP up 38% YoY in 3Q17<br/><br/>

        in 3Q17was a strong 38% YoY despite a growthslowdown during the quarter. The company had rapid growth in the
        number of life insurance agentsin 1H17, which will support its new premiums growth going forward. In addition, a
        likely uptick in the750D-MA of the 10Y Chinese government bond yield will release accounting profit for life
        insurancecompanies. Maintain Buy.<br/><br/>

        premiums are regular FYPs with durations longerthan ten years. With a valuation now based on 2018financials, we
        raise our target price fromHK$46.10to HK$63.00, and upgrade the stock from Accumulate to Buy.</p>
