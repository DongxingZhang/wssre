    <p> Lebanon's financial stability in the near term largely depends on the depositinflows into its banking system. In
        this note, we argue why it is difficult totheoretically conclude that the recent political crisis in Lebanon
        should inducechanges in the strategic behaviour of depositors and precipitate financialinstability in the very
        near term.<br/><br/>
        This note attempts to address questions about the actual onset of a financialcrisis in Lebanon. The weak
        macroeconomic fundamentals of Lebanon hasbeen a concern, and economists have been warning about the
        financialvulnerabilities of the country for many years.<br/><br/>
        One may ask why a crisis has not unfolded yet and whether it is bound tohappen soon, in light of the recent
        sell-off of Lebanese securities and thepressure to convert the domestic currency following Prime Minister
        Hariri¡¯sresignation.<br/><br/>
        The European Exchange rate Mechanism and the Mexican peso collapsed in theearly 1990¡¯s; however, had there been
        sell-offs by speculators earlier (at least twoyears in Europe and a year in Mexico), it would have been enough
        to force thecollapse1. Why do crises unfold at the point of time when they do?It is important to pay attention
        to macroeconomic fundamentals as drivers offinancial cycles; yet, this alone is not able to explain the data on
        historical crises.<br/><br/>
        The missing piece of the puzzle is the coordination failure that occurs betweeninvestors or debt
        holders.<br/><br/>
        First as a brief background, Lebanon¡¯s rising gross public debt seems to be on anunsustainable path. Gross
        public debt reached USD 74.9bn by the end of 2016,or 149.2% of GDP. Debt figures for Q3-2017 have deteriorated;
        gross publicdebt reached USD 78.15bn, of which 61.8% is in local currency and 38.2% is inforeign currency (USD
        27.49bn in Eurobonds).</p>
