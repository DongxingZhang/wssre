    <p> The uptrend resumed as expected after the last update as price continued to march higher withthe 20 and 60 day
        moving average acting as a springboard shown by the highlighted boxes.<br/><br/>
        Even after the recent selloff near the 13.24 resistance area since 20/10/17, the uptrendremained intact as the
        60 day moving average once again halted the decline. In addition, theuptrend formation of higher highs (HH) and
        higher lows (HL) remained in play. In total, pricecorrected -11% off the 13.30 high but the recent bullish
        rebound off the confluence of 60 daymoving average and 11.84 resistance turned support area signals the
        resumption of theuptrend.<br/><br/>
        After testing the support area on 15/11/17, buyers made a recovery higher and very likelyformed the next higher
        low point (HL) at the 15/11/17 low of 11.78. Moreover, the subsequentbullish follow through on 27/11/17 also
        broke price above the pullback line and 20 daymoving average with increasing volume signals a reacceleration of
        the bullish momentum.<br/><br/>
        Expect price to move back into the uptrend to test the 13.24 resistance area followed by13.60.</p>
