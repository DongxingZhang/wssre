    <p> CEEMEA corporate credit spreads widened by 5bps in November, breaking thesequence of two consecutive monthly
        spread tightening in September andOctober. This comes in line with our expectation as highlighted in our
        OctoberRV monitor that going into the close of the year, there is potential for spreadwidening on the back of
        macro headwinds and idiosyncratic risks. CEEMEAcredit also underperformed compared to the overall EM corporate
        index whichwidened by 2bps in Oct. The weakness in Turkish and Middle Easterncorporates seems to have weighed on
        this underperformance as geo-politicalnoise resurfaced in the region and Turkish credits came under pressure
        owingto Lira¡¯s continued depreciation and growing concerns of potential fines forTurkish banks by the US
        authorities. Recall that in late October, we loweredour Buy recommendations on several Turkish bank bonds to
        Hold on the backof these risks. Going ahead, as we inch towards the end of 2017, we will betaking stock of
        broader fundamental and technical trends for CEEMEA creditsacross different sectors and regions and target to
        publish our 2018 outlook inthe coming days/weeks.</p>
