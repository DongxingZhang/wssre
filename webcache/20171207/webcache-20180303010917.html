    <p> Recently, the med.china.com.cn (ÖÐ¹úÒ½ÁÆ) reported that the relevantdepartment of the State Council has implemented
        the reform for government¡¯sreimbursement payment system to hospitals. This has extended to at least 11
        trialprovinces, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Hunan, Chongqing,Sichuan, Shaanxi, Qinghai
        and Ningxia. Different types of reimbursement paymentmethods have been explored, including by each disease types
        and the traditionalway of patient numbers. The former method is to determine how much thegovernment pays the
        hospital for each medicine or consumable, as patients withineach category (say by disease types) are clinically
        similar and are expected to needthe same level of hospital resources. This is so-called diagnosis-related
        group(DRG).<br/><br/>
        As we flagged in our 12 Sept 2017 report, there were 36 high-priced drugs addedinto provincial reimbursement
        drug list (RDL) post negotiation with government(¹ú¼ÒÌ¸ÅÐÒ©Æ·). On 28 Nov 2017, Yaozh.com reported that those revenue
        fromthese 36 medicines will unlikely be counted into the hospital sales book as drugsales to patients. To
        recall, the government has attempted to cut the hospitalrevenue derived from drug sales to patients to 30% of
        total from over 40%-50% inthe past, scrapping the mark-up sales of drugs from hospital to patients. Theprovinces
        and cities that will likely adopt this policy are Tangshan City (ÌÆÉ½ÊÐ),Chongqing, Anhui, Zhejiang and Guangzhou.
        Taking Chongqing as an example, itintended to have these 36 medicine sales not counted as hospital revenue
        fromdrug sales to patients. On this, it also covers another three high-priced medicines,namely Tenofovir
        Disoproxil Fumarate ÌæÅµ¸£Î¤õ¥ (Viread?), IcotinibHCl ÑÎËá°£¿ËÌæÄá (Conmana?) and Gefitinib ¼ª·ÇÌæÄá (Iressa?). The same
        articleexpects more provinces will follow the suit.<br/><br/>
        Our view: Neutral to positive on drug-makers.<br/><br/>
        Consistent with government policy on controlling the unnecessary spending andmedical reimbursement cost to
        patients, the current advance of this paymentsystem will save the money for reimbursement on (1) other specialty
        medicineswith good efficacy; and (2) diagnostics and surgical operation charges in hospitals.<br/><br/>
        Further, having these 39 medicine sales not recognized as hospital revenue fromdrug sales, would help their
        drug-makers¡¯ sales volume boost in the future. This isbecause of more procurement of these 39 medicines from
        hospitals, on greaterprescription and sales to patients.<br/><br/>
        HK Stock impact: Within the 36 drug list plus another three medicinesmentioned, the HK-listed drug-makers that
        will likely benefit from sales volumeboost are (1) China Medical System (CMS) (867.HK, NR) with its marketing
        product- XinHuoSu (ÐÂ»îËØ?) (a heart &amp; brain drug) on the list, whose sales in 2016 ofRMB537m made up 11% of
        CMS total revenue; and (2) Sinobiopharm (1177.HK,NR) for its Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ÌæÅµ¸£Î¤õ¥ (Qingzhong?)
        which hadalready won Heilongjiang tender at RMB430 per 300mg format in Nov 2017. Thistender is 12% discount to
        that of the original medicine from GSK¡¯s Viread? atRMB490 for the same format in Sichuan, Gansu, Chongqing,
        Shanxi, Hubei, Ningxiaand Guangdong. In 2017, Qingzhong had already been approved in China for anti-HIV
        treatment.</p>
