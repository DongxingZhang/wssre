        profit in the division jumped 29.3% y-y, rising for the first time insix quarters, as orders recovered and

        hike in the discountproduct portion of sales and openings of new NBA Kids stores in China.<br/><br/>

        portion of sales and a lack of visiblesynergies among acquired firms. In particular, Scott Sports recorded a net

        Industry conditions improving but preparation time needed: Although globalbuyers have yet to see upward
        revisions to their earnings forecasts, we believe the apparelmarket is past the worst. Order trends at buyers
        recently boil down to boosting turnoverby reducing lead time. We believe that OEMs are best positioned to
        effectively respond tothe changing trends considering their: 1) ability to source raw materials via economies
        ofscale; 2) efforts to win new orders; and 3) ability to maintain facility investments (eg, forautomation).<br/><br/>
        Maintaining Hansae¡¯s target, cutting Youngone¡¯s: We keep Hansae at BUY withan unchanged target price of
        KRW33,000. We believe the firm is effectively responding torapidly-changing order trends of buyers. Shares are
        trading at 13x 2018 P/E, a24% discount to those of peers. For Youngone, we lower our 2018 EPS forecast by 5%
        andcut our target price by 5% to KRW42,000 to reflect uncertainties related to Scott Sports.<br/><br/>
        Shares are trading at 10.4x 2018 P/E, or a 38% discount to those of peers. To narrow avaluation gap with global
        competitors, domestic OEMs need to expand new orders andhike investments in vertical integration and automation
        visibly.</p>
