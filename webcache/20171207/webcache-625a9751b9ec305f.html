    <p> The Brexit talks were just as hard as expected. Even with the UK¡¯s Prime Minister, Theresa May, demonstrating a
        much softer stance during her Florence speech in late September, Brexit negotiations were basically stalled with
        no actual progresses achieved since then. Mainly due to EU¡¯s hard stance on settling the exit bill first before
        any talks on transition and other issues, and the tension regarding the Irish border, as well as UK¡¯s internal
        divergence on the exit bill, the possibility of delayed trade talks and ¡°Brexit with no deal¡± significantly
        increased during the past two months. Only until recently, breakthroughs have been achieved: 1) UK finally
        agrees to fully honor its financial obligations with the EU budget and prepares to pay around EUR 40-50 billion;
        2) a broad outline on the Irish border is under discussion between UK and Ireland and an agreement is expected
        to be achieved as soon as this week.<br/><br/>
        From the UK¡¯s original hard stances of ¡°no deal is better than a bad deal¡± to the recent compromises made to
        satisfy EU¡¯s demands, it has verified our previous view that the UK does not have much leverage in Brexit
        negotiations and the ¡°no-deal¡± scenario is the most harmful to UK itself. Thus, it is not surprising to see
        that, in order to kick off the most important trade talks, the UK has made further concessions to the EU on its
        financial obligations. Unlike May¡¯s Florence speech which agreed to pay the exit bill depending on reaching the
        transitional deal, the UK now agreed to fully honor its financial commitments depending on nothing. The gross
        liability is assumed to be worth up to EUR 100 billion, including contingent liabilities that unwind overtime,
        and the net payment is expected to be around EUR 40-50 billion (very close to EU¡¯s initial bid of EUR 60
        billion), spreading over years. The exit bill is expected to be signed this week, and the actual number may not
        be disclosed to the public to avoid possible political oppositions. As Germany, France and other EU members
        appeared to be satisfied with the outline of the exit bill, this could remove one of the biggest obstacles to
        the Brexit trade talks.<br/><br/>
        Moreover, another key issue that needs to be solved before trade talks is the Irish border within the Common
        Travel Area (comprising Ireland and Northern Ireland). The Ireland is seeking concrete guarantees from the UK
        that there will be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland after UK leaves the
        EU single market. A month ago, the UK turned down EU¡¯s proposal that the Northern Ireland could remain in the EU
        customs union after Brexit, and it is now drafting a deal that makes a credible commitment to avoid the hard
        border. The deal could be finished as soon as this week, but still, it needs to fully satisfy the Republic of
        Ireland before talks on future EU-UK relations and transition deal could begin.<br/><br/>
        On UK¡¯s economy, we maintain our previous view that Brexit would increase uncertainties and dampen UK¡¯s growth
        outlook. Against such backdrop, BoE¡¯s November rate hike was only meant to curb the high inflation caused by the
        weaker pound; and with the possible breakthroughs in Brexit talks, we see upside risks now outweigh downside
        risks on the GBP exchange rates. Thus, we do not expect frequent rate hikes of the BoE going forward.<br/><br/>
        Finally, December could be a busy month for key overseas¡¯ political events to watch. Except for the possible
        breakthrough of Brexit talks, eyes are also on the US tax reform. After the Senate voted to pass its tax bill
        two days ago, it now enters the reconciliation process which will determine whether the bill could be signed by
        Trump before Christmas. Besides, the German coalition talks between Canceler Merkel and Social Democratic
        Party¡¯s (SPD) leader Martin Shultz are also crucial. After Merkel¡¯s failure of forming the Jamaica coalition
        with the Green Party and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the grand coalition with SPD is now the only way to
        avoid a second election or a minority government. Whether the grand coalition between Merkel (CDU/CSU) and
        Shultz (SPD) could be achieved is key to Germany or even EU¡¯s future.</p>
