    <p> Banks¡¯ cost of funds index (Cofix) rate on new funds in October was up 10bps fromSeptember and 15bps from
        August. The Cofix rate should rise again in Novembergiven that yields on 1-year KTBs have leapt 32bps from
        September levels.<br/><br/>
        The recent jump in market interest rates should renew growth in banks¡¯ NIMs from4Q. Comparable growth in
        interest rates in 2H16 led NIM at KB Financial Group andHana Financial Group to rise 13bps and 14bps,
        respectively, over 1Q-3Q17.<br/><br/>
        While all three of Korea¡¯s biggest financial groups should enjoy NIM growth, ourtop pick is KBFG. We also like
        HFG for its sector-high earnings sensitivity tointerest rate hikes.</p>
