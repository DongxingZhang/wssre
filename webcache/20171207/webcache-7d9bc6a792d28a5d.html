    <p> SARB kept rates unanimously on hold at 6.75%, in line with expectations<br/><br/>
        The rates were left on hold at today's meeting, with an unanimous vote, comparedto a 3-3split at the last
        meeting. This was combined with a more hawkish thanexpected statement and new policy rate forecasts till
        end-2019from the QuarterlyProjection Model showing a cumulative 75bps hikes (this was not published bySARB
        earlier)1.<br/><br/>
        The opening paragraph of the press statement set the tone, stating upfront thatthe upside risks to inflation
        outlook has increased on the back of higher globalcrude prices and a weaker outlook for the exchange rate. The
        exchange ratehas depreciated by 3.3% in trade-weighted terms since the last meeting. Thecentral bank also
        expressed concerns that elevated domestic event risks arelikely to affect monetary policy through the exchange
        rate channel. The MTBPSand speculation regarding introduction of free higher education in South Africa,increase
        the risk of a potential downgrade by credit rating agencies (Moody's andS&amp;P; reviews due tomorrow) and could
        trigger significant forced outflows. Furtherdomestic risks to the exchange rate emanate from uncertainty
        surroundingthe ANC electoral conference in December and a faster-than-expected pace ofmonetary tightening in the
        US. The Eskom request for a sizeable increase inelectricity tariffs also pose a significant risk to the
        inflation outlook. The centralbank is still awaiting clarity on this issue as of now. The press statement
        thusnotes that in light of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the economy,the MPC decided to keep
        policy rate unchanged.</p>
