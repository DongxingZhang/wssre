    <p> Yangtze Optical Fibre stock rallied 10.1% on 16 November, since which point it has rallied afurther 10.5% after
        recovering from a 15% four-day correction. We attribute the strong pricegrowth to an uptick in investor
        sentiment following China Mobile¡¯s (941:HK - N-R) 2018 opticalcable tender notice. While the scale of the
        tender, at 80% larger than last year¡¯s procurement,came in substantially higher than market expectations, we do
        not expect a sharp increase infibre prices in this tender and we thus maintain our EPS forecasts, of Rmb1.78 in
        17E (+72.8%YoY), Rmb2.08 in 18E (+16.9% YoY), and Rmb2.39 in 19E (+14.9% YoY). We raise our target pricefrom
        HK$29.45 to HK$44.00 (18x 18E PE). With 14% upside, we maintain our Outperform rating.<br/><br/>
        Higher than expected demand. China Mobile issued a first-round 2018 optical cable tendernotice for c.110m fibre
        kilometres for 1H18, up 79.9% YoY, well in excess of market expectations.<br/><br/>
        As China Mobile accounts for c.50% of the optical cable purchased in the domestic market, weinterpret this
        larger-than-expected procurement as signaling solid demand for optical cable inthe remainder of the year. We
        believe that China Mobile¡¯s domestic demand in 2018E will totalat least 210m fkm and total domestic demand will
        expand 30-40% YoY even if rival carriers ChinaTelecom (728:HK ¨COutperform) and China Unicom (762:HK ¨C BUY)
        tenders remain stable in2018. For China Mobile, the high demand stems from its increased effort to build out its
        fixedlinebroadband services and enterprise network, both of which require more optical cable.<br/><br/>
        Little upside to tender prices. The tender price for China Mobile in 2016 was capped atRmb68/fkm. We expect the
        final tender price in the latest round of procurement will increase,given short supply of optical preforms. With
        optical cable prices already high, we see limitedroom for price growth in the near-term, and we estimate a
        maximum tender price increase inChina Mobile¡¯s tender will be capped at 10% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Telco Capex downcycle. We believe the three domestic telcos are broadly looking to keep Capexin check in
        2017-18, and we anticipate overall Capex outlay among the three will decline c.8%YoY in 17E. Assuming no
        acceleration in the schedule to commercialise 5G networks to 2018, weexpect Capex to fall further in 18E,
        although we see potential for China Unicom to increaseoutlay slightly in 18E off an extremely low 17E Capex
        base.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Outperform. Given higher than expected industry demand, we believe Yangtze Opticalwill continue to
        expand its market share in the mainland market. We maintain our EPS forecastsof Rmb1.78 in 17E (+72.8% YoY),
        Rmb2.08 in 18E (+16.9% YoY), and Rmb2.39 in 19E (+14.9%YoY). We raise our target price from HK$29.45 to HK$44.00
        (18x 18E PE). With 14% upside, wemaintain our Outperform rating.</p>
