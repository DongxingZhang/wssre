    <p> Annual CPI accelerated to 13%YoY in November from 11.9% in October, wellabove market (and our) expectations.
        This is the highest print since December2003, and represents the all-time high during Turkey's formal (and
        shadow)inflation-targeting regime.<br/><br/>
        Consumer prices advanced by 1.5%MoM, and came in 1.1 percentage points(pp) above their historical average during
        November, which is seasonally a lowinflationmonth in Turkish standards. Main drivers were food and
        transportation,having accounted for half of the monthly rise. Fruits and vegetables rose by7.2%MoM and exerted
        the main upside pressure within the food componentwhile red meat prices were down by 3% thanks to authorities'
        recent measures.<br/><br/>
        Pump prices leapt by 4.4% on the month, reflecting scars from weaker TRY andhigher global Brent prices. Impact
        from renewed FX pass-through was evidentacross the board as prices for vehicle, PC, camera, mobile phone,
        personal careitems were all higher. Spillover effects from reintroduction of taxes on whitegoods and furniture
        in October were also visible, particularly given that they havecoincided with rising demand-pull pressure
        emanating from the positive outputgap. Services, meanwhile, were slightly below expectations on the back of
        lowerbus and plane fares. Clothing also displayed a softer rise than its seasonal trendduring November.</p>
