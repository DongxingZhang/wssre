    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +3.6%. Weekly loadings down 0.5%<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 3.6% in Week#48(ended 11/25/2017) vs. a 4.1%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 1.0%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings decreased 0.5% YoY (versus a 4.4%
        increase in the priorweek) and decreased 15.5% sequentially (vs. a 4.2% increase in the priorweek).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices down 1c/gal to 25c/gal. Propane down 2c/gal to 98c/gal<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices fell 1.3c/gal this week to 24.6c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20c/gal).While US ethane supply/demand
        (s/d) fundamentals remain loose, ethanerejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has declined following
        theSeptember ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethane export facilityin Houston. Starting in 1H¡¯18, we
        expect US ethane s/d fundamentals totighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from the start-up of
        8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens, we expectethane to trade toward its historical
        premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuel value, withthe premium reflecting fractionation, transportation and storage
        costs. Basedon DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas price forecast of $3.02/MMBtu, we estimateethane prices will likely move
        toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.Propane prices fell 2.3c/gal this week to 97.8c/gal. While propane
        inventorieswere down 1% last week to 73MM bbls, they are 21% and 12% below their 3and 5-yr avgs, respectively.
        Longer term, we expect propane inventories todecline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in
        ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene down 0.5c/lb to 27c/lb. Margins flat at 11c/lb<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 0.5c/lb yhis week to 27.1c/lb (vs the Novembercontract price of 33.25c/lb). Spot deals
        for November ranged from 26.5to27.75c/lb with deals for December ranged between 26.75-27.625c/lb.Average spot
        ethylene margins compressed 0.2c/lb last week to 10.8c/lb aslower selling prices more than offset lower
        production costs.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forNovember delivery at 47.5-48.0c/lb.
        November propylene contract pricessettled up 1c/lb at 49.0c/lb for PG and 47.5c/lb for chemical grade.
        Thisfollows a 7c/lb increase in September, and 1.5c/lb increase in October. The9.5c/lb, or 24%, increase in
        propylene prices since September has been drivenby supply tightness due to Hurrricane Harvey which caused
        outages atmultiple US Gulf Coast olefins and refinieres as well as delaying a new propanedehydrogenation (PDH)
        unit which had been scheduled to start up inSeptember.<br/><br/>
        2.1% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in December<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, CPChem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) is offline this week
        due to an operational upset. For ¡¯17, IHSforecasts NA ethylene production losses of 5.1B lbs, or 6.1%, of
        capacity. Thiscompares to 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, ofethylene capacity in
        ¡¯15.</p>
