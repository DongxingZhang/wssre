    <p> Daehan Steel yesterday said its consolidated sales and operating profit fell14.7% and 75.5% q-q, respectively,
        to KRW378.8b and KRW5b in 3Q. At Korea Iron&amp; Steel (Kisco), parent-based sales increase 1% q-q to KRW190b,
        while operatingprofit plunged 72% q-q to KRW5.7b.<br/><br/>
        In spite of weak seasonality, both firms posted solid sales volumes thanks tostrong demand and a y-y increase in
        business days (as the Chuseok holidays fellon October this year vs September last year). Nonetheless, unforeseen
        increasesin scrap prices and a subsequent q-q narrowing of rebar spreads weighed onquarterly earnings. We
        foresee rebar spreads widening q-q in 4Q as rebar referenceprices have climbed KRW50,000-60,000/tonne since
        mid-August and domesticscrap prices have been stable since last month.<br/><br/>
        Recent regulatory tightening in the real estate market implies limited room forconstruction industry growth next
        year, and we advise investors to pay moreattention to downside than the possibility of additional upside. That
        said, asconstruction start area is experiencing a soft landing and the Chinese importportion of Korea¡¯s rebar
        market is declining, we expect deterioration of thedomestic rebar to be slow. This means capital utilization
        will be a key determinantfor rebar shares. We maintain our BUY ratings on Daehan Steel and Kisco, and weadvise
        investors to employ trading buy strategies for the pair.</p>
