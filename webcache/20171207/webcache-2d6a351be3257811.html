    <p> Project driven cash flow growth<br/><br/>
        We enter 2018feeling considerable enthusiasm on the potential for theEuropean oils sector both absolute and
        relative. No doubt our confidence ishelped by the much better feel to commodity markets and a price deck that,
        inour opinion, affords risk to the upside. Most significantly, however, our positivetone reflects our view that
        after three very challenging years the majorEuropean companies have repositioned their businesses to work in a
        $50/bblworld and that as the benefit of the cash flows from project starts accelerate,free cash is set for
        material expansion. In a world that shows very littlevaluation differentiation preferred names remain BP and
        Shell.<br/><br/>
        Macro themes ¨C upside risk in oil, gas excess coming, downstream robust<br/><br/>
        Crude: OPEC extension should underpin price in a market that is alreadymoving towards balance and which, post a
        third year of modest projectsanctions is setting itself up for medium term squeeze. Natural gas and
        LNG:<br/><br/>
        In another 25mtpa supply build year will China sneeze? An ever moreimportant source of end market demand, its
        growth is needed if Europe is toavoid catching a nasty cold. Downstream: Low product inventories combinedwith
        moderate build in capacity suggest a market that should allow refiners toenjoy another cash generative year with
        IMO a looming underpin.<br/><br/>
        Company cash jaws set to open; Rest in peace the Big Oil scrip<br/><br/>
        Three years on from the price collapse and the heavy lifting has been done. Bigoil works at $50/bbl with the
        much maligned scrip now officially consigned tothe coffin. Look to the future and there is much to encourage.
        Supported bythe continuing wave of project start-ups (+$13bn) we expect free cash flow toaggressively expand
        affording management the opportunity to both rewardshareholders and allocate capital to a re-worked set of
        investmentopportunities that our analysis suggests healthy double digit return. A secondyear of c5% volume
        expansion, the sector¡¯s cash jaws look set to meaningfullyopen, sector CFFO rising by over 10% towards $130bn
        and with growingleverage to the improving commodity tone.<br/><br/>
        Preferred stocks: Shell (Buy 2700p) and BP (Buy 545p)<br/><br/>
        We may stand fairly accused of sounding like a broken record. But betweenvaluation, operating momentum and
        shareholder commitment we enter 2018as we ended 2017with a decided preference for the UK mega caps. A mix ofcash
        flow acceleration, most notably at BP, and total return potential ourexpectations for yield compression suggest
        real scope for continued healthycapital appreciation. Within Europe predictability and opportunity underpin
        ourpreference for Total (Buy ?51) although we recognize the greater FCFYleverage to price at ENI (Hold ?14.5)
        and the potential for performance ifconfidence in delivery can rise from its current nadir. Following earlier
        thanexpect scrip removal and reduced dilution we raise Repsol to Hold (?14.75) butleave Statoil (Hold NOK165)
        and GALP (Hold ?15.7) unchanged. Amongst thelarge E&amp;Ps;, we reiterate our Buy on Tullow (225p) where low
        capex intensivegrowth drives c.$500m p.a. FCF at DB deck to help repair the b/s. We thinkthat investors may be
        looking at the potential for both Lundin (Hold SEK190)and Aker BP (Hold NOK 182) to offer progressive dividend
        policies over thenext 5years, which we feel stretches traditional portfolio-based valuations.</p>
