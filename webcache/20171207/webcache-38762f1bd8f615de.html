    <p> Since the election, investors have focused on whether or not a tax bill wouldget through Congress. With
        successful votes in the House and Senate,attention is now shifting toward economic and market implications. Even
        afterthe President signs tax reform into law, company-level implications will remainunclear for quite some time.
        The only certainty is that investors will be left withgreater uncertainty on the trajectory of corporate
        earnings and cash flows for2018-19. As such, we believe the market will focus on four key issues over thenear
        term:<br/><br/>
        1) Effective Tax Rate. While the current statutory rate is 35%, companiesare paying only 27% on average. While
        specifics are unclear, investors arepresuming the new effective rate will move toward 20%. If the changegoes
        into effect in 2018, consensus EPS would jump from $146 to $160.<br/><br/>
        2) Potential Upside. Historically, investors have rewarded revenues andEBIT margins more than taxes. As such, we
        would expect much¡ªbut notall¡ªof the improvement in EPS to pass through to stock prices. Theexhibit below
        highlights that the tax benefit has not yet been fully realized.<br/><br/>
        3) Greatest Beneficiaries. Given that the full extent of tax reform is difficultto ascertain, we recommend that
        investors focus on relative beneficiaries.<br/><br/>
        Lists of potential winners and losers are highlighted on pages 59-66.<br/><br/>
        4) Economic and Second Order Effects. The full impact of the new taxcode is impossible to calculate given yet
        unknown behavioral changes.<br/><br/>
        These include the use of repatriated assets for capex, buybacks, andM&amp;A;, as well as the stimulative
        benefits to consumer spending.</p>
