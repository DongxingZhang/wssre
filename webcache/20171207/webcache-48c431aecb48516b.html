    <p> Over the past three weeks, we met with investors in Europe and Asia todiscuss China macro and markets. The
        sentiment is even better than sixmonths ago when we did the previous round of global marketing (ourtakeaways
        back then: Highest sentiment in two years). Investors are nolonger concerned about traditional risks such as
        debt, property, currency andcapital outflows. Instead the key interests include the macro outlook for 2018(the
        consensus is a gradual and modest slowdown), the ongoing financialtightening, the risk of inflation and rate
        hike, also the medium-term outlookafter the Party Congress. The note covers the main topics of
        conversation.<br/><br/>
        Sentiment: Turning even better<br/><br/>
        Sentiment is upbeat now as investors cited various reasons to stay bullish: theglobal economy is recovering in a
        synchronized way; The rally so far is drivenby EPS growth, so valuation is higher but not crazy; The breadth of
        rally is solimited that there is room for chasing laggards; The rally has concentrated onsector leaders and junk
        stocks haven¡¯t moved much. The valuation for Chinafinancials and SOEs are much lower compared with their global
        peers; globalEM funds still underweight China and more southbound money from mainland<br/><br/>
        China will come to HK next year¡­<br/><br/>
        Interestingly, during the trip, the amount of time we spent on debt is probablythe least since 2011. The views
        expressed in our note, China¡¯s Debt: Mythsand Realities, which used to be quite controversial, have become
        theconsensus. Also our positive RMB view, which used to receive close to 100%pushback 12months ago, has also
        become the consensus.<br/><br/>
        Overall, our impression as economists is that while the consensus used to beoverly pessimistic toward China, now
        it is starting to turn a bit too optimistic.But we could be too sobering as the sentiment is still far from
        being extremeand could move even higher. Toward the year end, financials is a consensusbuy to park the cash, due
        to reasonable valuation and solid earnings, whilesome look to rotate into late-cycle names such as utility and
        consumerstaples, or even small caps at some point next year.<br/><br/>
        Economy: What the market could miss<br/><br/>
        Consensus at year-end often gets wrong the most important thing for the yearahead. At the end of 2015, the
        consensus was expecting a further slowdownor even a hard landing for China. But it turns out that at that time
        China wasjust under recovery with a new earnings up-cycle ahead. At the end of 2016,the consensus was expecting
        further depreciation of the RMB against theUS$. But it turns out that the RMB has strengthened against the US$
        in 2017.The reversal underpins the EM bull run this year as the RMB is the anchor ofthe whole EM currency space.<br/><br/>
        At this point, what could the consensus miss? In our view, the most likelycandidate is the downside risk from
        infrastructure investment, which grewmuch faster than other investments in the past five years. Back in
        2012,infrastructure investment was 60% of manufacture investment and 80% ofproperty investment. In 2017, it¡¯s
        90% of manufacturing investment and 20%larger than property investment. (To be continued on the next page)</p>
