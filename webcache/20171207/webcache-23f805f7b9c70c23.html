    <p> WHAT¡¯S THE STORY.<br/><br/>
        Our recent supply chain check shows that: 1) demand for certain memory products isfalling short of market
        estimates; and 2) consumers are becoming more resistant to pricehikes. Changing demand remains insufficient to
        significantly influence AI or big datatrends, but clients are showing signs of resisting price hikes by curbing
        purchases.<br/><br/>
        Enterprise SSD.<br/><br/>
        Orders for enterprise server SSD have fallen short of previous expectations while there areno visible changes in
        demand for data centers or servers, implying NAND price hikes areseemingly slowing conversion to SSD or
        curtailing its density per box. Price resistancefrom tier-2 companies is nothing new, but reduced orders by
        tier-1 data center players arebeing seen for the first time. In response, NAND suppliers are promoting
        high-densitySSD (vs price discounts) to increase per-server storage.<br/><br/>
        Memory suppliers are reassessing capacity expansion plans amid falling demand.<br/><br/>
        Samsung Electronics (SEC) is expected to have monthly capacities of 30,000 and 70,000sheets for DRAM and NAND,
        respectively, on the west wing of the Pyeongtaek fab¡¯ssecond-floor in early 2018. Equipment makers have
        confirmed orders of 30,000 sheetsapiece for DRAM and NAND next year, but the additional 40,000 sheets for the
        latter areunconfirmed. With higher prices eroding demand, there is a debate between those callingfor investment
        cuts or hikes (with the latter citing demand elasticity to price). While SECis expected to dedicate the
        Pyeongtaek fab¡¯s second-floor east wing to DRAMmanufacturing in 2H18, we do not foresee that any alteration to
        its investment plans,considering NAND supply shortages are expected in 2019.<br/><br/>
        Despite changing demand, our memory price outlook is unchanged, with NAND priceslikely flat q-q in 4Q17 and set
        to edge down in 1Q18, while those for DRAM will likely rise5-6% in 4Q17 and continue trending up in 1Q18. It
        nevertheless remains to be seen iforder declines drive down prices and eventually spur demand hikes.<br/><br/>
        iPhone demand concerns¡­.<br/><br/>
        The iPhone X debuted on Nov 3, with our channel check suggesting a mixed bag of initialresponses, and even
        though its overall sales volume has been largely as forecast, we notethat: 1) sales in the US and Japan have
        been positive as those in China and Europe havedisappointed; and 2) the 64GB version is struggling, in contrast
        with the 256GB version,which is seeing wait times of over two weeks and taking over 40% of total sales on
        lessthan 20% of total manufacturing. Such results have some worried that the iPhone X¡¯sproduct cycle might
        fizzle out earlier than most had expected once initial demand fromloyal Apple customers wanes.</p>
