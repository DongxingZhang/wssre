        profit attributable to controlling interests hitting KRW24.7b (up14.8% y-y), KRW7.2b (up 1.2% y-y), and KRW5.9b
        (down 32% y-y), respectively. Thecompany¡¯s operating margin fell 3.9%pts y-y to 29.3% on a 38% y-y hike in SG&amp;A;

        17.4% y-y), and KRW5.7b (up 86.5% y-y), respectively, withsales to dealers up 94.9% y-y to KRW4.6b. Asia
        ex-China sales rose thanks to theestablishment of a JV in Iran. The firm¡¯s overseas sales should keep growing in
        2018, ledby normalization of JVs set up last year with leading local players in China and Japan andeffects of
        more hiring of staff. Considering the global dental implant sector¡¯s re-rating andthe firm¡¯s export momentum, we
        raise our target price to KRW45,000. We expect sales togrow in earnest in 2018 on a removal of the base effect
        relating to the stent operation. Wepredict that the firm¡¯s sales will rise 9.1% y-y in 2017 and 21.7% y-y in
        2018.<br/><br/>
        Osstem Implant¡ª3Q miss: Osstem Implant posted consolidated sales of KRW99.6b(up 13.8% y-y), operating profit of
        KRW4.4b (down 62.4% y-y), and net profit attributableto controlling interests of KRW5.3b (up 82.3% y-y), missing
        consensus by 1.4%, 62.9%,and 41.1%, respectively. The company once again lost market trust in its earnings
        visibility.<br/><br/>
        Operating margin fell 9%pts y-y to 4.5% on a 27.3% y-y hike in SG&amp;A; costs (due to morehiring and bad-debt
        expenses of KRW2.6b). The firm¡¯s domestic and overseas sales rose7.8% and 29.8% y-y, respectively, to KRW47.3b
        and KRW54.3b. By region, sales to NorthAmerica, Europe, China, and Asia (ex China) hit KRW15.9b (up 13.9% y-y),
        KRW7b (up28.6% y-y), KRW19b (up 59.7% y-y), and KRW12.4b (up 18% y-y). The firm should see itstop-line stay
        strong in 4Q, but is unlikely to control SG&amp;A; expenses. Reflecting theweakened short-term momentum, we trim
        our target price to KRW81,000 anddowngrade our rating to HOLD.</p>
