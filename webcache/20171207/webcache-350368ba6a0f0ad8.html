    <p> ICBM test marks first missile test-fire in two months<br/><br/>
        North Korea today at 3:17am local time tested a new long-range missile, resumingmilitary provocation after a
        lull following the test-firing of the Hwasong-12(KN-17) onSep 15. The missile was launched from Pyeongsong (30km
        north of Pyongyang) using atransporter-erector-launcher. According to officials in South Korea, the US, and
        Japan,the missile, an ICBM, flew for around 950kms at an altitude of 4,500km and ended upwithin Japan¡¯s
        exclusive economic zone. The North calls the new missile the Hwasong-15.The new missile has advanced features
        compared to the Hwasong-12and Hwasong-14models. When launched at an ordinary angle, the weapon is believed to be
        capable ofstriking Washington DC. Moreover, the Japanese government argues that the missile cancarry multiple
        nuclear warheads. If so, this would show a significant technical advance inthe North¡¯s nuclear weapon system, as
        it means that the missile cannot be stopped bycurrent missile defense systems. South Korea¡¯s Joint Chiefs of
        Staff, however, rebuttedthis possibility.<br/><br/>
        Responses restrained from neighboring countries and financial markets<br/><br/>
        Despite today¡¯s unexpected launch, global financial markets have not shown any jitters.The response by US
        President Trump was subdued, stating the nation¡¯s North Koreapolicy remains intact and that it is closely
        monitoring the situation. This suggests the UShas an established North Korea policy and puts maximum pressure
        and economicsanctions ahead of military actions.<br/><br/>
        The Japanese government responded calmly and based on facts, contrasting with itsreaction in September after
        North Korea launched the Hwasong-12. At that time, thegovernment identified the Hwasong-12as an ICBM and issued
        J-alert even though themissile was declared an IRBM by the US. Some believe the overreaction was
        politicallydriven, with the election for the House of Representatives around the corner.<br/><br/>
        Outlook and investment strategy<br/><br/>
        North Korea¡¯s dilemma has been its slower-than-expected pace of mastering a nucleartippedlong-range missile.
        Although the nation declared that was nearing completion ofan ICBM after conducting its sixth nuclear weapons
        test, global experts still believe theNorth¡¯s missiles have imperfect re-entry ability, which is key to striking
        the mainland US.Securing such a capability may play a critical role when it meets the US at the
        negotiationtable. The North is striving to maximize its nuclear capabilities via repeated provocationsdespite
        the best efforts of related parties.<br/><br/>
        Despite today¡¯s event, we still believe chances an extreme event happening on the Koreanpeninsula are low.
        Compared to August-September, neighboring nations (including theUS) have increasingly shown their intention to
        resolve the North Korean nuclear issue ina reasonable and strategic manner. We recommend focusing on
        fundamentals (vsoverreacting to geopolitical risks) and predict that financial markets are unlikely torespond
        sensitively to scattered provocations by North Korea.</p>
