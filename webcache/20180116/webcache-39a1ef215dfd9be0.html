    <p> AT1bonds of Asian financials, especially those in China and Hong Kong, havevisibly underperformed their Snr and
        T2peers since early Dec-17and the creditdifferentiation has narrowed to the point that most now trade in a tight
        rangeof 4.6% - 5% YTC (excl. 19s-20s calls). We believe that the ongoing weaknessof select Chinese and HK AT1s
        presents a buying opportunity. Below wehighlight some of the trade ideas in light of the recent market
        developments.<br/><br/>
        Asian AT1s have underperformed their EM and DM peers<br/><br/>
        AT1s of Asian financials are now trading in a narrow band as the historicallywidest trading AT1s such as BEA
        Perp c22have tightened 60bp YTC-wisesince Jul 2017, whereas a stronger credit such as ICBC Asia AT1s
        haveactually widened 30bp in the same time period. Asian AT1securities haveunderperformed vs. their EM &amp;
        Australian counterparts (e.g. ANZ, DubaiIslamic Bank, Banco do Brasil, VTB, Alfa Bank) as average YTC of
        Asianfinancials has widened ~2.8% since end-Sep-17, whereas average YTC of peerAT1s has in fact tightened ~2.5%.
        Postal Savings Bank AT1c22stands out asthe biggest underperformer amongst all Asian AT1s as its YTC widened~50bp
        since early Nov-17(Fig 1-3). PSB AT1s used to trade flat to CITIC BankInternational c21and ~30bp tighter than
        Zheshang AT1s in early Nov-17, butnow trades ~35bp wider than the former and flat to the latter. Similarly to
        PSB,Cinda c21AT1has weakened materially YTC-wise as it used to trade ~50bptighter than AT1s of its own smaller
        subsidiary Nanyang Commercial Bank 6months ago and now trades only ~10bp tighter. We expect the
        creditdifferentiation between Cinda and the weakening fundamental profile (albeitfrom a solid base) of NCB to
        reflect in Cinda AT1¡¯s valuations and expect CindaAT1¡¯s YTC to tighten by ~35bp to reach FV. We reiterate buy on
        Cinda Perpc21AT1s (ask-price/ask-Gsp/ask-YTC of 98.8/261/4.76%).</p>
