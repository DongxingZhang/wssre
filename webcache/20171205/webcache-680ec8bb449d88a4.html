    <p> Given BRL¡¯s high score on ¡®defensive¡¯ metrics ¨C real rates, external balances,FX reserves ¨C its recent
        underperformance stands out as excessive, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Further, expectations for pension reform delivery are now low. We thereforebelieve current levels are attractive
        to go long BRL, with the currency offeringsignificant retracement potential; as one of the ¡®safer¡¯ carry longs,
        we believe itwill be among the first in EM that investors return to. We recommend fundingBRL longs with ILS, as
        shekel overvaluation is at extremes and inflation remainssubdued, which increases the possibility of BoI FX
        intervention. Further, using ILSas a funder for BRL longs eliminates most of the broad dollar risk while
        preservingthe positive carry. Go long BRLILS; while we were stopped out of our original tradedue to the large EM
        sell-off last Friday, we believe the fundamental rationale forthis trade remains intact and thus recommend
        re-initiation. See report for moredetails: EM FX trade idea: long BRL vs. ILS.</p>
