    <p> Credit Strategy - Early Morning Reid - Craig Nicol<br/><br/>
        With today being something of landmark day then, this morning we¡¯ve publisheda short Macro Bites taking a look
        at how markets and various assets haveperformed in the twelve months since Trump¡¯s election victory. We don¡¯t
        want togive too much away but it¡¯s probably not a surprise to hear that the vast majorityof assets have seen
        positive total returns in that time. Indeed of the 41assets inour sample, 38have seen a positive return in USD
        terms. You¡¯ll find the link tothe report in your inbox this morning. If not, email us for a copy.<br/><br/>
        German Equities - Weekly Fund Flows - Andreas Bruckner<br/><br/>
        Last week¡¯s (Wed-Wed) review of funds¡¯ in/outflows as % of funds¡¯ AuM.Last week, investors committed more than
        $2billion of fresh money to totalreturn bond funds, which encompass a broad range of bond classes fromsovereign
        bund funds to corporate bonds. This was the largest weekly inflowfor the fund class in more than two years,
        buoyed by the pick of Powell,a relatively dovish candidate for the Federal Reserve chair. Investor appetitefor
        broad-based exposures could also be observed in the equity fund space,where diversified global equity funds
        trumped country-specific mandates. Withindeveloped markets, European and US equity funds suffered marginal
        outflowsfor the week, which for Europe meant first outflows in two months. Interestinglyhowever is the fact that
        actively managed equity funds in Europe have seenaround $10billion of steady inflows over the past six months,
        after what had been11/2years of continuous outflows. This has been a European phenomenon asactive flows into
        other major regions have continued trending lower.</p>
