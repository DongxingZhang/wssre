        YTD (thru September), copper production rose 9.3% YoY in the DemocraticRepublic of Congo (DRC) to 831kt. Cobalt
        production rose 18% to 59kt andgold output rose 5.7% YoY to 23t. While rising production is expected to easethe
        country¡¯s economic crisis, the central bank warned that inflation could riseto as high as 76% if monetary
        policies are relaxed. Congo¡¯s mining sectoraccounts for 95% of export revenues. Separately, Chinese delegates at
        a recentindustry conference said China is over-reliant on DRC for cobalt, should takesteps to ensure security of
        supply and consider upstream cobalt investments inCanada and Australia. (Reuters).<br/><br/>
        India¡¯s gold imports slump 31% YoY to 67 tons in October. This would bringYTD (thru October) imports to 777 tons
        (+91% YoY). Shipments rose this yearmainly due to an increase in purchases before the implementation of a new
        taxregime. Also, buyers took advantage of bilateral duty-free trade agreements,which led to an increase in
        purchases. High inventories, coupled with lowdomestic demand has led to easing in overseas purchases. However,
        theupcoming wedding season could boost demand. (Bloomberg Finance LP,Mining.com).<br/><br/>
