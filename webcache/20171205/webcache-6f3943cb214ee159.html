    <p> Monday: Israel will issue four bonds this Monday: three fixed bonds (Jan-21 - ILS 200mn, Nov-22 - 200mn &amp;
        Mar-27 - 200mn) and one floating bond (May-26 - 200mn). Valuation for fixed bonds: Despite recent weakness in
        rates, local bonds remain reasonably well supported. Hence ASW-spreads are - in contrary to many other EM
        countries - at historically tight levels right now. We still see value in hybrid flatteners and therefore
        continue to recommend 10Y bonds (Mar-27) vs 2Y IRS payers. Among bonds offered, Mar-27 is trading in line with
        its fair value but looks more attractive than Oct-26 (3bp rich). Jan-21 is 2bp rich, while Nov-22 is 3bp cheap
        and our preferred bon the belly of the curve. On the curve we also like Mar-24 and Aug-25 while we find Apr-21
        and Jan-42 expensive.<br/><br/>
        Monday: Romania has scheduled a bond auction for Monday (Oct-20 - RON 300mn). Although last week¡¯s auction was
        in contrary to the previous weeks not cancelled, the demand was once again very weak indicating investors¡¯
        concerns on the fiscal outlook for next year. Valuation for fixed bonds: We find long-end bonds attractive on
        valuation; however, we recommend hedging any position with short-end XCCY vs EUR given the upcoming increase in
        inflation pressure in combination with the expected aggressive hiking cycle by the NBR. The bond on offer
        (Oct-20) is among the most expensive bonds on the curve being 8bp rich. We see more value in Apr-20 or Jun-21,
        both trading cheap vs fair value and the trading range over the last six months. In the long-end, Apr-23 looks
        cheap while Feb-25 particularly expensive on the back of the recent outperformance. Our preferred bond in the
        long-end, July-27, is trading in line with its fair value and has been the most resilient in the recent selloff.<br/><br/>
        Tuesday / Friday: As in any other week, South Africa will issue fixed bonds on Tuesday followed by I/L-bonds on
        Friday. In fixed bonds, South Africa will issue R186 (ZAR 800mn), R2030 (800mn), R2040 (850mn) and R2044
        (850mn). In linkers, South Africa will most likely issue I2029, I2033, I2046 (900mn in total). Despite the
        increased issuance amount on offer and uncertainty regarding the downgrade, demand was once again strong at last
        week¡¯s auction with high B/Cs, particularly for R2040 (4.8 vs YTD avg at 3.9) and R2048 (3.8 vs 3.3). Also,
        demand for R2044 and R2030 was in line with the YTD avg. Valuation for fixed bonds: From a strategy view, we
        remain on the side-line going into the risk event and recommend short-end IRS receivers or IRS steepeners. Among
        bonds, we find from risk-reward the short-end and belly of the curve the most attractive (R208, R186, R2035)
        given increased term-premium compared to the very long-end. In terms of valuation for bonds on offer, R186 is
        3bp rich vs fair value, however, it is trading 2bp cheap compared to the average richness over the last six
        months. This makes the bond attractive (2bp pickup). R2030 is 6bp cheap vs fair value but has been trading 6bp
        cheap on average over the last six months- which reduces the attractiveness. R2040 is currently 9bp but also in
        line with the cheapness seen over the last six months. Nevertheless, we find this bond more attractive than
        R214, however, a touch less attractive than R2037. R2044 is currently 3bp cheap vs fair value and significantly
        more attractive than R2048 which is trading 7bp rich vs fair value.</p>
