    <p> Stay positive on the sector after the trip; our top pick remains Nexteer<br/><br/>
        We visited some auto part companies in Ningbo last week and walked away witha positive outlook for the China
        auto parts sector for 4Q17-2018E. We believethe production momentum at these companies remains solid and that
        new orderintakes are tracking ahead of expectations. Nexteer remains our top pick in thespace and we maintain
        Buy ratings on Minth, Huayu and Tuopu.<br/><br/>
        Minth - solid execution and margin outlook; new orders on track<br/><br/>
        Management maintained full-year revenue and margin guidance and mentionedthat gross margins for Mexico and
        Huai'an plants have been improving steadily.Revenue contribution from aluminum products continued to increase in
        2H17from 23-24% in 1H17and it has already achieved its full-year new orders targetof RMB4.5bn. Management
        estimated that the impact from raw material pricefluctuation is less than 1ppt and is under control through mix
        and utilization.<br/><br/>
        Tuopu - temporary margin weakness in 3Q17likely won't deter growth<br/><br/>
        Tuopu's 3Q17margin weakness was due mainly to increasing production costsamid government environmental checks in
        Aug-Sep and increases in raw materialprices. Management commented that it went back to normal in 4Q17and
        thecompany saw robust volume growth given strong sales at Geely, one of its majorOEM customers. According to
        Tuopu, it booked RMB760m revenue from Geelyin 2016and expects to double that amount this year. The company is
        road testingits IBS product and plans mass production in late 2018.<br/><br/>
        Joyson Electronics - active safety products gaining stream<br/><br/>
        The company reiterated its 2021revenue target of USD10bn with 70% fromKSS, 25% from auto electronics and the
        remaining 5% from decorative parts.It recorded USD130m of new orders for active safety products (front-view
        andsurround-view cameras) in 1H17(2016: USD120m). They expect to start massproduction of front-view cameras in
        2H17for NextEV ES8SUV and Lynk 01SUV.<br/><br/>
        Lifting earnings and TPs amid robust volume and new orders; risks<br/><br/>
        We use P/E to value the parts suppliers under our coverage (page 4). We raisevaluation multiples for Nexteer,
        Minth and Huayu by reference to relative multiplesand growth for HSI and CSI300index. Cross-checks with DCF
        models alsosuggest an increase in our terminal growth assumption from 1% to 2% to arriveat new target prices,
        which we think is reasonable given clear growth potential from ADAS. Downside risks: weaker-than-expected auto
        sales and raw materialprice volatility.</p>
