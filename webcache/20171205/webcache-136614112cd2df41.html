    <p> Broad money supply (M2) growth slowed to 10.6% yoy in October 2017 at IDR5,283.3tn(September at 10.9%). The
        slowdown in M2¡¯s growth was mainly due to the contraction ofthe central government¡¯s financial operation and the
        slower grwoth in net foreign assets. Thecontraction of the former was reflected in the increase of Bank
        Indonesia¡¯s (BI) liabilities to thecentral government, which has turned to a positive growth of 9.8% yoy in
        October from -0.3%in September 2017 while net foreign asset¡¯s growth slowed from 20.5% yoy in September to18.1%
        in October 2017. On the other hand, credit disbursement grew 8.0% yoy in October 2017(IDR4,588.5tn), slightly
        faster than September¡¯s 7.7% pace. This is consistent with BI¡¯s recentrevision that credit growth is likely to
        only reach around 8.0% growth for 2017 while graduallyexpected to accelerate to a range of 9-11% next year.<br/><br/>
        Reflecting the continued transmission of monetary policy easing, loan and time deposit interestrates again
        declined in October 2017, according to BI. The average lending rate was 11.55%(down 5 basis points from the
        previous month) and similarly, time deposit interest rates withtenors of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months were averaging at
        5.89%, 6.32%, 6.74% and 6.93% respectively,down from the previous month¡¯s level of 6.09%, 6.46%, 6.80% and
        6.99%.</p>
