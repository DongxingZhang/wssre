    <p> Quiet Golden Week, followed by high-end GGR recovery<br/><br/>
        Oct GGR came to the higher end of market expectation of 13-17% YoYgrowth. We estimate Oct GGR in VIP segment to
        have grown 30% YoY, andmass GGR to record 13% YoY. Oct Golden Week was good but did not reachthe level to
        surprise the market. However, GGR started picking up in lateOctober after 19th National Congress was held; the
        sequential improvementin late October could have been mostly driven by high-rollers¡¯ business.<br/><br/>
        Full year GGR to grow 19% YoY<br/><br/>
        We expect Nov GGR to record similar YoY growth of 18% YoY: mass is likelyto continue growing at a stable pace,
        while we think upside GGR projectionis coming from VIP and premium mass sides. We expect GGR YoY growthto be 20%
        in 4Q17E from 13%/22%/22% in 1Q/2Q/3Q17.<br/><br/>
        Sector has seen recovery lately but no big upside<br/><br/>
        The sector is currently trading at 24x FY18E P/E and 14x EV/EBITDA, in linewith their 5-year averages. There was
        some profit-taking in Oct due to themarket concern on slowing GGR growth. While sharp pick-up in late Oct
        hasprovided some recovery to the sector¡¯s performance, we believe overallsentiment has stayed neutral by now.
        Among Macau names, we believeMelco Resorts is likely to outperform its peers, given desirable 3Q17E resultsand
        its undemanding valuation.</p>
