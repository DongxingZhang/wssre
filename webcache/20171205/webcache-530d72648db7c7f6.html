        The October euro area composite PMI came in slightly down from the Septemberlevel but at a still solid level
        (56.0Oct vs 55.9Oct flash, 56.7Sep). Manufacturingstrength continues to compensate for the weaker momentum in
        services. Inputand output price sub-indices are still maintaining their gradual climb upwards.<br/><br/>

        The Sicily regional election on Sunday (5Nov) was the last electoral test beforenext spring national elections
        in Italy. The latest projections suggest the centrerightcandidate finishing just ahead of the candidate of the
        Five Star Movementwith the centre-left in a distant third place. Although this is largely in line withprevious
        opinion polls, the reaction of the centre-right to its success (if this isconfirmed in the official result) and
        of the centre-left to their weak performancewill be interesting to see. The coalition formation for the regional
        assembly inSicily might also give some colour on what dynamics we could see after thenational vote, expected in
        four months time.<br/><br/>

        In this report, we assess the longer-term correlations between EM currenciesand local assets, namely equities
        and debt. This enables us to identify which EMcurrencies are more linked to equities, which are more linked to
        debt, and whichhave limited or large exposure to both.We find that TRY, MXN, BRL and COP havea strong
        relationship with both local debt and equities, rallying when equities riseor bond yields fall (Figures 1, 2and
        3). On the other hand, ILS, CZK, CNY and RONhave limited exposure to local asset movements ¨C correlations
        between FX andequities/bonds are relatively small.</p>
