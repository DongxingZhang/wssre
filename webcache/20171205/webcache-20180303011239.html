    <p> The final 3Q growth rate for China's industrial automation (IA) demand, despite ahigher base, came in at 15% YoY
        (vs. preliminary number: +14%), an accelerationfrom 11%/12% in 1Q/2Q. The majority of downstream verticals
        recorded doubledigitgrowth. More importantly, since 4Q16, we are seeing more evidenceto suggest that China's
        manufacturing upgrades have become broad-based.<br/><br/>
        Machine tools, which is a leading vertical for most manufacturing sectors, haswitnessed accelerating demand for
        IA (+18% YoY in 3Q vs. 16% in 1Q/2Q17 vs.<br/><br/>
        -8%/+11% in 3Q/4Q16) and traditional verticals like textile machinery (+19% YoY)and metallurgy (+13% YoY) also
        sustained strong growth momentum in 3Q.<br/><br/>
        Growth of OEM market accelerated to 19% in 3Q (vs. +16% in 2Q) as automationupgrades further picked up steam in
        the equipment manufacturing industry.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, the project market turned to double-digit growth in 3Q (+11%YoY vs. +8% in 3Q), mainly driven by
        municipals, metallurgy, public facilitiesand automotive. The majority of verticals recorded double-digit growth
        in 3Q,suggesting the acceleration in automation upgrades is now across the board.</p>
