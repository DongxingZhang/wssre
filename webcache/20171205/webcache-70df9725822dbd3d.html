        US inflation - As calendars clicked into December bringing the holiday seasoninto view, further cheer was added
        when third-quarter economic output wasbumped up one-tenth this week to 3.3per cent. Yet while the American
        economysteams ahead, prices refuse to catch up. Core inflation remains at 1.4per cent,comfortably below the
        Fed¡¯s two per cent target. Enter Marvin Goodfriend, thenew nominee to the Fed¡¯s board. He believes the inflation
        target should beofficially codified in the Fed¡¯s Congressional mandate. That might imply a moredovish leaning
        than the succession of interest rate rises planned for the next twoyears. In turn, that may help consumers feel
        better about life. Last quarter, theirspending growth of 2.3per cent was down a third on the previous period
        justas business inventories jumped. The holiday shopping season can¡¯t come soonenough.</p>
