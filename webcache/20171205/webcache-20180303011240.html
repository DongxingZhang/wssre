    <p> Cosco's H reacted positively on its A share placement announced last night.<br/><br/>
        Our quick calculations show that this placement can potentially lower its P/B (asmeasured by H share) to 1.5x
        (from current 1.9x). Clearly, this still looks expensivein light of worsening sector fundamentals and potential
        loss-making of Coscoahead. More importantly, this placement has long been anticipated by the market,hence we
        would argue that most positives probably have already been reflectedin its share price strength this year. With
        OOIL deal being announced previouslyand placement being released now, we expect fundamentals (instead of
        corporateactions) to prevail as a key driver for stock going forward. We remain bearish. Sell.<br/><br/>
        According to new regulations released by CSRC in February this year, the uplimitfor placement should not exceed
        20% of total shares. This means that the maximalsize of this placement would be RMB14.7bn (10.2bn shares x 20% x
        latest Ashare price of RMB7.2). Except its parent, which could participate, we expectother SOEs also to join,
        given on-going ownership reform in China. The proceedis likely to be used for paying newbuild orders, which
        Cosco has committed morethan RMB20bn over 2017-19. The approval might take as long as 6 months, inlinewith
        previous cases.</p>
