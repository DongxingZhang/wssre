    <p> Weaker life due to effect of Regulation No. 134<br/><br/>
        Life premium recorded a decline in Oct with yoy growth ranging from -28.5%to 27.0% (vs. 6.2% to 44.8% in Sept),
        most likely driven by the implementationof Regulation No.134starting 1Oct, which prohibits certain savings
        policies. Asthere was a rush to buy in Sept ahead of the change, a subsequent slowdown inOct should not come as
        a surprise. Ping An was the only life insurer seeing doubledigitgrowth of 27.0% yoy (note Ping An started to
        adopt Reg 134in June) withstrong FYP (ex-grp) growth at 30.7% (vs. 47.5% in Sept). P&amp;C; premium growthwas
        largely stable, ranging from 11.6% to 63.1% (vs. -9.6% to 20.9% in Sept), ledby Ch Taiping (+63.1%). We maintain
        our positive view on Chinese insurers andprefer life over P&amp;C.; Top picks: Ping An and NCI.<br/><br/>
        Life ¨C A decline not a surprise<br/><br/>
        Ping An led Oct growth at 27.0% yoy (vs. +34.8% in Sept), followed by ChinaLife at 6.6% (+37.3%), CPIC at 3.2%
        (+24.0%), Taiping at 0.8% (+29.4%), NCI at-4.5% (+44.8%) and PICC Group at -28.5% (+6.2%). Taiping Life¡¯s
        (ex-Pension)0.3% growth was driven by individual regular (+2.7%) and other channels regular(+38.4%), more than
        offsetting the weakness in bancassurance (-10.6%). In termsof 10M17, Ping An led at 34.9% yoy (vs. +35.5% in
        9M17), followed by CPIC at28.8% (+30.7%), Taiping at 25.7% (+27.6%), China Life at 19.0% (+19.6%), PICCGroup at

        P&amp;C; ¨C Steady growth<br/><br/>
        P&amp;C; premium growth remained steady in Oct, with underlying yoy growthranging from 11.6% to 63.1%. Taiping

        (+20.9%)driven by non-auto (+32.8%), CPIC at 11.6% (+12.3%), and PICC at 14.0%(+13.8%). On a YTD basis (ex-VAT

        (+19.0%),PICC at 14.7% (+14.8%) and CPIC at 11.8% (+11.8%).<br/><br/>
        Prefer life players with strong protection focus<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our positive view on the Chinese insurance sector, and believethe current valuation of 1.2x 2017E
        P/EV (assuming 4.0% long-term investmentreturn) for life insurers is low, given the sector's strong growth
        outlook. Weprefer insurers with a strong protection focus, and thus have Ping An and NCIas our Top Picks. We
        believe Ping An¡¯s strongest protection focus and superiorrisk management capabilities should justify a premium
        valuation, while concernson NCI¡¯s balance sheet risk may be overdone. We also have Buys on CPIC, ChTaiping, and
        China Life-H. Investment risks include significant investment marketweakness, asset quality risks, a sharp
        decline in bond yields and China¡¯s macrorisks.</p>
