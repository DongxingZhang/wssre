    <p> AI is going to help all: Autonomous driving, Duer OS, iQiyi and News feed.<br/><br/>
        We were invited to attend the Baidu World 2017 conference on November 16in Beijing. The theme this year was
        still AI (artificial intelligence). We werehappy to see a clearer roadmap on Baidu＊s AI strategy, in terms of
        synergieswith all business lines and in terms of monetization opportunities.<br/><br/>
        Autonomous driving 每 Apollo platform to help all OEM. Monetization from 2018.<br/><br/>
        This is the most important AI-specific business line for Baidu in the next fiveyears. According to our channel
        checks with OEMs, auto driving will likely rollout step by step from 2018. Some major millstones will likely
        start from 2020.<br/><br/>
        Technology support from internet companies with strong data accumulationand analysis capability are more than
        welcome by these OEMs. Baidu is goingto provide a comprehensive system to support these auto driving cars
        andcharge-service feeds based on some value-added services like HD map,security services, connection fees etc.
        The agreement signed with King Long,JAC etc will start from 2018 and should contribute meaningful revenue
        from2020 we estimate.<br/><br/>
        Duer OS 每 much more than just a smart speaker system.<br/><br/>
        Baidu announced its showcase products, Raven H, Raven R and Raven Q toillustrate what the system can do. We are
        excited about the adaptability andscalability of Duer OS. Raven H (with Duer OS 2.0) is a smart speaker
        whichincorporates multi Baidu services. This is a qualified speak and smart assistantfor users in living room.
        The Raven R (under research) system can add mobilityin Raven H and attract more user interactions. The Raven Q
        (under research) isthe ultimate form of Duer OS, which enables smart equipment to become arobot-like smart
        assistant. The robot can move around user＊s house andcoordinates smart equipment of various types to provide a
        smooth one-stopuser-friendly experience.<br/><br/>
        iQiyi 每 technology driven and self-produced content driven.<br/><br/>
        The Rap of China, a Chinese rap reality show by IQiyi produced phenomenalonline content this summer. iQiyi
        shared underlying AI technology used toproduce and distribute this content. Technology is already used to select
        keyhosts, produce short highlights, personalized recommendations andadvertising embed. We think the use of
        technology and the strong selfproducedcontent pipeline could help iQiyi reduce reliance on expensive
        toplinerevenue content and still keep user traction at the same time.<br/><br/>
        News feed 每 potential still underestimated.<br/><br/>
        Baidu mgmt said Mobile Baidu will deploy version 10 which betterincorporates short video and smart
        recommendations based on interest andsocial connections. We believe this business line can add more
        revenuemomentum in addition to pure search in 2018. The connection between MobileBaidu and other 27 Baidu
        services like iQiyi will help increase user time spentand monetization opportunities.</p>
