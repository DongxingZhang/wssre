    <p> After listening to Great Wall Motor's (GWM) post-3Q17 results conference call, wesee one positive in the near
        term for the company, as Q4 sales will be supportedby the ramp-up of WEY brand sales. Yet, the negatives that
        made the latest resultsso poor will still dominate, in our view. The painful impact of old models sufferingprice
        erosion should combine with the ever-increasing competition in the SUVsegment, and we have cut our already low
        FY17 estimates by a further 26.8%.<br/><br/>
        This translates to another YoY drop in quarterly earnings of 12% in 4Q17E.<br/><br/>
        Looking into FY18, there will be further gains from new model launches, whichshould add 1.5ppt to the gross
        profit margin, in our estimate. However, this willstill be a long way short of the 21%-plus level seen in
        FY10-16. This is becauseGWM would probably need to beef up expenses to keep its products competitive,and hence
        we reduce our FY18/19 net profit forecasts by 10.4-10.7%. Our newtarget price is cut by 11%, based on 7.0x FY18E
        P/E (unchanged), which is belowGreat Wall's historical H-share trading average, considering the lack of
        long-termEPS growth. We believe that our target multiple is justified, given a FY16-19Ethree-year EPS CAGR of
        -4%. Key upside risks are stronger-than-expected newmodel sales and a margin rebound.</p>
