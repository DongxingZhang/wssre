    <p> Will steel prices fall or keep their strength.<br/><br/>
        Steel equities continue to be volatile, driven by macro woes and commodity pricemovements. Although current spot
        conditions remain strong, we still forecastcost support to fade and, thus, European prices to fall (current spot
        conditionswould imply further significant earnings upgrades across the space). Our toppicks are: 1)
        ArcelorMittal, which looks attractive to us based on strong cash flow(7-12% FCF yield), valuation and additional
        upside optionality; and 2) Voestalpine,which we believe has more room for upgrades, generates strong underlying
        CF(9-10% FCF yield) and has a less volatile business model.<br/><br/>
