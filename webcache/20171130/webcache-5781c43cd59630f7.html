    <p> Domestic smartphone brands maintaining strong momentum While growth in the globalsmartphone market has
        plateaued, Chinese smartphone brands have maintained stronggrowth momentum. Domestic smartphone brands
        represented by Huawei, Oppo, Vivo andXiaomi maintained YoY volume growth of 20%-30% during 9M17, with the
        overall industrychain also maintaining relatively high growth.<br/><br/>
        Optical: leading manufacturers to be first to benefit from dual camera penetration andadoption of 3D sensing The
        technological entry barriers for the single camera module industryare not particularly high, and it is a typical
        capital and labor intensive industry. Dual camerademand has surged in 2017, causing the industry to become more
        technology intensive. In thedual camera market, only leading players have managed to maintain high shipment
        volumeswhile continuously optimizing their product structure. Their market shares are likely to expandfurther as
        the penetration rate of dual cameras increases at a quickening pace. Apple (AAPLUS) has taken the lead in
        offering 3D sensing in its devices, and the Chinese smartphoneindustry chain has started to follow this trend;
        leading manufacturers with an edge in technologyare likely to be the first to benefit. Handset cameras typically
        have a short innovation cycle andare set to benefit from the development of AR, VR and AI
        technologies.<br/><br/>
        Haptics: downstream fingerprint recognition demand still robust Driven by thepopularization of infinity
        smartphone displays, upcoming development of fingerprint recognitiontechnology might be seen in two key
        directions: in terms of fingerprint sensing, currently usedcapacitive scanners might be replaced by optical and
        ultrasonic scanners; in terms of theposition of the fingerprint scanner, the current external scanners might be
        turned into hiddenones. Although Apple has innovatively offered a Face ID function which does not use
        fingerprintrecognition, we believe that as the most natural way to unlock a smartphone, fingerprintrecognition
        is unlikely to be phased out in the medium term. Furthermore, if breakthroughs aremade regarding fingerprint
        recognition in infinity displays, the fingerprint recognition industrymight see a new phase of growth.<br/><br/>
        Acoustics: integrated hardware design might become a trend to improve userexperience Currently any attention to
        smartphone acoustic components is focused on soundquality and water proof features. While fulfilling smartphone
        manufacturers¡¯ needs, upstreamcomponent makers have also continued to push forward technological innovation,
        with MEMStechnology increasingly adopted in handsets¡¯ microphones, speakers and receivers; inaddition, the
        integrated design of acoustic, RF and haptic components is also likely to becomean industry trend going forward.<br/><br/>
        Casing: non-metallic materials to prevail in the age of 5G networks With the arrival of 5Gnetworks and the
        popularization of wireless charging, the development of smartphone casingmaterials is now subject to some new
        requirements. Glass and ceramics appear to be the bestsubstitutes so far with glass casing likely to take off
        first.<br/><br/>
        Investment highlights We suggest watching Sunny Optical (2382HK), Q Tech (1478HK),AAC Tech (2018HK), BYD
        Electronics (285HK) and Tongda Group (698HK) as they havefirst-tier domestic smartphone brands as key
        clients.<br/><br/>
        Key risks include lower-than-expected smartphone sales volume downstream, the failure forproduct price declines
        to be passed on to suppliers which might hurt companies¡¯ profitability,and Rmb exchange rate volatility.</p>
