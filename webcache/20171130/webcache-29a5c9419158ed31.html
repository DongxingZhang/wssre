    <p> The US Senate released its own conceptual proposal on tax reform, one week after the House draft bill; the key
        idea is still to reduce tax burden for both individuals and corporations, and encourage repatriation of US
        assets currently held abroad, inline with the House bill.<br/><br/>
        However, considerable differences can be observed regarding the individual income tax rates, the itemized
        deductions, the estate tax, the pass-through tax, the timing of corporate tax cut, the state and local tax
        deduction, and the details on international tax rules.<br/><br/>
        The House version of individual income tax cut, which reduced the income brackets from 7 to 4, distributes
        uneven benefits among income levels and biased towards the high income levels; while the Senate proposal,
        maintaining the 7 brackets, offered more benefit for the median and lower income earners.<br/><br/>
        Also, to simplify the tax code, the House bill repealed most of the itemized deductions. But such fine tuned tax
        measures, though complicated, were targeting specific groups of people; eliminating them will reduce the benefit
        or even increase the tax cost of these people.<br/><br/>
        To address burning issues on increased tax cost on new home owners, medical spending, and education, etc., the
        Senate proposal kept such itemized deductions.<br/><br/>
        The Senate bill also delayed the introduction of corporate tax cuts (from 35% to 20%) by one year, starting from
        Januaray 2019; the major concern here for the delay is the pressure on budget deficit.<br/><br/>
        . Both bills eliminated the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on individual and corporate; while the Senate bill
        completely repealed the state and local tax deduction, but the House bill left some deduction for local property
        tax.<br/><br/>
        For the international tax reform, both bills proposed a one-time taxation on foreign earnings kept off-shore.
        But the House boosted its tax rate, after House markup: 14% for liquid holdings and 7% for properties and
        equipment; while the Senate proposed a lower tax rate: 10% for liquid holdings and 5% for illiquid
        ones.<br/><br/>
        Overall, the Senate bill curbed the generosity on tax rate cuts, while retaining some tax credits to address the
        concerns of increased tax burdens for specific groups. In our view, the Senate proposal is less aggresidve and
        trying to scale back some of the imbalance in the tax reform offered by the House, which could make the plan
        more feasible to pass.<br/><br/>
        However, looking forward, challenges are still notable: 1) House and Senate need to work hard to reconcile the
        differences; 2) if the debt ceiling talk on Dec 9th cannot achieve a longer term resolution to incorporate the
        increase deficit, ongoing efforts to implement tax reform may be impacted; 3) although the current budget
        reconciliation process enbales the bill to be passed without Democratic votes, it still demands highly unified
        agreement from the Republican Party, especially for the Senate</p>
