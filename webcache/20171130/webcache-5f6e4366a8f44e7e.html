    <p> Policy Address hints at more clarity on concession bidding process by mid-2018.<br/><br/>
        Macau's Chief Executive has delivered the 2018 Policy Address. As in previousyears, he urged gaming operators to
        diversify and to support local SMEs. But thisyear, he also highlighted the need to review the legislative
        framework regardingthe gaming concession bidding process. After speaking to legislative experts,we believe it
        will take Macau's Legislative Assembly 12-24 months to debate,vote and pass the new laws governing the next
        gaming concessions. If thisdrags beyond SJM/MGM's concession expiry in March 2020, then Macau's nextChief
        Executive, to be elected in Dec 2019, may extend the current concessions,providing time for the legislative
        process to finish. Click Fig 1 to see the timelineof the previous gaming concession legislative process in

        Tighter junket regulations have little impact on VIP GGR, in our view.<br/><br/>
        At a gaming conference, the Head of Gaming Bureau (DICJ) said the regulatorplans to lift standards for junket
        operators beginning in January when they submittheir licenses for annual renewal. This may include closer
        monitoring of junkets'credit records and of the practice of taking temporary deposits from unqualifiedlocal
        citizens. We believe such regulations would have little impact on VIP GGRin 2018. Over the past 3 years,
        consolidation has left the Top 5 junkets controllingover 85% of the VIP market. These Top 5 junkets have strong
        balance sheets andare likely to be better at coping with regulations (Fig 3). Indeed, we expect thenew wave of
        junket room opening to support VIP GGR in 2018 (Fig 4).<br/><br/>
        Greater Bay Area initiative to improve Macau's infrastructures.<br/><br/>
        As part of his policy address, Macau's Chief Executive highlighted theopportunities brought about by the Central
        Government's "Guangdong-HKMacauGreater Bay Area" initiative. The HK-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge will be aninstrumental
        project to provide long-term visitor growth. The 55-km bridge canshorten travel time between HK and Macau from 1
        hour by ferry to 30 min byroad, and buses can run as frequently as every 5 minutes during peak hours(vs existing
        ferry schedule every 15 minutes). We believe the portion connectingZhuhai to Macau may start operations by early
        2018, but the portion connectingHK to Macau may not open until late 2018. We lift our forecast of Macau's
        longtermvisitor growth from 2% CAGR in 2012-16 to 7.5% CAGR in 2017-20 (Fig 8).<br/><br/>
        Free cash flow yield attractive for Wynn Macau; key risks.<br/><br/>
        We maintain our above-consensus 2018 GGR forecast of 13% (vs consensus 9%)as strong junket liquidity should keep
        VIP growth solidly at 15% (vs consensus VIPGGR +8%). We reiterate Wynn Macau (Buy) as our top pick given what we
        see as an attractive 7% 2018F FCF yield. Macau stocks are trading at 14.0x DB 2018Efwd EV/EBITDA, at +1 standard
        deviation over the historical average. We viewcurrent valuation as reasonable in an upcycle. We value Macau
        stocks on SOTP.<br/><br/>
        Downside risks include a sharp slowdown in GGR momentum and regulatorychanges. Upside risks include
        faster-than-expected GGR growth in 2018.</p>
