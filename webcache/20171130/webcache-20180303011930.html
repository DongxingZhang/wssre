    <p> The KOSPI is likely to find its 2017close at mid-2500, and could maintain itsmomentum at least until 1H18. Good
        global growth, a structural rally in the ITsector, signs of improving domestic demand, and supportive policies
        ahead ofthe election in Jun ¡¯18could help. This implies the Kospi beat our previousexpectation of a strong 1H17,
        followed by a slower 4Q17. We set our midtermKOSPI target at 2800(10.5x 18E P/E and 1.15x P/B).</p>
