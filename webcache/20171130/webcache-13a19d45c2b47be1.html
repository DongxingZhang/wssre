    <p> One catalyst comes true, gaining duty free business in SH, ahead ofexpectation<br/><br/>
        We view this event positively and believe its timeline is ahead of our expectation.We believe the launch of
        working with Sunrise will follow the same pattern as thatof the Sunrise Beijing acquisition. CITS acquired a 51%
        share of Sunrise Beijingfirst in the middle of this year. CITS and Sunrise Beijing successfully won thebidding
        of duty free operation of Terminal 2and Terminal 3of Beijing InternationalAirport, respectively.<br/><br/>
        The total duty free sales of Shanghai airports (both Hongqiao and Pudong)should be larger than Beijing Airport.
        Currently, it's still at a preliminary stage ofcooperation. We believe the key factor here is whether the
        concessionaire ratepaid to Shanghai airports will be as high as those at Beijing Airport.</p>
