    <p> Will steel prices fall or keep their strength.<br/><br/>
        Steel equities continue to be volatile, driven by macro woes and commodity pricemovements. Although current spot
        conditions remain strong, we still forecastcost support to fade and, thus, European prices to fall (current spot
        conditionswould imply further significant earnings upgrades across the space). Our top picksare: 1)
        ArcelorMittal, which looks attractive to us based on: strong cash flow(7-12% FCF yield), valuation and
        additional upside optionality, and 2) Voestalpine,which we believe has more room for upgrades, generates strong
        underlying CF(9-10% FCF yield) and has a less volatile business model.<br/><br/>
