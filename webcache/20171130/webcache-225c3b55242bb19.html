    <p> Restocking cycle to continue; revising up TP to Rmb745.<br/><br/>
        We estimate Moutai¡¯s current channel inventory equals six months of Moutai'sreal consumption, indicating there
        is still room for distributors and high-wealthindividuals to fill up their warehouses. More importantly, this
        would leavemanagement time to deal with the channel stocking problem. Meanwhile, weidentify three possible
        catalysts that might trigger channel de-stocking, andbefore these catalysts are triggered, we expect less risk
        of a strong de-stocking.<br/><br/>
        We are revising up Moutai¡¯s TP to Rmb745 and we maintain Buy.<br/><br/>
        Current channel inventory equals six months of real consumption.<br/><br/>
        We think Moutai¡¯s strong sales recovery from 2016 has been mainly driven byboth channel restocking and a
        consumption upgrade. Therefore, it is importantfor investors to gauge the water line in the channels. Based on
        historical channelinventory movement, Moutai¡¯s ex-factory supply, and Moutai¡¯s real consumptionpattern, we
        estimate that currently there are 12,000 tons of Moutai in distributors'and investors' warehouses, representing
        six months of real consumption in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Compared with the peak level of 12 months in 2012, this implies there is roomfor channels to stock up (Figure
        1).<br/><br/>
        Three catalysts that could trigger channel de-stocking in next 12 months.<br/><br/>
        Distributors are building up channel stocking because they expect the retail priceto continue to go up.
        Therefore, whenever such an expectation weakens, thecycle could turn from restocking to de-stocking. We identify
        three events thatmight lead to weakened expectation: 1) Moutai strictly implements a fixed pricee-commerce
        policy; 2) Moutai raises its ex-factory price at an inappropriate time;and 3) the retail price rises to Rmb2000
        suddenly, which is the peak level in the lastcycle. Before these catalysts happen, we believe risk-reward
        remains attractivefor a Buy on the stock.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining Buy.<br/><br/>
        Moutai's management is undertaking several measures, including implementingprice guidance, increasing supply and
        implementing an e-commerce policy, tostabilize the retail price. We expect these measures to push distributors
        to releasechannel inventory gradually (instead of suddenly). We are revising up our TP toRmb745 based on the DCF
        method (factoring in 9.5% WACC and 2% TG). Wereiterate Buy. Downside risk: sudden channel de-stocking.</p>
