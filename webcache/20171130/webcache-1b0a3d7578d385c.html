    <p> Primary residential sales area dropped 21% YoY in second week of Nov Accordingto Soufun data on 26major cities
        in China, primary residential sales area continued todrop in the second week of Nov, falling 21% YoY and 10%
        WoW. This ongoing declinein residential GFA sold is in line with our previous forecast for a new
        down-cycle.<br/><br/>
        Restrictive policies to continue; declining contract sales ahead Due to ongoingrestrictive policies,
        rapidly-rising land prices and a cyclically high contract sales basefigure in 2017YTD, we expect most China
        developers to post a decline in contract salesin 2018. We see limited catalysts for the sector.<br/><br/>
