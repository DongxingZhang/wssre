    <p> On 14 Nov 2017, China’s FDA (CFDA) (国家食品药品监督管理总局) drafted aconsultation paper on the surveillance and management
        of internet sales formedicines. This requires the relevant parties to reply the CFDA by 30 Nov 2017.<br/><br/>
        In the consultation paper’s chapter 2 of item #8, if the on-line medicines sellers arethose drug-makers or
        wholesalers, drug products are restricted not to be sold toindividual customers (patients). At the same time,
        prescription medicines or drugswith special requirement from government cannot be sold on internet, if
        thesellers are on-line drugstore chain companies.<br/><br/>
        The same chapter of item #9 stressed that, on-line medicine sales from theseenterprises should emphasize on (1)
        the needs and safety guarantee of theirsoftware applications, internet security and database system; (2)
        establishing moresafety management measures for on-line drug sales; (3) ensuring the quality anddistribution
        accuracy of these medicines to their customers; (4) setting up a systemfor customers to complain which protects
        their rights; and (5) having thesurveillance report available for the side effects of these drugs to be sold
        on-line.<br/><br/>
        As we flagged in our 26 Feb 2016 note, consistent with government policy ofsupplying cheaper medicines to
        Chinese masses safely, we reckon that, the currentdevelopment would (1) enforce and improve the existing
        surveillance system foron-line drug sales; and (2) ensure accurate delivery to the end-users
        (customers)especially for prescription drugs. Note that, only the over-the-counter drugs andhealth supplement
        are officially allowed to sell on-line.<br/><br/>
        HK stock impact: This development will likely limit the amount and type ofmedicines to be sold on-line, for
        instance prescription drugs. HK-listed stock thatmostly involves in this matter would be Ali Health (241.HK,
        Non-rated). In 3/FY17,its 54% of profit was derived from drug sales through e-commerce platform suchas Tmall to
        customers, while the rest of its profit (46% of total) was from drugtracking platform services to customers. The
        former business includes on-line drugsales to offline collection points, whose coverage is over 20,000 pharmacy
        outletsin more than 100 cities of China (also associated with 200 offline drugstore chains).<br/><br/>
        Whereas the tracking system service had a much wider gross margin at 89.6% in3/FY17 compared to the on-line drug
        sales of a mere 26.7%.<br/><br/>
        On the other hand, during 3/FY17, Ali Health already carried out a properoperation of its Drug PIATS* (an
        electronic identification and tracker system fordrugs). In addition, the company also launched its Ma Shang Fang
        Xin (码上放心)tracking platform. This comprehensive platform helps (1) drug-makers establishtheir product tracking
        systems as required by the CFDA and (2) realize qualityassurance and marketing control for both the drug-makers
        and the middlemenamong the supply chain. Same as our previous note, we re-iterate our view thatthe government
        will likely introduce a more elegant and cheaper on-lineverification system, without any significant markup
        charges and data disclosurerisk from a third party system operator (such as Ali Health) to other drug retailers.<br/><br/>
        *The Drug PIATS stands for the Drug Product Identification, Authentication andTracking System. Each medicine
        should be assigned with an electronic monitoringcode to identify itself for real-time monitoring in hospitals’
        or drugstores’ purchase.</p>
