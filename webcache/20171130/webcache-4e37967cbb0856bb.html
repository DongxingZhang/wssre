    <p> Lithium Supply/Demand, pricing and battery technology shifts most topical<br/><br/>
        We hosted our second annual Lithium Supply Chain and Energy StorageConference in NYC with strong attendance.
        Interest in the thematic continuesto build, primarily driven by ongoing shifts in the lithium-ion battery
        demandprofile e.g. Tesla¡¯s electric semi announced after-market. Presentingcompanies included Albemarle, FMC,
        Orocobre, Ganfeng Lithium, LithiumAmericas, Galaxy, Nemaska Lithium, Syrah Resources and Cobalt 27.
        Centraltopics: 1) lithium supply/demand balance and the current tight market, 2)technology changes within
        batteries and the growing preference for hydroxidevs carbonate, 3) the importance of China¡¯s push into EVs, 4)
        likely industryconsolidation/M&amp;A;/partnerships, and 5) a debate on lithium as a commodity vsspecialty
        chemical. Companies remain bullish on lithium pricing with a view ofsupply disappointments and continue to
        highlight product quality differences.Our recent China feedback and Global Lithium Supply/Demand reports
        providemore detailed views on some of these topics.<br/><br/>
        Supply/Demand balance ¨C companies see balanced-to-tight going forward<br/><br/>
        Most companies expect demand to build out with a view of at least 10years ofgrowth for lithium-ion batteries.
        This is led by China¡¯s goal of 2m EVs in 2020and a c.25% EV market share target by 2025. Subsidies may be
        reduced inforward years as economics improve. Against this backdrop, most companiesbelieve that a lack of
        industry-wide expertise, technical setbacks and morestringent environmental standards for processors in China
        could result insupply disappointments. Additionally the challenges of processing spodumeneconcentrate below the
        industry standard 6% was mentioned. Challenges inChinese domestic brine supply such as altitude, colder weather
        andmagnesium levels were discussed. Most companies discussed plans for furthergreenfield/brownfield additions to
        bridge the gap. Clay options in Nevada areundergoing further R&amp;D;/feasibility work to determine
        viability.<br/><br/>
        Technology ¨C moving to higher nickel and hydroxide<br/><br/>
        China continues to shift technology towards Nickel Cobalt Manganese (NCM)cathodes (typically c.25% battery
        cost), while other Japanese and SouthKorean battery-makers prefer Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) with
        bothtechnologies offering greater energy density upside vs alternative cathodes.We discussed the different forms
        of NCM with most battery-makers planningto use 622cathodes in coming years and then 811beyond 2020. This
        shouldstill be positive for the cobalt market as total units sold should offset anyreduction in intensity.
        Lithium hydroxide is growing in importance according tomost companies, linked to NCA and higher nickel content
        within NCMcathodes. Within the anode (typically c.7% battery cost), the industry currentlyis split
        c.50/50synthetic/natural graphite with low amounts of silicon (4-6%).</p>
