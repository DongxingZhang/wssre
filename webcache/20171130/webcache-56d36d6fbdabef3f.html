    <p> Commentary for Monday: The upcoming holiday-shortened week will be ratherlight in terms of data and Fedspeak. As
        a reminder, all US markets are closed onThursday for Thanksgiving and there are no major data releases on
        Friday. Taxreform progress will likely resume next week with the full Senate expected tovote on their version of
        tax reform once lawmakers return from the Thanksgivingbreak. That said, since both the Senate and House will
        return to their variousdistricts this week for a designated district work period¡ªthe degree to which
        theirconstituencies express enthusiasm/concern regarding tax reform will set the toneof the debate going
        forward.<br/><br/>
        Regarding the data, the appropriately-named index of leading economicindicators (1.3% forecast vs. -0.2%
        previously) kicks off the week on Monday. Theprojected jump in the LEI is largely due to initial jobless claims
        as the hurricanerelatedspike in September reversed in October. The elevated level of ISM neworders should also
        be a positive contributor to the series. If our forecast provesprescient, the year-over-year growth rate of the
        LEI would rise a little over apercentage point to 5.1%, the highest since May 2015(5.2%). However, while
        theeconomy entered a soft patch over the back of 2015/early 2016, we still expectabove trend growth over the
        next several quarters. For an expansive discussionof our economic and financial outlook, please see the latest
        US EconomicsPerspectives.1<br/><br/>
        On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) will release Octoberexisting home sales (5.40million vs.
        5.39million). As a side note, the NARhas come out against the tax reform bill as currently envisioned in the
        House.Pending home sales, which lead existing by a month were flat in September,hence we expect little change in
        the existing sales series. However, consumerattitudes remain buoyant and we expect this to be reflected in the
        final Novemberconsumer sentiment print (101.0vs 100.7) released on Monday. This shouldprovide support for
        further grinding improvement in residential investment, but,as we have recently noted, the trends in housing
        have been soft of late. Ourforecast for October existing sales implies a slight year-over-year decline in
        theseries. Note that in Q3, housing starts were up only 1.2% compared to the sameperiod a year ago, permits were
        up just 2.2% and existing sales were up around0.2%.</p>
