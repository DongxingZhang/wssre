    <p> We interviewed some industry experts this week on trends in China¡¯s property market.<br/><br/>
        Key takeaways below.<br/><br/>
        Residential GFA sold to decline in 2018 Most of the experts we spoke with expectrestrictive policies to continue
        in 2018. Third and fourth-tier cities currently account for60-65% of total residential GFA sold in China. Given
        the relatively high sales base in9M17, most experts believe residential GFA sold in third and fourth-tier cities
        will drop10-20% YoY in 2018, whereas due to a low sales base in 2017, they expect residentialGFA sold in first
        and second-tier cities to be flat YoY. Overall, they expect 2018residential GFA sold to drop 5-10% YoY in China.<br/><br/>
        Accelerating industry consolidation; industry leaders¡¯ contract sales to continueto rise in 2018 The top-ten
        China developers had a market share of around 16% in1H17, in terms of GFA sold. Most of the experts estimate
        this market share will increaseto 25-30% in 2018-22. They believe industry leaders¡¯ contract sales revenue
        willcontinue to rise by 10-20% in 2018, supported by abundant available-for-sale projectsand a fast sales cycle.<br/><br/>
        Land prices to continue to rise in 2018 given limited supply NBS data show thatduring 2013-17 the average land
        price rose at a CAGR of 18% due to the declining landsupply from local governments. For 2018, most experts
        believe prices will continue torise.<br/><br/>
        Flat ASP in 2018; declining gross margin Due to local government tightening policieson new home prices and
        rising land prices, most experts expect developers¡¯ grossmargins to drop in 2018, which may lead to poor
        earnings visibility in 2020.<br/><br/>
        Increasing rental housing supply may curb residential property prices Both thecentral and local governments are
        encouraging developers to increase supply of rentalhousing in overheated first and second-tier cities. Most
        experts believe rental housingsupply will account for 30% of total housing supply in China¡¯s big cities over the
        longrun, which may curb residential property prices.<br/><br/>
        Our comments: limited catalysts for China property stocks; 2018 to be achallenging year, especially for
        third-tier city developers¡¯ share prices We expectpolicies and contract sales performance to be the two main
        share price drivers for Chinaproperty stocks in 2018. Most stocks are trading in the middle/upper end of their
        2011-17 P/B ranges. With decelerating contract sales and gross margins ahead in 2018, wesee current valuations
        as relatively expensive. Thus, we suggest taking profit on mostChina property stocks.<br/><br/>
        2018 will be a challenging year for third-tier city developers¡¯ share price performance. Acase in point is
        COGO¡¯s share price performance during the 2014 down-cycle when dueto restrictive policies primary residential
        property sales in China dropped 9% YoY toRmb10.5trn, while the Hang Seng Index rose 1% to 23,605.<br/><br/>
        COGO (81 HK, Underperform) is a major third-tier city developer under industry leaderCOLI (688 HK, Buy). In
        2014, its contract sales revenue increased by 5% YoY toHK$18bn and revenue dropped 12% YoY to HK$14bn (97% of
        revenue was from thirdtiercities). Gross margin dropped by 900bps YoY to 24% and net earnings declined by60% YoY
        to HK$1.3bn. Due to its focus on third-tier cities and its poor financial results,its share price dropped from
        HK$7.30 (1.4x 2014 NBV) to HK$4.00 (0.7x2014 NBV) bythe end of the year.</p>
