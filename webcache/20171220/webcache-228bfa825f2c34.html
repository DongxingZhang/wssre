    <p> Yulin and Qinzhou markets appear resilient, with supportive credit policy<br/><br/>
        Last week we visited Yulin (”Ò¡÷) and Qinzhou (öJ÷›), both T4cities in Guangxiprovince, and projects by Evergrande,
        Country Garden and Aoyuan. The twocities painted a different picture to other buoyant property markets, with
        stablesales volume (0-10% y-y growth) and mild price appreciation (~5-10% y-y in2017but flat for a couple of
        years) amid decent inventory (6-12months). Whilemany T1/2cities are seeing credit tightening, first-home buyers
        in Qinzhou andYulin can still enjoy 20-25% downpayment (30-40% in most T1/2cities) andrelatively low mortgage
        rates at a 0-5% premium to the benchmark rate (vs.9% national average as of Nov).<br/><br/>
        Population outflow over past decade, but more migrant workers now returning<br/><br/>
        Although the permanent population increased slightly (by 2-4%) between 2005and 2015in Qinzhou (&gt;4mn in 2017)
        and Yulin (&gt;7mn in 2017), the citiesactually saw population outflows (~0.5m in Qinzhou and ~1m in Yulin) as
        moreof the labor force is now working in Guangdong or other developed areas.However, with T1/2cities adopting
        HPR policies amid soaring property prices,we see more and more migrant workers now returning to their hometown
        topurchase a new home, which accounts for about a third of the demand inthose cities. In addition, we see strong
        upgrade demand from local buyers asthey are now pursuing better products developed by national
        players.<br/><br/>
        Supportive credit policy, low property prices and healthy affordability<br/><br/>
        Overall property prices in Qinzhou and Yulin remain low at RMB4-4.5k/sqm(+5-10% y-y), vs. a national average of
        RMB7.9k as of Oct-17. Inventory ispretty healthy at ~6-12months (estimated by local managers). These two
        citieshave supportive credit policy with only 20-25% downpayment for first homes(most cities are now adopting
        30-40%). Local disposable income per capita is~RMB30k, implying that a family needs ~5years to purchase a home
        of100sqm. Therefore, we expect mild price appreciation over the next few years.<br/><br/>
        Further market consolidation with more big players entering low-tier markets<br/><br/>
        We have seen more big players enter lower tier markets in the past 12months,leveraging their stronger execution
        and better products. These developers canusually charge a 20-50% price premium over local players and still see
        a bettersell-through rate. For example, Aoyuan and Country Garden both achieved&gt;RMB1bn sales in Yulin in
        2017, more than a 20% market share. In the midterm,we believe these markets should be resilient given
        improvingurbanization (37.8%/47.3% in Qinzhou/Yulin in 2016), with more peoplemoving from county to city. We
        also expect market consolidation to continue,with more large developers entering the markets with better
        products.<br/><br/>
        Read through for major developers in China<br/><br/>
        Considering the big proportion of low-tier markets (T3and below account for60-65% of China°Øs property market in
        terms of sales volume), and long-termproperty trends (less land for sale in T1/2cities, but more for leasing),
        webelieve big developers targeting higher sales/market share will have to enterthese cities (even Sunac and
        Longfor, which target T1/2cities). Developerswith a good presence/track record in T3/4cities, such as Evergrande
        andCountry Garden, may have a relative advantage in scaling up. Other T3playerslike Future Land and Aoyuan
        should also benefit, as they know how tomaximize asset churn and limit costs in those cities with ASP at
        RMB4-6k/sqm.</p>
