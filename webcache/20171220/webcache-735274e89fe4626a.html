    <p> 11M17REI growth softened to 7.5% y-y<br/><br/>
        YTD REI for 11M17softened to 7.5% y-y (vs. 7.8% in 10M17) and YTDresidential REI was up 9.7% y-y (vs. 9.9% in
        10M17). However, we are seeingstrong rebound on new starts (+19% y-y in Nov vs. +6.9% YTD) and land sales(land
        sales value up +72% y-y in Nov (vs. +47% YTD), with volume growing at43% y-y in Nov (vs. 12.9% in 10M17). While
        YTD land sales value remainedhigh, inventory is still low, but with tighter credit. We continue to expect ~5%new
        starts and high single-digit REI growth for 2017.<br/><br/>
        National sales to soften on high base in December; listed developers couldcontinue to beat in 1Q18<br/><br/>
        In line with our expectation, property sales increased in Nov with volume up5.3% y-y (vs. -6.0% in Oct, YTD
        +7.9%) and value up 13.3% y-y (vs. -1.7% inOct, YTD +12.7%), mainly due to low base and delayed launches in
        Oct.However, we expect national sales growth to soften in Dec on high base &amp;tighter; credit (avg first-home
        mortgage rate of 5.4% by Nov vs. 4.5% in Dec2016). Listcos might delay contracting their sales to Jan like last
        year (most ofthem have achieved their 2017sales target). Therefore, we think the sales oflistcos will remain
        strong in 1Q18despite high base, considering the significantgrowth of their saleable resources and execution
        improvement.<br/><br/>
        Strong land sales, but still under supplied<br/><br/>
        Land area sold increased 43% y-y in Nov. (YTD of 16.3% vs. 12.9% in 10M17)and land value sold increased 72% y-y
        (YTD of 47% vs. 43% in 10M17).However, the 222m sqm land sales YTD is still 26-40% below 2011-2014level.With
        growth in new starts remaining low (+6.9% y-y in 11M17), we believeinventory is unlikely to pick up much in the
        short term (currently at 10/8/12months in T1/2/3cities, based on our estimates).<br/><br/>
        Recommendations and risks<br/><br/>
        We expect national sales volume to weaken in Dec (due to tighter credit &amp; highbase) and more divergence in
        listcos¡¯ sales growth, due to different strategies&amp; execution. We expect competition to remain fierce in
        T1/2cities in 2018(despite overall market possibly recovering), while listed T3-city players willconsolidate the
        low-tier market further. We suggest investors accumulatedevelopers with a strong execution record or abundant
        saleable resources,incl. Country Garden, Vanke, KWG, Future Land and Aoyuan. We value stocksusing NAV for
        existing projects. Key risks are further credit/policy tightening.</p>
