    <p> 3Q results of Kakao Bank and K-Bank reveal¡­: Kakao Bank and K-Bank postedrespective net losses KRW48.1b and KRW
        19.6b for 3Q, but the former¡¯s positivesindicate it should reach BEP faster than most forecasts, backed by sharp
        asset growth.<br/><br/>
        ¡­the former¡¯s outperformance: Kakao Bank¡¯s total loans hit KRW3.3t in 3Q, or 4.3xK-Bank¡¯s KRW768.9b, and given
        the former¡¯s loftier capital, we would expect it tomaintain an aggressive asset growth strategy.<br/><br/>
        Portfolio rebalancing to enhance NIM: K-Bank¡¯s NIM improved for the quarter asthe portion of mid-rate loans in
        its portfolio increased, and while the figure at Kakao Bankremains quite low¡ªas it has offered loans mainly to
        clients with high credit ratings¡ªweforesee it jumping as a rising portion of mid-rate loans spurs loan
        growth.<br/><br/>
        Fee losses inevitable while seeking economies of scale: Net fee losses seemunavoidable as banks seek to increase
        their customer base, but once it reaches a certainthreshold and the portion of internal transfers increases,
        commission fees from externaltransactions should gradually decline.<br/><br/>
        Limited G&amp;A; cost hikes: Kakao Bank and K-Bank reported respective G&amp;A; costs ofKRW25.5b and KRW20.5b
        for 3Q, implying approximate annual figures of KRW100b,even though the former¡¯s total assets of KRW4.1t dwarf
        the latter¡¯s KRW1.1t, with furtherasset growth therefore not expected to bring additional G&amp;A; cost
        hikes.<br/><br/>
        BEP prerequisite: Kakao Bank¡¯s 3Q results suggest it needs total assets of KRW10t toreach BEP, with the current
        pace of growth having us believe it will reach that pointsooner than most expect.<br/><br/>
        Investment points: Investors should focus on interest-rate hike led earningsimprovements by traditional players
        more than threats from the internet primary banks,with the 58% stake held by Korea Investment Holdings in Kakao
        Bank likely to bestow itwith a valuation premium as the latter approaches BEP.</p>
