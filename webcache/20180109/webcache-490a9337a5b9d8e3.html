    <p> 2018marks the tenth anniversary of the global financial crisis and the start of the great recession.On our
        forecasts, it is also expected to be the second year of the strongest global growth since theimmediate
        post-crisis bounce of 2010. This is excellent news as far as it goes, but in fact thelegacy of the crisis
        persists in many ways ¨C in the form of continued monetary stimulus virtuallyeverywhere, in the exuberance of
        property and financial markets (a direct consequence ofquantitative easing), in the rise of income inequality
        and the growth of populism.</p>
