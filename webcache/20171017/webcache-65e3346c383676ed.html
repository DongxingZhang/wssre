    <p> This report recaps key takeaways from our site visits to property projects inTier-1 city Shanghai, Tier-2 city
        Wuxi, and Tier-3 city Urumqi (capital ofXinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) last week. We visited projects
        ofestablished developers including Longfor, Evergrande, China Overseas andSunac, but also those from relatively
        new HY issuers like Guorui, Ronshine,and Xinhu Zhongbao. Overall, we expect good property sales in Sept and
        Octseason, as sell-through ratio should remain high and we enter a high propertysales season; furthermore,
        companies under our coverage should continue tofetch YoY contract sales growth above that of the nationwide
        figure. Shimaowas one of the first to announce Sept contract sales. It posted a strong Septcontract sales figure
        of RMB10.2bn, up 57% YoY. Please refer to the followingpages for pictures of some projects we visited. The
        project quality of Guoruiand Ronshine looks decent to us, though Guorui¡¯s Chongming Island projectlocation is in
        a more remote area of Chongming. We consider the design andlayouts of Xinhu Zhongbao¡¯s Shanghai project we
        visited to be well-thoughtout.</p>
