    <p> CPI decelerates further to 3.0% YoY in September, in line with our forecast.<br/><br/>
        Consumer prices fell for the second consecutive month, posting a 0.1% MoMdecline in September. This, along with
        a higher base, took the headline inflationdown by 0.3pps to an all-time low of 3.0% YoY, in line with our
        expectations.<br/><br/>
        Decline in inflation broad-based.<br/><br/>
        The decline in YoY inflation to an historic low was based on declines in both foodand non-food goods inflation
        while inflation in service costs increased slightly.<br/><br/>
        Food price inflation, which had seen a spike in June as bad weather conditionsaffected the prices of fruits and
        vegetables, has declined since then as the effect ofthe temporary supply-side shock seems to have begun to fade.
        Food inflation hasnow declined to 2.0% YoY in September, the lowest since May-12, with inflationin a number of
        components including oil, beans, sugar, fruits &amp; vegetables innegative territory. In the non-food category,
        increasing household demand has notyet affected inflation as production continues to keep pace with demand.
        Inflationin almost all major non-food categories have shown a decline in September. Alsoimportant to note that
        the increase in oil prices did not have any material impacton Russian inflation in September, while the slight
        strengthening of the rubleduring the month may have had a small impact on decelerating inflation. Coreinflation
        continued to soften in September with the ROSSTAT¡¯s measure decliningby 0.2pps to a historic low of 2.8%
        YoY.<br/><br/>
        We expect the disinflationary trend to continue with annual inflation now likelyto undershoot 3% YoY by
        year-end.<br/><br/>
        Headline inflation is likely to continue to decline on the back of falling foodinflation and base effects and we
        now expect it to reach 2.8% YoY by end-2017.<br/><br/>
        The spike in annual inflation in June due to supply-related effects on food priceinflation has proved to be
        temporary with food inflation back on a downwardtrend. A faster-than-expected recovery in domestic demand
        remains a risk toinflation, though the CBR has observed that the disinflationary effect of increasingdomestic
        demand has declined. Risk also stems from inflation expectations whichcontinues to be volatile in September,
        increasing slightly to 9.6%. The CBR hasrepeatedly expressed concern about inflation expectations not anchoring
        (that is,it is high, volatile and reactive to transitory factors) and its impact on headlineinflation.</p>
