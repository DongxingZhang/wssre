        September Performance. The CGS Top 10 Monthly Portfolio registered a gain of 0.20% in September 2017,
        underperforming the CSI 300 Index by 0.17ppt. The Medium-term and Long-term Portfolios reported gains of 1.14%
        and 2.11%, outperforming the CSI 300 Index by 0.76ppt and 1.73ppts, respectively.<br/><br/>
        October Outlook. External markets may remain an important factor affecting A shares. The geopolitical
        development in North Korea and the South China Sea, the US President Donald Trump¡¯s trade protectionism and the
        fluctuation in RMB/USD exchange rates are all variables to consider. We expect the domestic economy to remain
        relatively stable in October, regulations on financial activities to further tighten and risk appetite to
        improve slightly. Monetary policy will remain prudent, and liquidity at the macro-level will likely be slightly
        tight. Fiscal policy and reforms will continue to have an impact. We expect a range bound trading pattern in the
        stock market. Investors should be aware of ¡°black swan¡± events.<br/><br/>
        Investment Portfolios: We establish three investment portfolios of different investment periods to cater for the
        various needs and risk preferences of investors.</p>
