    <p> We expect the NBP to keep its rates on hold at its October 2017 meeting.<br/><br/>
        While we anticipate well-known hawk MPC members (Mr. Gatnar, Dr. Hardtand Dr. Zubelewicz) to keep voicing their
        concerns about negative real interestrates, the marginal voter in the MPC may only start leaning towards
        consideringvoicing disagreements more openly from the rest of the board if we were tosee not only upward
        surprises in headline inflation in the coming months, butsome transmission from those surprises into core
        inflation, which has been on adownward trajectory for the past four months, and stood at 0.7% YoY in
        August.<br/><br/>
        Inflation surprises materialized in September for professional forecasters, butnot for the NBP.<br/><br/>
        The yearly growth rate of CPI inflation accelerated to 0.4% in September, from-0.1% in August, bringing the year
        on year average to 2.2% in September. Asdepicted in Figure 2, our forecasts had an uncertainty rage similar to
        that ofthe survey of professional forecasters in Bloomberg (+1.7% to +2.1%, from 26economists). As we had hinted
        in our weekly publication, our median projectionhad upside risks that materialized because of the influence of
        exogenous factorsin the last two weeks of the month, in our view.</p>
