    <p> Softness in stock in the next two months could be a buying opportunity.<br/><br/>
        We still see a mix of investors cautious and optimistic about NetEase's outlook.<br/><br/>
        Thus, we think a potential 3Q17 earnings miss could prompt another shake outin the stock and help reset
        expectations. That said, we may be nearing the endof bearish sentiment beyond 3Q17 earnings, especially if
        NetEase's new gamepipeline unveiling in December is promising. We make earnings adjustments thatlower our target
        price to US$325 from US$348 but with 20% implied upside, wemaintain our Buy rating.<br/><br/>
        Softness in mobile game driving potential 3Q17 earnings miss.<br/><br/>
        We end the September quarter with our mobile game tracker indicating -20%QoQ (+46% YoY) versus our previous
        expectation of -12% QoQ, largely as Onmyojicontinued to fade and some softness in other key mobile titles. The
        cut to revenuecascades down to lower earnings where we revise down our 3Q17 FDEPADS toUS$3.0 from US$3.4 and a
        further 2017/2018 EPS cut of 4%/7% respectively. Thesoftness in mobile gaming trends is broadly known by the
        market, based on ourongoing discussion with investors. That said, we bore witness to a sharp stockcorrection
        after a similar trackable earnings miss in 2Q17 and we are concernedit could happen again during 3Q17
        earnings.<br/><br/>
        Strong e-commerce performance offers some buffer to valuation and stock.<br/><br/>
        Management's tone remains strong for e-commerce and we see possibility thatStreet explicitly or implicitly start
        to give the stock value for it, especially ifreporting transparency improves. For now, our back of the envelope
        calculationis that the business could be worth US$3bn, or ~9% of current market cap,and provide some modest
        support to overall valuations. For example, our bearcase scenario analysis involves NetEase weakening to US$216,
        but with somebuffer from e-commerce, we may see downside support around US$235~US$240. For the time being, the
        key driver of stock fluctuations resides with thegame business, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and key risk.<br/><br/>
        We value NetEase on a probability-weighted earnings taking into considerationthe bull, base, and bear case
        scenario for 2018. Key downside risk is significantdeterioration of key existing PC and mobile games and/or
        accelerated decline ingross margins.</p>
