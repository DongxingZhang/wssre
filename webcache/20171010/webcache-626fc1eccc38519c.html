    <p> The current account deficit ratio widened to -2.4% in Q2from a revised -2%(was -2.1%)<br/><br/>
        This was worse than our expectations, but still remains well below trend. Themiss came predominantly from larger
        net transfers to trade partners from theSouthern African Customs Union (SACU), which rose to -1% of GDP (from
        -0.6%in Q1), the largest in three years. Though Treasury revised the preliminary SACUpayments to R56bn (from
        39bn) in the new fiscal year starting April, we mistakenlybelieved the number would be lower due to lower
        imports, a stronger randexchange rate and arguably weaker growth in the region. In turn, the trade
        surpluswidened to 1.4% of GDP (from 1.3% in Q1) thanks to improved exports (valuesand volumes), despite higher
        imports and a deterioration in terms of trade. Netincome and services deficits widened to -2.9% of GDP (from
        -2.7%) on account ofa sharp decline in net dividend receipts and an increase in payments for technicalservices.
