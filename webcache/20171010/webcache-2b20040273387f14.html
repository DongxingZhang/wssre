    <p> Tepid ICE sales growth in Jan-Aug indicated a moderate peak-season recovery.Althoughthe general inventory levels
        have been effectively reduced during 2Q17, which will spurOEMs¡¯ wholesales growth in the coming peak season, the
        tepid shipmentgrowth in Jan-Augperiodthat suggestsa moderate recovery ahead may driveup the inventory levels
        again, particularlyfor those OEMs with a weak product cycle and require rather significant
        promotionalactivitiesin securing their market share. As such, we have retained our estimate of a mid-to-low
        single-digit ICE shipmentgrowth rate for FY17E.<br/><br/>
        Strong NEV sales rebound in Jul-Aug signaled stronger growth in 2H17 and 1H18. July and August saw a dramatic
        rebound in NEV shipment growth of 55% and 76% respectively,ending six consecutive months of weak growth (below
        36%), which in our view was primarily due to the fadingimpacts of the subsidy policylaunched in FY17E.We
        believeNEV shipmentswill resume growth in 2H17 andreach 700k units for the full year of FY17Eas per our prior
        estimate.On the other hand, giventhat majority of the NEV parts suppliers have been severely affected by the
        reduced orders and extended payment period of the OEMsduring 1H17, we expectthe strong NEV shipments to lead to
        a solid sales volume recovery for upstream NEV parts suppliers, albeit their GPM will continue to come under
        pressure due to lower ASP and higher costs.<br/><br/>
        New subsidy policy exertedrelatively lessinfluenceon motive lead battery suppliers. Since motive lead acid
        batteriesare primarily used in low-speed vehicles rather NEVs, lead acid battery manufacturers were less
        impacted by the NEV subsidy policy implementation in 1H17,delivering solid sales growth, whilst theirslightly
        lower GPM in the interimwas mainly attributabletothe upsurge in lead priceswhich we foresee will likely remain
        at the current high level in the coming monthsgiventighteningenvironmental protectionrequirementsin winterseason
        ofChina,though at the same time we believe theirGPM will see a mild recovery on the back of increasing shipments
        and stable production costs, in our view.</p>
