    <p> National cement price continued to rise. The average cement price (nationwide)increased 1.3% week on week to
        RMB336.89/tonne last week. Cement prices in partsof Tangshan, Nanjing, Fuzhou and Chongqing were up
        RMB30-60/tonne. Cementprices were supported by the recovery in downstream demand in mid-September. Dailyshipment
        volume of cement companies went back to 80-100% of the normal level inmost areas. The average inventory level
        (nationwide) decreased to 62.25%.<br/><br/>
        Coal prices increased slightly. The comprehensive average price index for Bohai-Rim Steam Coal (Q5500K) was up
        RMB3/tonne to RMB586/tonne last week. Theindex was up 5.8% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.<br/><br/>
        Potential production suspension in Anhui remains to be seen. To control airpollution during the winter season,
        especially the level of PM2.5, construction materialsfactories may need to suspend ~30% of their production
        capacity to meet the stricterenvironmental requirements in Tongling, Anhui, based on the request of
        localauthorities. According to the latest document released by the local government, if theair quality in Q3
        does not meet certain targets, companies such as Conch Cement[0914.HK; HOLD] may need to partially suspend
        production in the area from October.<br/><br/>
        It remains to be seen whether it will be a positive or negative for Conch Cement,depending on whether the
        potential cement price hike caused by the productionsuspension is enough to offset the impact of lower
        production volume. Currently,Conch Cement has about 13m tonnes of clinker capacity in Tongling. If we
        assumeabout 30% of the capacity in Tongling will be suspended, we estimate a cement pricehike of about
        RMB30/tonne in the area would be enough to offset the reduction inproduction volume.<br/><br/>
