    <p> This week Republican leaders rolled out an outline of their muchanticipated tax plan. Although the plan was
        broadly as anticipated andlacked key details, it was met with enthusiasm by markets that startedto price
        non-zero odds that a meaningful tax package could pass. Weprovide an early analysis of the proposal.<br/><br/>
        Estimates of the budget impact of the plan at this stage are highlyuncertain. Nonetheless, we estimate that the
        tax plan as presented wouldlikely add $2-2.5tn to the budget deficit over the next decade.<br/><br/>
        Passage of this package, even a slimmed down version, is going to bepolitically difficult. However, we continue
        to see scope for a modesttax cut to be passed, focused primarily on the corporate side, thatis significantly
        less detrimental to the budget outlook than the planpresented this week. In our view, a more reasonable baseline
        for thebudget impact is a $1.2-1.7tn increase in the deficit in the next 10 years.<br/><br/>
        IRS data highlight the potential for resistance towards the removalof household itemized deductions. With larger
        blocs of RepublicanRepresentatives in states that are more negatively affected by the taxincreases in the bill,
        Republican Representatives are more likely to beunder pressure to defect from their party line. Indeed,
        California and NewYork, two of the states that will be most negatively impacted by theremoval of itemized
        deductions, have enough Republican Representativesjust between themselves to kill a bill if Democrats all vote
        against the planand these Republicans break with their party.<br/><br/>
        We then use the Fed¡¯s model of the US economy to assess themacroeconomic implications of the Republican tax
        plan. Assuming taxcuts are enacted in Q1 2018, the full tax plan would lift growth byabout 0.4pp by end-2018 and
        cause the Fed to undertake nearly twoadditional rate hikes by end-2019. A more modest tax plan in line withour
        expectations would lift 2018 growth by 0.2pp and cause the Fed toundertake almost one additional rate hike by
        end-2019.<br/><br/>
        The Fed's response is critical to these results. If instead we constrain theFed to not react to the tax cuts, we
        find that growth is meaningfully higher,the unemployment rate is much lower, and core inflation would
        overshootthe Fed¡¯s target, potentially by a large amount. These results depict veryclearly why we should expect
        the Fed to tighten monetary policy at leastmodestly faster than they currently anticipate if tax cuts are
        passed.</p>
