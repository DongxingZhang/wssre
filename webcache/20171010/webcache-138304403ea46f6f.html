    <p> In the recent weeks, the press (e.g. Bloomberg, China Securities Journal etc) has beenincreasingly talking about
        an impending boom in hybrid capital issuance by Chinesebanks. We decided to take a closer look at the drivers
        behind it.<br/><br/>
        We believe Powerlong¡¯s growing recurrent income provides a potential buffer against apossible slow-down in
        commercial property sales.. Compared to TPHL 6.25% 2020C19s,Powerlong¡¯s bond provides a Z-spread pick up of
        almost 100bp We upgrade PowerlongUSD300mn 2020s from Hold to Buy.<br/><br/>
        We have had a neutral view on Asia credit since our 2H Outlook on June 1, arguing thatit will largely be a carry
        play. This has more or less played out with the overall spreadsalmost unchanged. If our base case of no negative
        surprise plays out, we would not besurprised to see spreads resume their tightening bias sometime in October.
        Withfundamentals supportive and technicals strong, tight valuations are perhaps justified.</p>
