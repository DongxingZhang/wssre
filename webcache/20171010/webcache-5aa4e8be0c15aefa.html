    <p> Moody¡¯s downgrade also reiterates our view on BoCom FL<br/><br/>
        Moody¡¯s has recently finished its rating review on BoCom Financial Leasing(BoComFL) and downgraded its issuer
        &amp; bond ratings to A3/Stable (from A2).This largely reflects the rating action for its parent company ¨C Bank
        ofCommunications - where Moody¡¯s noted deterioration in its funding profile andprofitability. The downgrade also
        re-affirms our view that within the universe ofleasing companies under coverage, BoComFL remains our least
        preferredlessor as<br/><br/>
        (1) its bonds¡¯ RV proposition still looks unattractive vis-¨¤-vis<br/><br/>
        (2)weaker operating fundamentals. Within BoCoMFL¡¯s bonds, we maintain ourCreditSell calls on BCOMFL 2.625% ¡¯21s
        and 3.5% ¡¯22s (at current 98.4/140.7and 101.6/144.4bid-price/G-spread respectively).<br/><br/>
        RV comparison: Underperformed, but still not attractive enough<br/><br/>
        As compared to late May (when Moody¡¯s initiated the review of a downgrade),though BoComFL bonds¡¯ G-spread has
        underperformed its peers by ~4bpacross all durations but its bonds still have tightened by ~18bps in
        mid-Gspreadduring this period (Figure 2), which we believe is unjustified.</p>
