    <p> The past two weeks saw net Southbound buying after a marked slowdown in inflows in August.<br/><br/>
        We previously argued that last month¡¯s slowdown was a temporary phenomenon, as H-sharescontinued to trade at 30%
        discount to A-shares. The net buying was mainly in large banks andsmaller insurance firms. We saw profit taking
        in commodity plays and China property stocks. Thenew favourites of Stock Connect investors include Health &amp;
        Happiness Inc, Digital China, and theIPPs. The top reductions include IGG, and the steel and metal
        companies.<br/><br/>
        1) Top Stock Connect Net Buying Still Skewed towards Large Caps.<br/><br/>
        As Figure 1 shows, the weighting of the Stock Connect positions is still heavily skewed towards HSBC,CCB,
        Tencent and ICBC, with the position in these four stocks amounting to over HK$225bn, almost 30%of the aggregate
        value of the entire Stock Connect Program.<br/><br/>
        We find that Stock Connect investors slightly increased their exposure in large China banks and smallerinsurance
        firms in the past two weeks. There was also some switching in the auto companies and profittaking in commodity
        stocks. Notably, China property stocks saw profit taking by Stock Connect investors.</p>
