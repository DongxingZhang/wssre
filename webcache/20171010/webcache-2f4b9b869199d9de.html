    <p> The Central Bank of Republic of Turkey kept its one week repo (8%), overnightdeposit (7.25%) and lending (9.25%)
        rate, and second upper bound (lateliquidity window, 12.25%) all unchanged on Thursday, all in line withunanimous
        market positioning.<br/><br/>
        The short statement was slightly amended to take the latest macro outturninto consideration. On the growth
        front, following a resilient Q2GDP print anda very strong July industrial production print, the Bank now says
        '...recoveryin economic activity has gained strength' versus '...expected to maintain itsstrength' mentioned in
        July. After having probably observed the recent peakin their impact, the Committee this time dropped their
        reference to '(public)measures and incentives (supportive of growth)', which primarily includes theCredit
        Guarantee Fund among others. On inflation, next to the elevated levels seenin headline CPI, the Bank this time
        also highlights the recent rise in core inflationand its ensuing impact on pricing behaviour, hence maintenance
        of a tight policystance for now, in a la Turca terms.<br/><br/>
        Forward-looking bits of the statement are kept unchanged. The Bank still commitsto maintaining a tight policy
        stance until the inflation outlook displays significantimprovement. Like in July, the MPC keeps the door open
        for further tightening, ifneed be. The next rate decision will be on October 26th.</p>
