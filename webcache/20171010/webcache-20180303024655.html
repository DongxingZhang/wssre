    <p> Egyptian inflation remained elevated in August, but showed signs of abatement<br/><br/>
        We expect the MPC to take a conservative approach, keeping interest ratesunchanged in its next meeting on
        September 28. While the probability of a cutin interest rates at the November CBE meeting has risen, our base
        case as of yetis that the CBE will remain on hold.<br/><br/>
        The latest CPI inflation print released on Sunday 10th of September showed themonthly inflation rate fell in
        August to 1.2% compared to the month of July.Accordingly, the annual inflation rate dropped to 33.2% YoY, from
        34.3% YoY inJuly. The overall urban CPI index decreased from 33.0% YoY in Jul, to 31.9% YoYin Aug. The main
        contributors to the monthly change in urban prices came fromthe rise in prices of means of transport,
        electricity and food.<br/><br/>
        The inflation slowdown follows after the new round of lifting subsidies onpetroleum products, increasing
        electricity prices and the introduction of valueadded tax. The government¡¯s decision in compliance with demands
        by the IMF toraise electricity prices by 42% and gasoline prices by 55% in early July has likelyhad a major
        impact on firm¡¯s input costs.<br/><br/>
        Yet, the August inflation print suggests that firms have not completely passed therise in input costs to
        consumers. Despite of increasing inflationary expectations,partly due to the government¡¯s commitment to fully
        lift subsidies by the endof 2021, we believe businesses' consideration to strive in domestic marketcompetition
        is one reason why they have decided to absorb costs and not passthe rise in input costs to consumers.<br/><br/>
        Recent PMI data showed a boost in sentiment for better economic conditions,with the level of confidence being
        the strongest observed in six months.Furthermore, the same data shows a fall in composite input price index for
        themonth of August after a rising trend since May.<br/><br/>
        We are optimistic about a fall in inflation rates in the next few months. In ourview, the tight stance of CBE
        remains consistent with reaching the upper bandof the inflation target centered at 13% by 2018Q4and single
        digits thereafter. Inits meeting last August, the Egypt¡¯s monetary policy committee decided to keepinterest
        rates unchanged at 18.75% for deposits and 19.75% for overnight lendingafter it raised interested rates by
        200basis points in July.</p>
