    <p> We reiterate our view of the home appliance industry¡¯s defensive naturebased on: (1) slowing growth in the air
        conditioner segment anticipated in 2H17; a duopoly of Haier and Little Swan taking shape in the washing machine
        market; and lackluster refrigerator shipments; and (2)segment leaders like Gree, Midea and Robam with
        increasingly attractive valuations winning the favor of mutual fund investors and qualified foreign
        institutional investors(QFIIs).<br/><br/>
        Key home appliance industry developments in 1H17. (1) In the mature home appliance industry, regular
        shareholding changes reflectingrational judgments on industry fundamentals should not be overinterpreted. Having
        said that, we should still keep an eye on some substantial buys andsells that have recently happened in
        thisindustry.(2) Copper, aluminum, steel and plastic constitute more than half of white goods costs, with hot
        rolled sheets, copper and aluminum prices all remaining at high levels since 2H16. Given their predominant
        market shares and product positioning, industry leaders are in a better position to weather rawmaterial cost
        headwinds with pricing leverage, in our view.<br/><br/>
        2H17 forecast: (1) we are cautious on the home appliance industry in terms of absolute return but expect it to
        generate competitive relative return in the context of a weak market; (2) with their cost, branding and channel
        advantages, industry leaders are better placed to buttress growth even in times of market turmoil; (3) the home
        appliance industry is a sought-after target of northbound capital, which has seemingly been buoyed by the recent
        inclusion of A shares in the MSCI emerging markets index; and(4) valuation changes from 2017 to 2018 may not be
        as dramatic as that from 2016 to 2017.</p>
