    <p> Growth rate held up in Aug 2017. In general, we saw divergence in the share price performance of the HK-listed
        technology hardware names afterthe release of the 1H 2017 results. Those with exposure to high-growth areas,
        such as optical components, optical communications and AI, outperformedthe sector and the HSI and MSCI on a
        one-month basis. Sentiment on certain hardware names was also hit by major earnings misses andcuts in guidance,
        but we think they are more company-specific and unlikely to hit overall sentiment on the sector. Recent data
        points may suggest thatgrowth in the sector held up in Aug 2017 vs. Jul 2017, which may support the share price
        performance of the technology hardware sector as a whole.<br/><br/>
        Most of the Taiwan-listed technology names (materials &amp; equipment, wafers, semiconductors, IC design, LEDs,
        TFT-LCDs, packaging &amp; testing,lenses, DRAMs, ODMs, optical components &amp; casings, networking, PCBs, auto
        electronics, other terminals and distribution) have reported their Aug2017 turnover, and we note that some
        sectors reported a pick-up in top-line growth in Aug 2017 vs. Jul 2017. Sector wide, materials &amp;
        equipment,wafer manufacturing, foundries, LED, PCBs, packaging &amp; testing, casings and distribution saw
        higher top-line MoM growth in Aug 2017. Even thoughwe didn¡¯t see a pick-up in the growth rate of other sectors,
        like IC design, lenses, components, optical communications and ODMs, in Aug 2017 vs. Jul2017, it didn¡¯t
        decelerated further. The Aug 2017 data may suggest that investor concerns about a slowdown in growth should have
        eased somewhat.<br/><br/>
        Apple-related suppliers still lead and remain the market focus. As in Jul 2017, Apple-related companies, like
        Flexium, Zhen Ding, Catcher, Merry,TSMC, Largan and Genius, reported faster turnover growth in Aug 2017 vs. Jul
        2017, which the market treated as positive signal for the Apple[AAPL.US] supply chain. GIS also reported
        respectable top-line growth in Aug 2017 (though it slowed down a bit MoM) which also showed the impactof Apple¡¯s
        ramp-up of production of new iPhones. Regarding brand names, the market remains focused on news flow on the
        Apple supply chain, asApple will hold the launch of its new iPhone, which the market will treat as a catalyst
        for the whole sector. We believe investors may be concernedabout selling pressure on Apple-related names after
        the launch. But we still suggest investors hold a medium to long-term view on Apple¡¯s supplychain.<br/><br/>
        As we noted in our previous analysis on what would happen after the iPhone launch event, we have watched the
        share price performance of Appleand nine major iPhone component suppliers, AAC, Catcher, Flexium, Hon Hai,
        Largan, Pegatron, TPK, TSMC and Zhen Ding, since 2011. On average,Apple¡¯s shares were up 0.1% the day after the
        launches, and AAC was the outperformer, on average, reporting 0.5% share price appreciationafter the launch
        events. On average, shares of the nine component suppliers fell 0.4%-3.5% the day after Apple¡¯s launch events in
        2011-2016. Theworst-performing year was 2013, when the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S product cycles didn¡¯t offer
        special features, and shares of Apple and its supplierswere under pressure the day after the launch. 2015 was
        another difficult year for component suppliers, as the iPhone 6S didn¡¯t offer too many positivesurprises after
        the iPhone 6 had reported a 36% increase in shipments. Apple and most of the suppliers mentioned above (except
        TPK) offered goodreturns by holding their share values for a long period. Missing short-term profit-taking
        didn¡¯t really affect the long-term return. ODMs also reportedsolid MoM turnover growth in Aug 2017, which we
        believe was partly due to stronger notebook &amp; PC shipments and increasing sal es of cloud-basedservers.
        Regarding the PC side, Acer¡¯s steady MoM turnover figures in Aug 2017 confirm that the PC industry continues to
        perform well despite concernsabout the growth outlook. In the Hong Kong market, the messages from both Sunny
        Optical [2382.HK] and Q-Tech [1478.HK] indicate that thegrowth outlook can vary for different players in the
        same industry. Sunny Optical released its Aug 2017 shipment figures, which showed a 40% MoMincrease in shipments
        of camera modules (despite delayed invoice billings for Jul shipments) and a 19% MoM increase in shipments of
        lenses (newproduct launch by Samsung). Sunny also started shipments of hybrid lenses (glass &amp; plastic).
        Sunny¡¯s shipments of vehicle lens sets also reportedgood MoM growth, up 12.9%. QTech, however, updated its
        guidance on its shipment targets for camera modules in 2017, lowering the projectedgrowth rate from 25% to at
        least 10%. The Company highlighted that capacity constraints were the reason for the reduced shipment target.
        NewMax¡¯sweak shipment figures in Aug 2017 remain a concern for us. To a certain extent, we maintain our cautious
        view on QTech.<br/><br/>
        Handsets. We saw divergence in the share price performance of HK-listed hardware names, given mixed industry
        news flow and increasing attentionto certain sub-segments, such as OLED displays and optics. The optical
        component-related names, such as AAC [2018.HK], Cowell and Sunny Optical,outperformed. The Aug 2017 turnover
        figures of Apple suppliers (Catcher, GIS, Flexium, TSMC, Castek, Merry, Largan and Genius) remain on thepositive
        side, which boosted sentiment on Apple-related names. As previously discussed, Apple¡¯s product launch on 12 Sept
        (tonight HK time) remainsa key event, which will drive sentiment on its suppliers. But we still suggest
        investors take a long-term view. We share the view that profit takingon HK-listed iPhone suppliers is expected,
        given their recent share price outperformance. But we would like to highlight that Apple had a major
        productupgrade in 2017, and even if shipment volume is flat (which we don¡¯t think will happen, as iPhone¡¯s huge
        installed base should support volumegrowth), the component suppliers will benefit from an ASP increase. Apple is
        likely to have an advantage in key component supply, such as OLEDdisplays and 3D sensing modules, and the
        Chinese brands are unlikely to catch up in the near term. However, recent data points released by Truly[0732.HK]
        and Q-Tech may cap their share price performance, as they are underperforming their peers. Cowell e Holdings¡¯
        [1415.HK] (Cowell) is anoutperformer among of its peers, as it will be a major beneficiary of Apple¡¯s
        new-product launch. Although we saw a Cowell share price correction fromits recent peak, the Company remains on
        track to deliver a major recovery in operating performance in 2H 2017. Hon Hai¡¯s Aug 2017 turnover figures,in
        our view, were a downside surprise for the market, as it was expecting Hon Hai to benefit from Apple¡¯s new
        product launch. However, FIT HonTeng¡¯s [6088.HK] growth will be supported by shipments of new handset
        components, further penetration into the auto electronics segment and marketshare gains in the optical
        communications segment. We think the share price movement of the leading technology hardware names,
        includingSunny Optical, FIT Hon Teng and AAC Cowell, may be volatile, given potential profit-taking after their
        share price rally. We believe that investors aresticking with leading high-end component manufacturers due to a)
        their more stable performance, b) smartphone specification upgrades, and c) strongR&amp;D; capability. As for
        the leading technology hardware names, any potential share price weakness after Apple¡¯s launch event may provide
        a good reentryopportunity. For companies which have disappointed the market, such as Tongda [0698.HK], QTech and
        Truly [0732.HK], we don¡¯t see anynear-term catalysts to justify a re-rating.</p>
