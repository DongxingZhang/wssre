    <p> Last Friday the HKSFC released the aggregate short positions data for September 15. Weanalysed which companies
        may be vulnerable to short-selling activity, based on the followingthree criteria: (i) the net change in short
        positions between September 8 and September15; (ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the
        absolute amount of shortpositions. We must emphasize this is only an objective quantitative analysis based
        onofficial data; the analysis does NOT imply that we feel uncomfortable with the corporategovernance or
        fundamentals of some companies. Based on the results of our analysis,we believe COSCO Shipping (1919.HK), IGG
        (0799.HK) and SmarTone (0315.HK)require close monitoring, based on their latest short positions outstanding. We
        also see accumulatingshort positions in Cheming Paper (1812.HK) and YOFC (6869.HK), probablybecause of their
        impressive share price performance YTD. On the other hand, we note thatshort positions in China Harmony
        (3836.HK) and Maple Leaf (1317.HK) have dropped significantly.<br/><br/>
        Short positions in COSCO Shipping, IGG and SmarTone increased significantly. AsFigure 1 shows, the short
        positions in COSCO Shipping, IGG and SmarTone rose 38.5%,26.8% and 20.9%, respectively, during the week ended
        September 15. The outstandingshort positions were equivalent to 3.7%, 10% and 11.2% of their free float. We
        believe theincrease in short positions in COSCO Shipping is largely because of the rally YTD, with again of 66%.
        For SmarTone, the increase in short positions is likely related to the de-ratingprocess in the past few weeks
        after the release of disappointing FY17 results. Meanwhile,we have already highlighted the rising short
        positions in IGG in the past few weeks. We alsonote a rise in short positions in other well-performing stocks
        YTD, such as Chenming Paperand YOFC, which rose 51.1% and 45.3%, respectively, during the week ended
        September15. The outstanding short positions were equivalent to 2.9% and 2.7% of their free float.<br/><br/>
        Significant decline in the short positions in China Harmony and Maple Leaf. Short positionsin China Harmony and
        Maple Leaf dropped 30.4% and 24.4%, respectively, duringthe week ended September 15 (Figure 2). In China
        Harmony¡¯s case, we highlighted the decreasein short positions earlier. The sharp reduction in short positions in
        Maple Leaf waslikely driven by a share price rebound of 27% in the past few weeks. We have seen moresouthbound
        inflow to this stock; and holdings by southbound investors increased from5.97% of issued shares in early August
        to 6.97% last Friday.<br/><br/>
        Review of ideas last week. We highlighted the surge in short positions in Life Tech(1302.HK) last week, and its
        share price dropped 8.4%. We also mentioned the decline inshort positions of Dali Foods (3799.HK) and China
        Travel (0308.HK) last week, and theirshare prices rose 6.3% and 5.1%.<br/><br/>
        Recap: Source of data. The HKSFC releases the aggregate short positions in all eligiblestocks every Friday with
        a delay of one week. The HKEx releases the data on short-sellingactivity on a daily basis (without a one-week
        delay), but investors do not know whether theshort positions are covered or not later. Therefore, the usefulness
        of the HKSFC data is thatit provides the outstanding short positions in each stock, and investors can trace the
        netchange on a weekly basis. However, there are still some limitations, as this data set cannotcover
        short-selling activity using OTC derivative products.</p>
