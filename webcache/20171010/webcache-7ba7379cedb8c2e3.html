    <p> Strong output in August, full-year growth on track.In August, LYP generated 3,346GWh of poweroutput (up 12.9%
        YoY), driven by a 23.2% growth in wind power generation (accounting for 68.5% of total output) which was partly
        offset by a 4.8% decrease in coal power generation (29.9% of total output), whereas the output of other
        renewables remained relatively stable,gaining 1.3% YoY and accounted for merely 1.6% of total output. Meanwhile,
        HNR reported total power generation of 1,211GWh (up 14.0% YoY), on the back of a 15.0% YoY growth in wind power
        output (91.6% of total output) and 4.3% YoY growth in solar power output (8.4% of total output).Regarding YTD
        performance, LYP and HNR achieved 8M17wind power output growth of 12.8% and 13.0% YoY, and total output growth
        of 12.0% and 13.5% YoY respectively,which are generally in-line with our full-year estimates.<br/><br/>
        LYP registered major growth in Northwest and Eastern China, which accounted for 33% and 24% of its
        year-over-year incremental power output, while the other four regions also maintained steady growth(6-14%
        increments). Provincial wise, the main growth drivers were Gansu, Fujian, Xinjiang and Heilongjiang, accounting
        for 19%/15%/14%/12% of the incrementsrespectively, whereas Liaoning, Ningxia and Shandong were the main drags.
        According to the management,the overall curtailment rate has dropped by 5.3ppt YoY to 7.7% (vs. 13.0% in
        Aug-16).<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, HNR saw major growth in Southern China, which contributed 74% of the increment in its power
        output.Northern China experienced the only output decline, while the other four regions contributed 6-10% of the
        increment. Yunnan and Guizhou were the main provincial growth drivers, accounting for 46% and 18% of the
        increments; their utilization increased by 102% and 45% YoY respectively which we think was due to the low-base
        in Aug-16.On the contrary, the main drag was in Inner Mongolia where it had undergonemaintenance works on the
        local power infrastructure. Meanwhile, the overall curtailment ratehasdropped 3.0ppt YoY to 5.6% (vs. 8.6% in
        Aug-16). Reiterate BUY on LYPand HNR.LYP is currently trading at FY17E/FY18E PERof 11.0x/9.8x, versus 7.6x/6.8x
        for HNRrespectively. Both are trading at over 1SD below theirhistoricalaverage.</p>
