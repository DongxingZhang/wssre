    <p> China: Our 2017 GDP growth forecast is 0.1ppts higher now at 6.8%. President Xi¡¯s long-term view on China
        focuses more on the quality of growth rather than the speed, which we think is appropriate. We expect the
        leaders set the growth target for 2018 more flexibly, and growth will slow to 6.3%.</p>
