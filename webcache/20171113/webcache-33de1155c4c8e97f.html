    <p> Less oil, more tourists: For the Vietnamese government, oil is old and tourism istrending. The government aims
        to incentivize more visitors to the country amidstfalling oil production. We believe this to be a more
        sustainable policy, given thecountry's dwindling oil production and its growing services sector. It should
        alsoprovide support for the current account, partly offsetting the decline in oil exports andVietnam's
        import-intensive electronics production. Moreover, we are optimistic onVietnam's tourism sector in light of
        recent reforms. We expect visitor numbers toexceed 10m annually in the foreseeable future, provided continued
        liberalization anda benign external environment.<br/><br/>
        The end of an era: Vietnam's oil production peaked in 2000but remained a bedrockfor growth from 2000-2010(in
        addition to production of textiles, footwear, andagriculture). However, production of fossil fuels has fallen in
        recent years, andgovernment officials have signalled that this could be the new norm. Fortunately, withthe end
        of an era comes a new one: Vietnam has comfortably shifted to electronics,which has been a reliable source for
        growth over the past several years (Chart 1).Tourism has also provided a boon to the services sector, which with
        continueddevelopment could provide Vietnam with more diversified sources of growth.<br/><br/>
        Exports up, PMI down: Meanwhile, exports remain on sunny grounds, at least fornow. October marked the third
        consecutive month of above-20% export growth, drivenby a 76.4% y-o-y rise in phone exports. However, the PMI
        dipped as respondentspointed to signs of softer demand. This affirms our view of still-high but slower growthin
        4Q, despite perhaps a marginal slowdown in exports and manufacturing.</p>
