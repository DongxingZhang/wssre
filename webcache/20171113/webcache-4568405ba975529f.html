    <p> In this report, we highlight a list of stocks that could beconsidered for inclusion and exclusion in the
        upcoming review.<br/><br/>
        MSCI is due to announce the results of its semi-annual index review on themorning of November 14, including a
        list of stock additions and removals alongwith changes in weightings. The changes will be effective December
        1.<br/><br/>
        Exhibit 1 highlights the stocks that could potentially be added or removed, basedon the latest available market
        and shareholding data. In the forthcoming review,we see a high likelihood of Britannia, Federal Bank (the
        largest stock in the MSCIIndia small cap index), and Petronet LNG being added to the index. ContainerCorp and
        Tata Motors DVR are the stocks with the smallest-free floatcapitalization and full market capitalization in the
        index and thus could becandidates for removal.<br/><br/>
        PSU Banks ¨C potential MSCI Inclusion? Currently, SBI is the only PSU (publicsector) bank that is part of the
        MSCI India index. BoB and PNB are the other twolarge PSU banks. Their current free float market cap is below the
        thresholdmarket cap required for inclusion. At the end of Sep-17, foreign portfolioinvestors (FPI) were
        underweight SBI, while domestic mutual funds (DMF) wereoverweight the stock. SBI is the fifth-largest holding
        for DMFs, while it is the20th-largest holding for FPIs. For more on ownership trends, see our reporttitled India
