    <p> Luck and momentum are both in favour: Macau¡¯s gross gaming revenue (GGR)disappointed post the Golden Week
        holiday as investors were hopeful to see upbeatfigures in light of strong advanced hotel booking data. Entering
        into 2H of October,the weekly data suggested that the VIPs did not cancel their trip, they only chose tocome
        later given the timing of the 19th Party Congress. Post the big event in Beijing,we saw a noticeable pick up in
        VIP rolling volume growth. When coupled withfavourable luck, which we estimated to have come in at around 3.1%
        for the fullmonth, VIP revenue growth could be tracking ahead of 30%y-o-y. Premium masssegment may have
        benefited from the strong VIP growth but still tracks below 10%y-o-y in our view. By operators, Galaxy, Sands
        and MGM seemed to have gainedshare from SJM and MLCO, based on what we observe.<br/><br/>
        October tracks ~20% y-o-y: Factoring a strong last week, we now expect Octoberto finish between MOP26-26.5bn GGR
        (vs ~MOP25bn previously), translating into anaverage daily run rate (ADR) of MOP800-860m/day for the last 10days
        of the month.</p>
