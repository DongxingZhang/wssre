    <p> Commentary for Monday: The main focus of this week's data docket is theadvance Q3 real GDP release on Friday.
        Our latest bottom-up tally of Q3 inflationadjustedoutput points to less of a drag on the economy from
        hurricane-relateddisruptions than originally anticipated. As a result, we have revised up our Q3 realGDP growth
        forecast 70 basis points (bps) to 2.7% and lowered our currentquarterprojection 30 bps to 2.8%. At this point,
        we have not made any changesto our 2018 or 2019 growth estimates of 2.2% and 1.9% (Q4/Q4),
        respectively.<br/><br/>
        Previously, we had expected substantial declines in chemicals and energy exportsdue to the shuttering of
        activity in the Gulf of Mexico region. However, theAugust trade data showed meaningful revisions to net exports
        whereby even ifwe assume some weakness in September, we are still likely to see a positiveoverall contribution
        from the external sector. In our Q3 forecast, we projectexports growth of 2.3% (versus 1.9% in Q2) while imports
        are expected to rise alesser 1.0%. Thursday's advance goods trade balance ($64.0 billion forecast vs.<br/><br/>
        -$62.0 billion previously) for September is the last release that may sway analysts'expectations for the initial
        Q3 GDP print.<br/><br/>
        Regarding the other components of Q3 output, we expect real PCE growth of2.0% (versus 3.3% in Q2). Some of this
        downshift reflects expected weaknessin services spending, in particular electric utilities. Recall that in Q2,
        electricityexpenditures surged 24% annualized, the third largest gain in the postrecessionperiod. Hence, we
        should see some payback from this category,which may be exacerbated by the wide-spread outages in the wake of
        thehurricanes. In addition, retail control, which is an excellent proxy for goodsspending in the GDP accounts,
        points to a moderate deceleration in Q3 PCE goodsexpenditures following a relatively robust 5.4% gain in
        Q2.<br/><br/>
        The largest hurricane-related impact on GDP may come from structuresspending, which we estimate to have declined
        -5.0% in Q3 (versus a 7.0%gain in Q2). This is partly a function of storm-related disruptions to the
        energysector, which had been the sole driver of the nearly 11% annualized increase innonresidential structures
        spending in the first half of the year. Indeed, energyrelatedexpenditures accounted for over 10% of the gain in
        nonresidentialequipment spending (capex) in H1. However, given the still-sturdy momentumin core durable goods
        orders through the first two months of Q3 and continued strength in forward-looking factory-sector surveys, we
        continue to expect asolid 8% gain in capex spending in Q3. Note that Wednesday¡¯s durable goodsorders report for
        September should sharpen forecasters¡¯ estimates for equipmentspending ahead of Friday¡¯s GDP release. Headline
        durables (+1.0% vs. +2.0%) willbe boosted by aircraft orders, while ex transportation orders (+0.3% vs.
        +0.5%)may rise more modestly.<br/><br/>
        Residential investment may be less impacted by the storms as we anticipatea -3.0% decline due to the weakness in
        construction and existing home sales.<br/><br/>
        However, this comes on the back of an unusually large -7.3% decline in Q2. In fact,the Q2 decline in residential
        investment was the largest since Q3 2010 (-30.7%).<br/><br/>
        While we remain broadly positive on the outlook for housing, the recent trendshave been somewhat lackluster
        (weather aside). For example, housing starts andbuilding permits were up only 1.3% and 2.0% year-over-year,
        respectively, lastquarter. Moreover, existing home sales were up only 1.6%. That said, the lackof housing supply
        has been an ongoing issue. Hence, Thursday's pending homesales (+1.0% vs. -2.6%) release for September is of
        greater interest to us thanWednesday's new home sales (575k vs. 560k).<br/><br/>
        We expect inventory investment to add roughly 30 bps to Q3 output growth.<br/><br/>
        However, this is one of the most volatile components of GDP and the auto sectorcan at times have an outsized
        influence. Note that motor vehicle assemblies havedeclined for the last four consecutive quarters and were down
        -27% annualizedin Q3¡ªthe largest quarterly decline since the last recession. Given the modestrebound in unit
        motor vehicle sales in Q3, there may have been some furtherdestocking in the sector last quarter.<br/><br/>
        Lastly, we project overall government spending to rise 2.0% in Q3 followingtwo consecutive quarterly declines.
        This is mostly due to an anticipated 3.0%spike in federal government expenditures¡ªa function of disaster relief
        effortsin hurricane-impacted regions. State and local expenditures are expected toincrease a lesser 1.5%
        following a somewhat unusual -1.5% drop in Q2¡ªthe largest quarterly decline since Q4 2012 (-2.6%). In summary,
        next week'seconomic data should keep Fed policymakers on track to raise rates again inDecember.</p>
