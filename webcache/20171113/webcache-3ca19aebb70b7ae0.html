    <p> 3Q17EPS of RMB0.16<br/><br/>
        Dahua reported 3Q17EPS of RMB0.16, which was 12% below the DB forecastof RMB0.18on rising selling expenses and
        higher finance costs. We maintainour Buy rating and TP of CNY27.5.<br/><br/>
        Higher selling expense and non-op loss impact on 3Q17profit<br/><br/>
        Dahua¡¯s 3Q17revenue and gross profits were in line with the DB forecast, but3Q17operating profits were 9% below,
        at RMB359m, -49% QoQ/+72% YoY,mainly due to a higher selling expense ratio, at 15%. Moreover, the non-opprofits
        were below our forecast, as the recurring income from the VAT taxreturn was offset by a surge in finance expense
        from forex losses. While 3Q17pre-tax income was 24% below the DB forecast, on rising expenses and lowernon-op,
        Dahua incurred a tax credit of RMB28m, as with the RMB32m taxcredit in 3Q16. 3Q17net income was 12% below the DB
        forecast at CNY461m,-34% QoQ/+28% YoY, for EPS of CNY0.16. For 1-3Q17, net profit registeredCNY1.4bn, within
        management guidance of CNY1.3-1.5bn<br/><br/>
        2017full-year guidance on profit growth at 20-40%<br/><br/>
        Management gave 2017full-year guidance of annual profit to grow 20-40%YoY, with the range of net profit at
        CNY2.2bn-2.6bn. We note that the newguidance is lower than the raised 25-45% guidance for 1-3Q17profit
        growthgiven out in August 2017. The lower guidance could potentially be a reflectionof the lower non-op income.
        As we enter the peak season in 4Q17, we expectrevenue to grow 26% QoQ/59% YoY, while operating margin recovers
        fromscale. Our 2017full-year profit forecast of RMB2.5bn, for EPS of RMB0.87, isat the high-end of management¡¯s
        guidance.<br/><br/>
        Positive 2018outlook with accelerated profit growth<br/><br/>
        We expect the strong revenue growth momentum to sustain into 2018as thecompany continues to expand market share
        with rising total solution projects.In addition, the AI applications and future PPP projects are catalysts to
        driveDahua¡¯s growth outlook. In particular, Dahua has indicated participation inAlibaba¡¯s ¡°City Brain¡± project
        in providing infrastructures such as front-endsensors, back-end storage and access platforms. We expect OPM to
        sustain atthe 2017level of 12%, with a rising solution contribution and increasing scale.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        As the 3Q17miss was mainly due to the rising selling expense and lower nonopincome, we lower our 2017earnings by
        7% but leave our 2018forecastunchanged. We remain positive on Dahua and our TP is unchanged atCNY27.5, based on
        22x FY2018E PE, supported by accelerated profit growth of38%/43% in 2017/2018and ROE expansions. Risks: market
        share loss andweak orders from solution projects.</p>
