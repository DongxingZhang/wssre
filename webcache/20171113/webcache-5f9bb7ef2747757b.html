    <p> Gujarat elections more important from market¡¯s point of view: The rulingBJP government has been in power since
        1995 in Gujarat and is PM Modi¡¯shome state, implying there will be greater interest in the party¡¯s performancein
        the state elections.<br/><br/>
        Gujarat elections to probably see more commentary around GST /demonetization: Amongst the two states, Gujarat
        has a larger presence ofsmall-scale businesses / traders which anecdotally have been impactedadversely by both
        demonetization and implementation of GST, againincreasing the state election¡¯s importance.<br/><br/>
        Vote share trends appear favourable for the ruling party: BJP¡¯s voteshare in Gujarat has remained steady (having
        declined by only 1.5% since2002) and the strong performance in some of the key state / local levelelections post
        2014 general elections creates a favourable outlook for theruling party.<br/><br/>
        Recent opinion poll favours BJP: Indeed, the recently released opinion pollby India Today group indicates that
        BJP¡¯s vote share will likely remain steadyand the party is expected to win 110-125 seats (vs. 115 seats won in
        2012 outof total 182 seats). The poll also suggests that BJP will likely gain majority inHimachal Pradesh
        winning 43-47 seats (of a total 68 seats).<br/><br/>
        Strength of election victory will be assessed: Given Gujarat is a BJPstronghold, markets may look at the
        strength of the victory to gauge thepolitical mood in the country. In our view, the strength of the victory
        couldsway the narrative on GST and tilt of government policies.<br/><br/>
        Possibility of favourable state election outcome along with the megaPSU bank recap plan may further keep market
        sentiment supported: Thegovernment has delivered on a much-needed policy measure yesterday, byannouncing a
        US$32.5bn PSU bank recapitalisation plan ( India Strategy -Bank recap - A decisive move) , which is a positive
        measure for macrooutlook and will keep market sentiment supported. Indeed, a strongperformance in state
        elections will further keep the market sentimentsupported in run-up to the general elections in 2019.</p>
