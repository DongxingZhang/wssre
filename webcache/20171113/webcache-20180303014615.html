    <p> We hosted an Education Tour in Sichuan and Guangdong to do a channelcheck on private schools, ranging from
        kindergartens to universities (i.e.<br/><br/>
        Minsheng, Virscend, Maple Leaf, Wisdom and Bright Scholar), to meet withcompany management about their expansion
        strategies, and to discussregulatory impacts with industry experts. Overall, we see promising new
        studentenrolment in the new school year 每 15% YoY on average, and little concernfrom managements on the revision
        of private education promotion law.<br/><br/>
        Robust K-12 enrolment in 2017/18. Private schools achieved robustenrolment growth in the 2017/18 school year, as
        shown in Figure 1. Of theschools we visited, we estimate 1) Minsheng＊s enrolment to increase 12%YoY organically
        to over 36k. The consolidation of Anhui Wonder should addanother 11k students to Minsheng＊s network. 2) Virscend
        reported 12% YoYenrolment growth to 39k, largely in line with our forecast, and was drivenmainly by the opening
        of eight new schools. We expect Virscend to achievestronger student acquisition in 2018/19. 3) Maple Leaf＊s
        enrolment grewc26% YoY to 26k on the ramp-up of existing schools coupled with new schoolopenings. 4) Wisdom
        reported 30% YoY enrolment growth to 41k. Excludingthe newly acquired Jieyang School, organic growth came in at
        15% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Operators see great potential for tuition fee hikes. While the Amendment ofPrivate Education Promotion Law
        became effective on 1 September 2017, wesee limited near-term impact. Although uncertainty remains with no
        provincialguidelines published, we are optimistic on the revision as we believe privateschools complement the
        inadequate public education service that requiresmuch more government funding compared to private schools.
        Management andschool headmasters are also positive on the regulatory environment, andexpect substantial room for
        future tuition fee hikes 每 potentially doubling.<br/><br/>
        Expansion approaches differ amongst schools 每 pros and cons. Of thoseprivate schools, Virscend, Maple Leaf and
        Bright Scholar guide growth via aprimarily asset-light model; Wisdom, on the other hand, is determined to
        growunder an asset-heavy model and guides to add 1-2 schools each year; andYuhua plans to adopt both asset-light
        and asset-heavy models. While assetheavymodels assert greater autonomy, asset-light models enable fasternetwork
        expansion 每 for example, Virscend opened four new campuses in2017, and Maple Leaf entered four new cities in
        1H17.<br/><br/>
        University and high school have the highest entry barriers. We believehigher education, especially university
        and high school, are the most difficultto tap into and build up a brand. The university segment is regulated
        with strictland requirement of 500 mu, and no new licenses are being issued by thegovernment. For high schools,
        new entrants lack a track record of universityacceptance rate 每 one of the most important factors assessed by
        studentsand parents. We believe it is easier for a reputable high school to expand intomiddle &amp; primary
        school vs the other way around. Pecking order: highereducation &gt; high school &gt; middle &amp; primary school
        &gt; kindergarten.</p>
