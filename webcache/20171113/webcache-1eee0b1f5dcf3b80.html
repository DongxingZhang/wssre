    <p> More than a WPC (wireless power charging) play; more tricks up its sleeve<br/><br/>
        Sunway¡¯s quarterly results beat expectations again, driven by GPM expansion,market share gain and ASP increase.
        Until now, we were focused primarily oniPhone¡¯s WPC module as the key 2018growth drivers, but Sunway¡¯s
        guidancenow suggests a much greater range of new businesses will be important in thelonger term, including VCM
        supporting frame, Lightning connectors and MIMOantenna. This is a positive surprise and prompts significant
        forecast revisionsand a raised valuation. Sunway targets to grow its dollar content per iPhonefrom sub-USD3now
        to USD10+ by 2019; retaining Buy.<br/><br/>
        Strong 3Q17results ¨C record-high sales, GPM and EPS<br/><br/>
        Sunway reported 3Q17EPS of CNY0.32(+68% YoY; +57% QoQ) and operatingprofit of CNY392m (+103% YoY; +149% QoQ) on
        sales of CNY1.05bn (+43%YoY; +47% QoQ). Sales and EPS beat our estimate by 10%/28%, propelled byASP hike and GPM
        expansion (up 13ppt QoQ to 45.9%, vs. DBe of 35%). Thefirm attributes ASP hike to spec upgrade or design changes
        on new iPhone¡¯santenna/EMI shielding case and new Galaxy Note¡¯s WPC/NFC/MST module. Itattributes GPM strength to
        spec upgrades, product mix, production yield, andsome one-off items (molding/toolings and NRE, in our
        view).<br/><br/>
        Rosy 4Q17/2018outlook, driven by VCM frame, Lightning connector and WPC<br/><br/>
        Sunway is positive on both top-line and margin outlook. The companyhighlighted 45.9% GPM in 3Q17is not
        recurring, but it targets to achieve 35%-40% in coming quarters (vs. historical pattern of ~30%). Sunway expects
        4Q17sales to follow seasonal pattern (~20%-25% QoQ growth), and 2018sales totop CNY7bn (80%+ YoY growth), driven
        by new iPhone projects, and to alesser extent, rising WPC penetration on Android OEMs. Sunway expects togenerate
        CNY2.5bn-3.0bn incremental sales (vs. our earlier estimate ofCNY1.5bn) from iPhone in 2018, driven by:(1)
        winning 6VCM supportingframe projects (ASP of USD1.2) in 2018vs. only 2projects in 2017;(2)penetrating into
        Lightning connector as the third supplier (likely less than 15%order allocation);(3) penetrating into WPC module
        (ASP of USD3.0) for 2018new iPhone with a 50% order allocation); and(4) mild market share gain incurrent
        products (antenna and EMI shielding cases).<br/><br/>
        Valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        We raise 2017/18/19EPS forecasts by 12%/33%/53% (better GPM and multiplenew iPhone projects) and increase TP
        from RMB45to RMB60. Our new TP isstill based on 35x PER, or 0.8x PEG (in line with regional peers). Risks:
        orderallocation loss; spec upgrade slowdown; and iPhone weakness.</p>
