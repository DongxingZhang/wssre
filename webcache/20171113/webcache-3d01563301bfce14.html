    <p> 48% profit growth amid improvement in passenger yield.<br/><br/>
        Spring reported 3Q17 gross revenue growth of 28.9% YoY to RMB3.6bn on theback of 15.0% passenger traffic (RPK)
        YoY growth and passenger yield recovery,in our opinion. Meanwhile, operating expenses increased at a slower pace
        of27.0% YoY due mainly to an increase in capacity (ASK), higher fuel cost andtake-off/landing fees post CAAC
        price reform in April, according to the company.<br/><br/>
        Together with 1) 22bps drop in SG&amp;A; to revenue ratio; 2) flattish net finance costand 3) limited investment
        loss (3Q16: RMB23.2m investment loss), the airlinerecorded a 36.6% YoY increase in operating profit to
        RMB696.9m. Helped byRMB195.0m non-operating income (+22.6% YoY) mainly from local airports routesubsidies, the
        airline¡¯s 3Q17 net profit grew by 47.6% YoY to RMB633.9m. Ona 9M17 basis, Spring's unaudited reported net profit
        increased by 1.6% YoY toRMB1.2bn.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C yield recovery on track; maintain Buy.<br/><br/>
        As Spring¡¯s 9M17 profit accounted for 117% of our full-year earnings estimate and107% of consensus, we consider
        the results beat our expectation. Even though4Q is usually a slow season for Chinese airlines, we see upside
        risk to our fullyear forecast, due to a decent yield trend and recovery in the international loadfactor. In
        September, Spring recorded 10.3% YoY passenger traffic (RPK) growth,driven by 18.2% YoY growth in domestic
        passenger traffic but 3.0% YoY declinein international traffic. Passenger load factor improved 0.4ppt YoY to
        89.6% inSeptember with international load factor recording YoY improvement (+2.9ppt to85.2%) for the first time
        since February.<br/><br/>
        We maintain Buy as we expect the airline¡¯s yield to bottom in FY17 with the loadfactor staying at c.92%. Our TP
        is based on 3.5x average FY18E P/BV, c.30%below Spring¡¯s average P/BV of 5.0x since listing. We believe this is
        justifiedvs. sustainable ROE of about 15-16%. Key downside risks: excessive capacityaddition; competition from
        regional LCCs and Chinese airlines; and slower-thanexpecteddemand growth.</p>
