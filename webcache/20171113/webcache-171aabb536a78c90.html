    <p> Delaying their trips? The first 22days of October yielded MOP18.8bn in gross gamingrevenue (GGR). This implies
        an average daily run rate (ADR) of MOP714m/day for thepast week, compared with MOP757m/day the week immediately
        after Golden Week andMOP550m/day for the same period last year. Despite m-t-d win rate normalized to 3.2-3.3%
        last week vs 3.4-3.6% the week before, we observed that VIP (+25% y-o-y) growthstayed strong and continued to
        outpace mass (+5-6% y-o-y) growth. We could be seeingVIPs delaying their trips given the timing of the 19th
        People Congress in China. Byoperators, MGM and Galaxy seemed to have gained shares from Sands and SJM.<br/><br/>
        October to track +13% to +16% y-o-y: With only one more weekend to go, we maintainour full-month forecasts at
        MOP24.7-25.3bn, translating into an ADR of MOP660-720m/day for the rest of the month.</p>
