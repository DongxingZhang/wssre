    <p> With ~8Mt of capacity scheduled to come online in the next 6 months and givencapacity has normalised in North
        America post Hurricane Harvey, we see marginheadwinds for upstream chemicals (olefins) as P/E prices are
        underperforming oilprices. Downstream chemicals - PTA, ABS and PVC - look better placed, as marginperformance
        remains strong, and is supported by healthy demand trends,supply-side reforms and inventory draw
        downs.<br/><br/>
        Key trends and outlook: Olefin margins have declined 10% since HurricaneHarvey, with naphtha cracker margins
        declining by 12% in the same timeframe tolevels last seen in 2014 (the first year of the current upcycle).
        Naphtha crackermargins have been on a downtrend since peaking at US$920/MT in 1Q17. Theyhave fallen to US$660/MT
        QTD in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        We expect olefin margins (HDPE-naphtha) to decline by 17% YoY in 2018e due tosignificant capacity growth in
        India and the US, which should drive industryutilization rates towards 2013 levels when olefin margins were ~35%
        belowcurrent levels. While the market is optimistic about potential delays, we seeunfavorable risk-reward for
        olefin producers like PTTGC and Lotte.<br/><br/>
        What did the earnings season tell us? Of the six chemicals companies that havereported third quarter earnings,
        most missed our expectations, with somehighlighting the rising discounts on olefin prices as the reason for the
        miss. Also,the price differential between premium grades of PE is starting to narrow withcommodity grades, which
        point to challenges ahead. While investors havenormally thought of gas-based chemical producers as oil price
        plays, we thinkthe underperformance of chemical prices sets the stage for 4Q17disappointment.<br/><br/>
        Will co-products save the day? While we are positive on co-products for naphthacrackers, we see the recent
        challenges for downstream demand due toenvironmental-related supply cuts affecting BD margins in the near term,
        limitingthe cushion from a fall in PE margins.<br/><br/>
        South Asia: What's Priced In? Upstream chemical equities are pricing in nodecline in margins and trade at
        above-average multiples, implying 8-12%downside risk to 2018 consensus earnings.<br/><br/>
        Korea/Taiwan: What's Priced In? We expect NCC margins to decline further toUS$540/MT by 2018 and see 14-19%
        downside risk to Lotte Chem/FPCC's 2018consensus earnings that continue to reflect peak chemical earnings.</p>
