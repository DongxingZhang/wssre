    <p> Growing on its own. As the parent of Weibo (WB US, USD99.28, Buy, TP USD106),Sina has benefited from its
        subsidiary¡¯s fast revenue and profit growth (see Weibo:Buy: Growing scale drives greater monetization, 8November
        2017) while transformingits core portal business and investing in other end markets for growth. Sina¡¯s 3Q
        resultsnot only reflected Weibo¡¯s strong performance, they also highlighted two new growthdrivers: First, the
        portal business grew for the first time in 12quarters, as the mobilenews app accounted for 63% of the total
        portal ad revenue. We now foresee modestgrowth as mobile offsets a declining PC business. Second, a 250% y-o-y
        increase inonline finance revenue drove 89% y-o-y growth in other revenue, which amounted to9% of the total net
        revenue. Weibo is monetising its B2B payment platform on a pertransaction basis and through a monthly software
        fee. It also consolidated a smallloanservice provider. We expect the market to begin to assign value to Sina¡¯s
        otherbusinesses, given that the portal has returned to growth and online finance continuesto surge. On a
        separate note, Sina¡¯s shareholders rejected an activist¡¯s proposal toappoint two new directors to its board.
        Following the annual general meeting, the newboard has issued preferred shares to Chairman Charles Chao,
        effectively increasinghis voting stake from 11.1% to 55.5%. Management continues to review options toreturn
        value to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. By end-September, Sinahad reported USD1.3bn and Weibo had
        registered USD737m in net cash. In October,Weibo completed a convertible bond offering of USD900m.<br/><br/>
        3Q results ahead of expectations. Net revenue grew 62% y-o-y, to USD443m, 10%above consensus. Advertising
        revenue grew 47% y-o-y, driven by Weibo. Core portalincreased 9% y-o-y, to USD87m, as revenue from its mobile
        news app accounted for63% of total portal ad revenue. News app monthly active users grew 30% y-o-y, andfrequency
        and time spent continued to expand year-to-date. Non-advertising revenuewas USD40m, of which the online payment
        was USD16.5m, and service revenue frommicro lending was USD12.8m. Adjusted EPS was USD0.77vs consensus of
        USD0.74.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Buy and cut SOTP-based TP to USD144. We raise our revenue forecaststo reflect faster revenue growth in
        portal and others, but lower our core Sina marginforecasts (to account for higher S&amp;M;) and reduce our EPS
        forecasts to reflect theincreased non-operating loss due to widening losses from the company¡¯s investmentin
        Leju. We increase our revenue forecast by 6% for 2017e and 8% for 2018e, but wetrim our EPS estimates by 10% and
        14%, respectively. We project an EPS CAGR of53% over 2017-20e. Mainly to factor in our lower earnings estimates,
        we cut our TPto USD144from USD170. We continue to see Sina as undervalued, given the risingvalue from its
        subsidiary Weibo and the improving performance of its portal andfinance businesses. Key downside risks include
        lower than expected monetisation ofits news app and performance of Weibo.</p>
