    <p> We expect the Stoxx 600 to end 2018 at 395, 3% above current levels, basedon projected 2018 EPS growth of 2% and
        an end-2018 12-month forward P/Eof 15.1x (slightly above the current 14.8x). We remain tactically neutral
        nearterm,but expect a pull-back of the Stoxx 600 to 375 in Q1. We are underweightEuropean cyclicals versus
        defensives ¨C and expect European equities to continueunderperforming US equities over the coming
        months.<br/><br/>
        So will today¡¯s US inflation numbers give markets an early Xmas present aftera ¡®bah humbug¡¯ last four trading
        days which has carried on overnight in theAsian session. At the moment US CPI is probably the most important
        data releaseof the month so the stakes are high. The central bank put can continue to bewithdrawn slowly and
        possibly be put back in place if needed whilst inflationremains well behaved. By well behaved the sweet spot for
        risk markets is abias for slightly missing expectations more often than it beats but without everthreatening
        deflation. This describes 2017 perfectly so far. US CPI has missedexpectations for 6 out of the last 7 months,
        with the other month being in-line.<br/><br/>
        Today we expect Core CPI (+0.2% mom vs. +0.1% previous) to firm in line withconsensus but the year-over-year
        growth rate should remain at 1.7%, down from2.3% at the beginning of the year (headline 2.0% yoy expected).<br/><br/>
        Investor appetite for EM exposures cooled considerably over the last week ascombined flows into the EM regions
        (bonds + equity) reached their lowest levelin the past three months, with global diversified EM equity mandates
        in particularsuffering first outflows after three consecutive months of gains. The outlook forEM assets has
        become less certain over the previous weeks given the potentialfor US tax reform to put upward pressures on US
        bond yields and the US dollar,while at the same time a near-term roll-over in oil should remove the tailwind
        forflows into the oil-exposed EM regions. Inflows into European equity funds on theother hand keep rising, with
        four-month high inflows last week, again supportedby active and passive inflows alike. While we don't find
        evidence of typical yearendrallies in flows, European equity funds should see another $20bn of inflowsover the
        coming six months, given they tend to lag equity performance.</p>
