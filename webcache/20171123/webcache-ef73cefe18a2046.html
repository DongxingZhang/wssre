        This will be a very busy week in Asia-Pacific, packed with 5 central bank meetings, key China data, APEC
        economic leaders¡¯ summit in Vietnam (10-11 Nov) and US President Trump¡¯s first visit to Asia. There are 5
        monetary policy decisions in Asia-Pacific this week staring with Australia (RBA, 7 Nov), Thailand (BOT, 8 Nov),
        New Zealand (9 Nov), Malaysia (BNM, 9 Nov) and Philippines (BSP, 9 Nov). Of the 5, RBNZ will be the most closely

        US AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES: Daylight Savings End In US On 5 Nov And US Tax Plan In Focus<br/><br/>
        This Friday¡¯s (3 Nov) October US labor market report will be in the spotlight and expectations are for a strong
        rebound after Sep¡¯s adverse (albeit temporary effect) on job creation. We expect 350k NFP (from -33k in Sep
        while Bloomberg median forecast is 312k, with forecast range from +120k to +400k as of 2 Nov). Unemployment rate
        may stay steady at 4.2% while US wage growth may ease a bit to +0.3%m/m, +2.8%y/y (from +0.5%m/m, 2.9%y/y in
        Sep). Note that daylight savings already ended in UK and Europe on 29 Oct while it will only end in US this week
        on 5 Nov. After a busy week in the G7 space, the paces of activity falls a notch as there will be no monetary
        policy decision from G7 economies and while the G7 data docket is quite packed this week but there is not much
        pivotal data for the markets to worry about. The focus of US domestic politics will remain on the US tax reform
        plan after the House GOP unveiled their tax plan on 2 Nov and will begin marking it up this week. The US
        earnings season continues this week with the focus on US retailers in the later part of the week. Trump will be
        in Asia for his first presidential visit to the region.</p>
