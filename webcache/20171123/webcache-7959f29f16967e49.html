        (BOJ on31 Oct), United States (FOMC on 1 Nov) and United Kingdom(BOE on 2 Nov). The US data docket is very busy
        with SepPCE (30), Oct ISM manufacturing (1), non-manufacturing (3)&amp; Sep factory orders (3) but most
        importantly, the OctoberUS labor market report (3 Nov) and expectations are for astrong rebound after Sep¡¯s
        adverse (albeit temporary effect)on job creation. We expect 350k NFP (from -33k in Sep whileBloomberg median
        forecast is 310k, with forecast rangefrom 130k to +400k as of 27 Oct). Unemployment rate maystay steady at 4.2%
        while US wage growth may ease a bitto +0.3%m/m, +2.8%y/y (from +0.5%m/m, 2.9%y/y in Sep).<br/><br/>
        The focus of US domestic politics will remain on the UStax reform plan after the House voted 216-212 to
        narrowlypass the budget resolution, and the US House Ways andMeans Chairman Kevin Brady said Committee will
        releasethe House GOP tax bill on 1 Nov and begin marking it up on6 Nov. The US earnings season continues with
        some of themost valuable US companies reporting this week. The G7data calendar outside of US is also substantial
