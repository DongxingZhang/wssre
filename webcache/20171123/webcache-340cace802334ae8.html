    <p> Singapore¡¯s non-oil domestic exports (NODX) gained back some footing in Octoberas it expanded 20.9% y/y,
        reversing the 1.1% y/y decline in September. Market wasexpecting a smaller expansion of 11.9% y/y, while we had
        expected a 15.5% y/y increase.<br/><br/>
        The on-year increase was due in part to the low base in the same month in 2016. On a m/mSA basis, NODX gained
        12.5%, after September¡¯s 11.0% drop.<br/><br/>
        Other than the low base argument, support for the strong October NODX came fromthe increase in electronics
        exports and to a larger extent, from non-electronicsexports. As we look deeper, Singapore seemed to have
        exported a lot of non-monetarygold to China in October, so much that it could have pushed the non-electronics
        exports toa new high. So, go, gold exports! But we do not think that this will last.<br/><br/>
        Electronics NODX reversed the 8.0% y/y contraction in September and registered a 4.5%y/y growth in October. The
        increase was due to expansions in the exports of ICs (+15.4%y/y), disk media products (+28.8% y/y), and PCs
        (+13.0% y/y).<br/><br/>
        Non-electronic NODX gained 28.5% y/y in October, following a much slower growth of 1.9%y/y in the previous
        month. The strong NODX growth was due to gains in the exports of nonmonetarygold (+591.5% y/y), petrochemicals
        (+22.9% y/y), and pharmaceuticals (+25.1%y/y). The on-year growth in the pharmaceuticals segment in October
        finally reversed theprevious six months of contraction. However, this segment is still down 19.3% y/y
        year-todate.<br/><br/>
        In October, exports to most of Singapore¡¯s top 10 NODX markets grew except to Taiwan,Hong Kong, and Indonesia.
        The largest contributors to the NODX increase were China(+53.3% y/y, mainly due to increase in the exports of
        non-monetary gold, petrochemicals,and measuring instruments), the EU 28 (+26.1% y/y, due to exports of
        pharmaceuticals,food preparations, and medical apparatus), and Malaysia (+22.0% y/y, due to exports of
        ICs,specialized machinery, and electric plant and parts).<br/><br/>
        Oil domestic exports grew 29.5% y/y, the 14th consecutive month of expansion, followinga 24-month decline
        previously. Higher oil prices helped to push up the nominal value of oilexports and higher sales in October were
        to Malaysia (+56.8% y/y), China (+67.4% y/y) andMarshall Islands (+89.3% y/y). We were quite surprised to see
        Marshall Islands in the list as(from memory) we have never seen it before. How will just a 54,000 population
        demand somuch oil? Could it be a strategic location due to its (relative) proximity to Guam? In volumeterms, oil
        domestic exports grew 12.7% y/y in October 2017, after the 3.9% y/y expansionin September.<br/><br/>
        Non-oil re-exports (NORX), a gauge on the regional/global trading sentiments, declinedslightly by 0.9% y/y in
        October, after the 0.6% y/y expansion a month ago. The decline is dueto lower shipment of non-electronic
        re-exports. On a m/m SA basis, NORX declined 3.2%,following the 9.8% contraction a month ago.<br/><br/>
        Today¡¯s release of October NODX may have brought a sense of relief to many since theon-year expansion rate is
        quite significant and it bounced back from a contraction in theprevious month. However, we will like to caution
        that the seemingly strong growth was onthe back of a low base in October 2016, when NODX fell 14.0% y/y then.
