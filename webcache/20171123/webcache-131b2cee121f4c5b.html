    <p> Consumer price inflation reversed September¡¯s downward surprise and stood at 0.6% m/m inOctober. The BNP Paribas
        forecast looked for a 0.4% m/m advance, while the consensusestimate stood at a slightly lower 0.3% m/m. As a
        result, annual inflation accelerated to 1.9%y/y. The core price reading stood at 0.5% m/m and its annual pace
        moved up to 2.1% y/y, thusreturning to BCCh¡¯s 2-4% tolerance range (Chart 1).<br/><br/>
        We think the October CPI print will likely downplay the deflation concerns that had been spikedby September¡¯s
        unusually low reading (-0.2% m/m; see Chile: Rates to stay put despite inflationsurprise). While inflation
        expectations for the next twelve months declined in reaction to the lowprints, the 1y/1y expectation had shown
        no deviation from the 3% official target according to thesurvey of economists (see Chile: On hold, but concerns
        about low inflation).<br/><br/>
        In light of recent inflation dynamics, we continue to expect BCCh to keep the policy rateunchanged at next
        week¡¯s monetary policy meeting (scheduled to take place on Tuesday). Weactually expect no rate changes this year
        and until Q2 2018. As the economy gathers steam,BCCh should start thinking about tightening monetary policy. We
        forecast a gradual ratenormalisation cycle to start around the middle of next year and expect the policy rate to
        stand at3.50% by end-2018, up 100 bp from the current 2.50% level.<br/><br/>
        Out of twelve CPI components, ten contributed positively to headline inflation in October. Thelargest
        contributions came from the housing and food components that together explained 60%of the headline monthly
        advance. Housing prices were mainly lifted by electricity tariffs. Theincrease in food prices happened across
        the board and was not driven by any particularcomponent. In contrast to recent trends, tradable inflation stood
        at 0.9% m/m, while nontradableprices advanced a more modest 0.3% in October.<br/><br/>
        Tradable price pressures will probably remain subdued near term as our currency forecasts donot envisage a
        weaker CLP. But the pace of nominal wages, amid a context of graduallyimproving economic trends, suggests
        non-tradable inflation (that remains slightly above theofficial 3% target, Chart 2) will accelerate.</p>
