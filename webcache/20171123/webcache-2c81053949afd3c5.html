    <p> SINGAPORE: Busy Data Week With CPI, Industrial Production &amp; Potentially Significant GDP Revision On Tap<br/><br/>
        Oct non-oil domestic exports (NODX) data surged 20.9%y/y, reversing Sep¡¯s 11% decline. This is a busy week for
        the Singapore data docket with the Oct CPI (23 Nov) and Oct industrial production (24 Nov) but attention will be
        on the final print for the 3Q GDP (23 Nov) and markets are expecting significant upward revision to 3Q and even
        the official 2017 full year growth forecast (2-3%).<br/><br/>
        KEY ASIAN ECONOMIES: Less Focus On Asia Due To Absence Of China data &amp; Central Bank Meetings<br/><br/>
        After 2 very busy weeks in Asia-Pacific due to various international/regional summits, market attention on the
        region is likely to retreat a fair bit this coming week with the absence of material Chinese data and no
        monetary policy decision scheduled in Asia- Pacific. The Asian data calendar will be headlined by 3Q 2017 GDP
        data from Thailand (20), Singapore (final print) (23) and Taiwan (final print) (24) while the other notable Asia
        data includes New Zealand October food prices (20), Taiwan Oct export orders (20), the first 20-days trade data
        from South Korea (21), Malaysia October CPI &amp; foreign reserves (22), Taiwan October unemployment rate (22),
        South Korea 3Q household credit data (22), Thai Oct customs trade data (22-27 Nov), Taiwan Oct industrial
        production (23), New Zealand October trade (24) &amp; Vietnam Nov CPI (24). And even as there is no monetary
        policy decision from the region, we will get the meeting minutes from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) (21 Nov)
        and Bank of Thailand (BOT) (22 Nov) while there will be several senior RBA officials speaking in public
        including Governor Lowe in Sydney (21 Nov).<br/><br/>
        US AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES: US Tax Plan Back In Senate¡¯s Court While UK¡¯s 22 Nov Budget In Focus<br/><br/>
        Japan and US will be celebrating their respective Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday (23 Nov) but attention will
        be clearly on US domestic politics after the House of Representatives voted 227 to 205 to pass the tax bill on
        Thursday (16 Nov), shifting the tax debate back to the Senate. The US lawmakers will be in recess before
        Thanksgiving but the Senate will be in the race to get the US tax reform proposal passed right after
        Thanksgiving. Across the Atlantic, similar attention will be on the UK as its Chancellor of the Exchequer will
        deliver the Autumn Budget statement on Wednesday (22 Nov, 8:30pm SG time) and speculation is that he may
        introduce changes to the VAT rule for small companies which will raise as much as GBP2bn annually for Treasury
        but it may send another wave of business and political backlash towards PM May¡¯s government. There will again be
        no monetary policy decision from G7 economies this week but we have the FOMC minutes on 22 Nov (23 Nov, 3am SG
        time) &amp; ECB account of the Nov monetary policy meeting (23 Nov) while FOMC Chair Yellen will speak at Sterns
        Business school (21 Nov) and ECB President Draghi peaks in Brussels in his capacity as ESRB Chair (20 Nov). This
        week¡¯s key US data includes Oct existing home sales (21), Oct durable goods orders (22) and the prelim Markit US
        manufacturing &amp; services PMI (24) but perhaps most market attention will be on US retailers¡¯ performance for
        its Black Friday holiday sales (on 24 Nov). The key data from rest of the G7 economies will be Japan¡¯s Oct trade
        data (20), UK public sector credit data (21), prelim Nov consumer confidence for the Eurozone (22), the final
        print for German 3Q GDP (23), the prelim Markit manufacturing &amp; services PMI for Eurozone and its
        constituent economies (23), German Nov IFO survey (24) and Japan¡¯s prelim Nov Nikkei manufacturing PMI (24).</p>
