    <p> Less of a beneficiary of cyclical recovery but clean and green theme intact<br/><br/>
        Except natural gas, our coverage universe has largely underperformed in 2017.Heading into 2018, we are generally
        positive on most subsectors: 1) wind -clear of green certificate overhang and with accelerated earnings
        growth;<br/><br/>
        2) environmental - stronger enforcement and improving cashflows/earningsquality; 3) gas - continued strong
        volume growth; and 4) IPPs - earningsrecovery on tariff hike/coal price fall plus potential SOE reforms. Despite
        beingless geared to a cyclical recovery, we prefer wind and environmental as theirlong-term clean and green
        theme remains intact. Our top Buys includeLongyuan, Huadian Fuxin, CEI, ENN, CR Gas, CR Power and CPI.<br/><br/>
        Wind: policy overhang to dissipate in 2018<br/><br/>
        We believe the green certificate (GC) mechanism, a key overhang for thesector in 2017, could turn out better
        than expected when it is finalized in 2018.Stress-testing of GC¡¯s NAV impact suggests current share prices have
        priced invery bearish scenarios, while we expect the sector to see accelerated earningsgrowth from continuing
        curtailment reduction and improving cashflow in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Environmental: stronger enforcement with improving cashflow<br/><br/>
        We expect this laggard sector to benefit from China strengtheningenvironmental enforcement during the last three
        years of Five-Year Planperiods (i.e. from 2018), especially as China plans to set up a "National
        NaturalResources and Ecology Administration" soon. We also see potential earningsbeats, rising proportions of
        earnings from operations and improving cashflowprofiles over the next few years.<br/><br/>
        Gas: sector growth story sustainable<br/><br/>
        Sustainable volume growth, manageable margin risks and improving free cashflows should support the gas sector¡¯s
        growth story over 2018-19. We expectsustainable coal-to-gas momentum to support a 15% gas demand CAGR
        over2017-20. Gas sales margins, on the other hand, may decline over 2018-19E ata tolerable rate. We also see
        increasing visibility on rural coal-to-gasconversions, providing connection fee income upside for gas
        distributors.<br/><br/>
        Thermal IPP: recovery on tariff hike and lower coal price<br/><br/>
        We expect IPPs¡¯ earnings to turn around in 2018-19, primarily on a tariff hike atyear-end and potentially lower
        coal prices. We expect IPPs¡¯ ROE to recover toc.9% in 2018, making current valuations attractive (8x 2018E P/E
        and 0.75xP/B, 5-8% dividend yield). Meanwhile, the sector is one of the key potentialbeneficiaries of the SOE
        reform, with corporate restructurings likely.HK Utilities: sector fully valued amid rising yield environmentWe
        still think the sector is fully valued, with a rising outlook for the US treasuryyield and the stocks only
        offering a dividend yield ~1.5% above the US yield.Among the Hold-rated stocks, our relative preference is for
        CKI on earningspotentially benefiting from rising UK inflation and M&amp;A.;<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We use DCF as the major valuation tool for utilities, given their visible cashflow profile, except for some
        multi-business players (for which we use SOTP).Industry risks include demand variance causing top-line
        volatility, changes ininput costs without a pass-through, interest rate hikes and policy risk.</p>
