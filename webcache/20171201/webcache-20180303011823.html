    <p> Different direction of guidance but seeing the same type of treatment. The three leading HK-listed
        semi-conductor foundries ¡ª ASMC [3355.HK], HuaHong [1347.HK] and SMIC [0981.HK] ¡ª reported their Q3 2017 results
        and highlighted the outlook for Q4 2017. The divergence in their operating performancecontinued in Q3 2017, and
        guidance on the outlook released by management of the foundries is also different. Hua Hong management
        reiterated itspositive guidance for Q4 2017 and early 2018, and ASMC management remains cautiously optimistic
        about the Q4 2017 outlook, but SMIC managementhighlighted that the near-term outlook, especially Q4 2017 and Q1
        2018, is somewhat uncertain. Based on our understanding, the divergence is somewhatdue to different technology
        nodes, product mix, capacity expansion schedules and client mix. At this stage, 8¡± capacity is st ill tight,
        given more attractive coststructure along the supply chain (IC design + foundries + packaging and testing). It
        seems that 12¡± capacity is facing more competition in the near term, butthis situation is likely to change going
        forward, with lower costs in the packaging and testing segment. We believe that the lower technology node
        (HuaHong) is also facing less competition from global players, and this situation is likely to continue in 2018.
        We think that the foundries using lower technologynodes, especially Hua Hong, should continue to outperform SMIC
        in terms of operating results in the coming quarters, given their better market positioningand more stable
        profitability. Therefore, in the foundry segment, Hua Hong¡¯s price is expected to outperform SMIC¡¯s in the near
        term. We would not be surprisedto see SMIC¡¯s weaker-than-expected outlook to be a drag on sentiment on the
        HK-listed IC related names for a while. But we maintain the view thatthe Chinese government will continue to
        promote the localization of high-end upstream electronic components and that the whole IC supply chain will be
        oneof the beneficiaries of this trend. We continue to suggest investors broaden their radar screens from
        foundries to IC design names (CE Huada [0085.HK],Solomon Systech [2878.HK] and Shanghai Fudan [1385.HK]),
        materials (AVIC Int¡¯l [0161.HK]¡¯s Shannan Circuits), and equipment (ASMPT [0522.HK]) tocapture the growth
        potential. Regarding foundries, after their re-rerating, we suggest investors wait for a better re-entry
        opportunity.<br/><br/>
        SMIC [0981.HK]. SMIC¡¯s Q3 2017 turnover was US$769.7m, up by 2.5% QoQ (close to high end of the previously
        guided range), from US$751.2m in Q22017, and down 0.7% YoY, from US$774.8m in Q3 2016. The QoQ turnover growth
        in Q3 2017 was mainly due to increased wafer shipments and demandrecovery on the smartphone side. In terms of
        applications, power management ICs, NOR flash and fingerprint contributed sequen tial growth. SMIC¡¯s Q32017
        gross margin was 23.0%, (lower than previous guidance of 23 to 25%), down 2.8ppt QoQ, partly due to a lower
        utilization rate. SMIC¡¯s utilization ratedropped from 85.7% in Q2 017 to 83.9% in Q3 2017. SMIC¡¯s R&amp;D;
        expenses decreased US$4.3m QoQ to $107m in Q3 2017. Funding of R&amp;D; from thegovernment was US$24.2m in Q3
        2017, up from US$16.1m in 2Q 2017. SMIC¡¯s net profit of US$25.9m in Q3 17 was higher than our expectation
        ofUS$23.2m. In our view, the higher-than-expected Q3 2017 results were due to lower operating expenses. The
        ramping-up of sales of 28nm is the positivepoint in the Q3 2017 results, as 28nm sales as a percentage of total
        sales increased from 6.6% in Q2 2017 to 8.8% in Q3 2017.SMIC management guidedthat a) turnover in Q4 2017 would
        be from 1% to 3% QoQ; b) the gross margin would range from 18% to 20%; and c) operating expenses would beUS$204m
        to US$210m (not including employee bonuses, government funding and disposal gains). The 4Q guidance is below our
        and market expectations,especially the gross margin, which is due to a shift in the product mix, higher
        depreciation and price erosion. Non-controlling interest, according to management,was US$$48-50m due to an R&amp;D;
        sharing charge for 28nm in Q4 2017. Depreciation charges were guided at US$255m and full-year deprecation willbe
        US$975m. SMIC management didn¡¯t provide any quantified guidance for Q1 2018, but it will be a low season, given
        seasonal adjustments in the mobilecommunication industry. However, SMIC management still looks for a top-line
        CAGR of 20% in the next 3-4 years, and the margin is likely to rebound in2018. During the conference call, SMIC
        management highlighted that the Company¡¯s strategic targets include maintaining profitability, top-line growth
        andthe ratio of its leading technology in revenue. Regarding 28nm platforms, PolySiON is in mass production and
        HKC+ started risk production in Q3 2017.<br/><br/>
        SMIC management expects 28nm products to account for 10% of the top line in Q4 2017. SMIC has started R&amp;D;
        on 22nm, and 14nm FinFET productionwill start in 2019.The 14nm node will enter risk production, with the
        schedule unchanged in 2019. Management highlighted that SMIC will remain a beneficiaryof the development of
        local IC supply chain and sees the China fabless industry growing at a 20% CAGR in the coming years. Management
        highlightedthat in Sep 2017 SMIC announced the first NB-IoT chip designed by ZTE. This chip is based on SMIC¡¯s
        55nm ULP+RF+eFlash technology, which can beused in smart meters, shared bikes, smart devices, smart cities, etc.
        SMIC and Chengdu Analog Circuit Tech (ACTT), a leading analog IP provider, announcedthe availability of ACTT¡¯s
        analog IP on SMIC¡¯s 55nm eFlash technology. SMIC¡¯s 2017 foundry CAPEX guidance remained at US$2.3bn. The
        Company¡¯sCAPEX is based on customer commitments, and part of the burden can be shared with its JV partners.
        SMIC¡¯s 2018 CPAEX will not increase significantlyfrom the level in 2017.SMIC has no difficult in securing raw
        wafer supply, and the recent tight supply of wafers has h ad no impact on SMIC.<br/><br/>
        Hua Hong [1347.HK]. Hua Hong¡¯s Q3 2017 turnover was US$209.9m, reaching an all-time high, up by 6.0% QoQ from
        US$198.1m in Q2 2017 (strongerthan guidance released in Aug 2017) and up by 13.3% YoY from US$185.3m in Q3 2017.
        The Company¡¯s Q3 2017 gross margin was 35.2%, (higher thanprevious guidance of 33%), up 2.0ppt QoQ, primarily
        due to improved product mix, high utilization and higher average selling price (ASP). Operating expenseswere
        US$29.3m in Q3 2017, up 7.2% QoQ, primarily due to a) higher labour costs and b) RMB appreciation. Hua Hong
        reported a net profit ofUS$35.3m in Q3 2017, up 2.3% QoQ, and 18.5% YoY. However, we would like to point out
        that the QoQ and YoY net profit growth in Q3 2017 was distortedby increased accruals dividend withholding tax.
        Hua Hong management mentioned that every business segment continues to show strong growth in Q42017 and that
        regarding applications, smart cards, smart card ICs, MCUs, super-junction IGBTs and power management ICs are all
        seeing strong demand.<br/><br/>
        Hua Hong management expects approximately 3% revenue growth and the gross margin to be in the range of 33% to
        34% in Q4 2017. According to HuaHong management, the sequential drop in gross margin in Q4 2017 is due to market
        year-end activities, such as bonus and changes in the product mix.<br/><br/>
        Overall, given strong demand, Hua Hong management expects the Company¡¯s ASP to continue to improve in Q4 2017
        and 1H 2018. Hua Hong is trying toexpand capacity by de-bottlenecking and the Company is also looking for M&amp;A;
        activity (the parent owns a 12¡± fab). Hua Hong is trying maximize profitability,given strong downstream demand.
        Hua Hong will add 2-3k wafer capacity by the end of 2017. Management will focus more on profitability than
        salesgrowth.</p>
