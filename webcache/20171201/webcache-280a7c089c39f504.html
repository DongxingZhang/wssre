    <p> Germany: downgrade from overweight to underweight. German equities haveoutperformed the European benchmark by 6%
        since we upgraded the countryfrom underweight to overweight in mid-August. We now downgrade Germanequities to
        underweight again, given that: a) German equities¡¯ price relativeno longer looks too low relative to the
        trajectory suggested by Euro area PMImomentum; b) Germany has overshot its correlation with the euro
        trade-weightedindex which our FX strategists¡¯ expect to stay around current levels until year-end;c) our country
        model, based on the trade-weighted euro and the performanceof cyclicals versus defensives implies more than 5%
        underperformance overthe coming months; and d) unlike three months ago, the index looks slightlyexpensive on our
        country valuation scorecard.<br/><br/>
        After a chilly day yesterday, markets heat up today and tomorrow with China'smonthly data dump just out (see
        below) and lots of global inflation data out todayand tomorrow. We also have an audience with the four most
        important centralbankers in the world at 10am GMT this morning hosted by the ECB in Frankfurtwhich will be a
        rare and interesting opportunity to hear from the fantastic four onone stage. However it's not likely to be
        ground breaking given that Yellen is soonto be replaced, Draghi is figuratively leaning back deep into his
        armchair for a fewmonths, Kuroda is unlikely to change course soon (see comments from yesterdaybelow) and Carney
        is waiting on Brexit developments. Elsewhere UK PM May¡¯sBrexit legalisation (the EU withdrawal bill) is the
        subject of two days of line-bylineexamination in Commons.</p>
