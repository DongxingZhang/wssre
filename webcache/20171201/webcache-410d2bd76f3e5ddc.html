    <p> China intends to revise OCC contaminant threshold to 0.5%.<br/><br/>
        According to the Bureau of International Recycling (BIR), on November 15, Chinanotified the WTO that it intends
        to control the percentage of contaminants inimported OCC to 0.5% with new rules due to be published on December
        31,2017 and implementation on March 1, 2018. (See "Environmental ProtectionControl Standard for Imported Solid
        Wastes as Raw Materials - Waste and Scrapof Paper or Paperboard (GB 16487.4 - 2017".) The contaminants
        percentage forimported OCC is currently 1.5%, based on Chinese regulations published in 2005,but was revised to
        0.3% in the initial draft released in August 2017; however,such stringent requirements generated many protests
        globally. The protests ledto speculation that China would revise the percentage to 1%, but this appears tohave
        indeed just been speculation. If there are no further changes to the 0.5%standard, which differs a lot from what
        is currently followed by global recyclingcommunities, this could lead to a significant cost push to Chinese
        paper producerssince they will be forced to use more expensive higher imported OCC grades.<br/><br/>
        While a cost push normally suggests higher domestic paper prices, China alreadyboasts the most expensive paper
        prices globally, so further prices hikes shouldnot be expected. On the contrary, this creates an opportunity for
        more finishedpaper imports into China in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Imported OCC prices structurally higher for Chinese mills.<br/><br/>
        While the OCC contaminants threshold has yet to be determined, we knowthat imported OCC will need to be of a
        higher quality going forward, becausethe import of ¡°unsorted waste paper¡± will also be banned, starting January
        1,2018. Based on Chinese standards, the benchmark US#11 OCC contains 1%contaminants and, according to DB's US
        paper analyst, many US recyclers aregetting away with a 1.5% contaminant level for waste paper being shipped
        toChina currently. In order to comply with the new standard of 0.5%, considerablesums will need to be invested
        so that assets can be upgraded accordingly. If the0.5% contaminant level sticks, Chinese paper mills will be
        forced to import themore expensive US#12 waste paper, which fits the 0.5% standard and which isUSD15-40/t more
        expensive. Even excluding the contaminant factor, we estimate8mt, or 28% of imported OCC, will have to be
        upgraded or rearranged basedon 2017 numbers, including 6.1mt of unsorted waste paper and 1.9mt sorted bypaper
        mills with capacity of less than 300k.<br/><br/>
        Paper mills' margins to be squeezed further next year.<br/><br/>
        In 2H17, large paper mills in China enjoyed an unprecedented advantage, giventhe surprise import ban since May
        2017 and the subsequent crash in US OCC.</p>
