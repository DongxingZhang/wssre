    <p> A secular growth sector<br/><br/>
        We analyze the supply and demand of China¡¯s limited service hotels (economyhotels) and conclude that the sector
        will see secular growth (RevPAR growth of6% CAGR) in the next five years. We believe the like-for-like hotel
        average dailyrate (ADR) for both economy and midscale hotels will continue to grow to meetconsumers¡¯ trade-up
        demand. Meanwhile, on a blended basis, we believe theshort supply of midscale hotels will continue to increase
        its percentage of thetotal, leading to a favorable mix change (40% of new hotel additions will bemid- to
        high-scale hotels).<br/><br/>
        Hotels are a leveraged business, RevPAR is the key<br/><br/>
        Changes in operating cost per room (excluding rent) are manageable foreconomy and midscale hotels; hence to
        maximize profit, the key is to increaseRevPAR. The two largest costs in operating economy hotels are: 1) staff
        cost(already manageable at a staff-to-room ratio of 0.18-0.2), and 2) rent cost,which is normally fixed for
        15-20years. We believe the two key drivers toincreasing RevPAR in the next five years are: 1) a higher
        percentage ofupgraded economy hotels and 2) a higher percentage of midscale hotels.<br/><br/>
        Economy segment has likely bottomed<br/><br/>
        We believe 2016was the trough for economy hotels¡¯ RevPAR as the high hotelsupply growth is likely to slow
        significantly in the next five years (6-7% CAGRvs. 38% CAGR over 2006-16). We believe the sharp decline in
        economy hoteladditions, from 5k in 2015to 2k in 2016, is a turnaround point for the sector as1) loss-making
        franchisees leave the market; 2) property supply for hotels isbeing tightened; and 3) both HomeInns and 7Days
        have been delisted andacquired by BTG and Jinjiang, respectively. We forecast a stable 2k neweconomy hotel
        additions over the next five years, a 6-7% CAGR.<br/><br/>
        Midscale segment¡¯s barriers to entry remain high<br/><br/>
        While the economy segment started in 2005, the mid-scale segment onlyemerged in 2010. Given the government¡¯s
        anti-corruption campaign, demandfor high-end hotels is shifting to midscale hotels, and alongside
        consumerstrading up, we believe midscale hotels¡¯ RevPAR (8% CAGR) should be higherthan economy hotels¡¯ (3% CAGR
        over 2018-2022E). The barriers to entry formidscale hotels are much higher than for economy hotels, as: 1)
        initiationinvestment for franchisee is 4-5x higher, 2) property criteria is morecomplicated, and 3)
        brand/product designs are more demanding.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We initiate coverage of BTG with a Buy rating and TP of RMB35(25% upsidepotential). We also slightly lift China
        Lodging¡¯s TP to USD130. We maintainBuy on Jinjiang with TP unchanged. We change our primary valuation
        fromEV/EBTIDA to DCF as we view DCF as a better methodology to capture seculargrowth over the medium term. We
        use EV/EBITDA as a check on the targetvaluations. Risks include: 1) lower tourism demand; 2) stronger RMB
        leading tomore outbound travel; and 3) government policy changes.</p>
