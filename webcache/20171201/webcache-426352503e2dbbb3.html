        Nickel deficit expected to deepen as Electric Vehicle (EV) market expands.<br/><br/>
        Sales of passenger EV¡¯s expected to rise from 2.4m in 2016 to 14.2m in 2025,which implies an increase from 26
        GWh to 215 GWh in battery terms. Nickeldemand in EV batteries is expected to increase from 40kt in 2016 to 220kt
        in2025, with total demand reaching 275kt if other battery applications areincluded. However, current supply is
        not suitable for battery applications,suggesting that increasing demand could lead to a deficit. (Wood

        US Commerce Department sets preliminary antidumping duties of 3-148% onsteel wire rod imports from Italy (22%),

        US preliminary steel imports decreased 10% MoM to 3.1m st in September (-1% vs permits, +10% YoY). Finished
        steel imports were 2.4m st (flat MoM,+15% YoY), with coated sheets declining the most MoM (-65kt, -15%),followed
        by CRC (-36kt, -14%) offset by higher line pipes (+72kt, +35%) and oilcountry tubular goods (+60kt, +23%).
        Import share estimated at 27% inSeptember (~28% YTD), with total and finished steels annualizing to 39m st(+20%
        YoY) and 30m st (+15%). (US Census Bureau, DB).</p>
