    <p> The minutes of the BCCh¡¯s November monetary policy meeting (when the central bankunanimously decided to keep the
        policy rate unchanged) show a board that is slightly lessconcerned about downside inflation risks. Indeed,
        October¡¯s (upside) inflation surprise helpedmitigate deflation concerns sparked by the unexpected negative CPI
        print in September. Theoptions considered in November were the same as in October: to remain on hold, or to
        ease25bp.<br/><br/>
        The inflation surprises have related mostly to volatile prices, according to BCCh. Underlyinginflation, in
        contrast, has stood fairly in line with the official base case scenario. The fact thatgrowth has started to
        accelerate and that confidence measures have improved was alsocomforting to the central bank and moderated
        medium-term downside inflation risks.<br/><br/>
        According to the minutes, the key development for the central bank since it said that rate cutscould be
        necessary in the October statement related to the change in real rates. Indeed, theminutes explicitly mention
        that the increase in real rates had been the main concern in Octoberand that this concern had become less
        relevant more recently.<br/><br/>
        Indeed, rates have returned to levels similar to those prevailing when the September MonetaryPolicy Report
        (IPoM) was published, the minutes highlighted. Hence, the board¡¯s conclusionthat the expansive stance of
        monetary policy had not been reduced ¡ª a risk that had beenpresent a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>
        The reduction in inflation expectations was also highlighted as a risk factor. However, that hasbecome less
        relevant lately. In fact, the reduction in 2-year inflation expectations has notcontinued recently.<br/><br/>
        The monetary authority will analyse these variables and risks in detail in the upcoming IPoM (tobe published in
        December). We currently call for no rate changes near term. We expect thecentral bank to start removing the
        monetary stimulus gradually from Q2 2018 against thebackdrop of a stronger growth environment and a narrower
        output gap.</p>
