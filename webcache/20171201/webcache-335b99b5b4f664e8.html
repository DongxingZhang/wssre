    <p> Indonesia government announced on Monday that it has given out 20.3mnt ofnickel ore export quota (equal to 213kt
        Ni, assuming average nickel grade at1.5%, moist 30%) to several Indonesian nickel miners. This is higher than
        ourexpectation of only 15-16mnt of nickel ore quota for 12-months. The headlinequota may sound negative but in
        reality the export quota volume has beentame with only 2.7mnt as of November the 3rd. With the raining season
        arrived,Indonesia may potentially missed the expectation of exporting of up to 6mnt ofnickel ore this year.<br/><br/>
        The big question for next year is whether Indonesia will export all the 20mntof nickel ore quota and will flood
        the global market again? Although there is apossibility to export the full quota, we believe Indonesia at best
        can export 15mntof nickel ore next year. This is because we expect the government to impose strictrules over
        export quota where miners must follow their commitment on smelterdevelopment through 6 months regular checks.
        This will cause some of the quotato be revoked as we don't think most of miners are able to build smelters due
        tofinancial issues. Hence, we are not too concerned about the headline numbers.</p>
