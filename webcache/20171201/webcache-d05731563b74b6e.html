    <p> The smaller monthly increase in prices in October compared to the 0.5% MoMincrease in the previous month, has
        translated to a 0.3pps drop in annual inflation.<br/><br/>
        Annual inflation, has thereby resumed its declining trend, after two months ofincrease and we believe it will
        reach 4.3% YoY by year-end. Core inflation has alsodecelerated in October by 0.1pps to 4.5% YoY, in line with
        our forecasts, to postthe lowest reading since July-2012.<br/><br/>
        Housing costs inflation has declined by 0.8pps to 0.1% MoM, led mainly by aslowdown in rents growth. Inflation
        in transportation costs has decelerated, alsoby 0.8pps, to 0.9% MoM on the back of lower inflation in petrol
        prices, personalvehicle operation costs and public transportation charges. On the other hand,food price
        inflation has jumped to 0.8% MoM, the first positive reading in threemonths, with almost all subcomponents
        posting higher gains in October.<br/><br/>
        Inflation in transportation costs has slowed on the back of a lower monthlyincrease in fuel prices as well as
        personal vehicle operating costs, falling to 5.4%YoY in October (from 5.6% YoY previously). Annual inflation in
        food prices havealso declined to a 23 month low of 5.3% YoY on the back of a higher base, despitethe monthly
        increase in prices. However, a lower base in housing costs, meantthat despite the monthly fall, annual inflation
        has increased to 5.1% YoY (from4.9% YoY).<br/><br/>
        Headline inflation has been declining since April this year, led by lower food prices,a smaller increase in
        electricity tariffs than previously, a strengthening exchangerate and falling ULCs. Despite the spike in
        inflation in August and September,mainly due to higher housing costs and higher petrol prices, we expect
        inflationto decline further to 4.3% by year-end. However, risks to our inflation forecasts liefirmly to the
        upside for this year and in 2018. Credit downgrades in November andpotential outflows would impact core
        inflation via renewed currency depreciation.<br/><br/>
        Inflation expectations remain higher than the headline and firmly anchored ataround 6%. House price indicators
        also show renewed upward momentum.<br/><br/>
        Further risks stem from the request from Eskom to increase electricity tariffsfor 2018-19 by over 18.9% for
        direct customers and 26.9% for municipalities.<br/><br/>
        The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) is expected to announce its decision on 7th December. If
        approved, the increase would come into effecton April 1, 2018 for direct customers and July 1, 2018 for
        municipalities. Theapplication from Eskom is for one year only after NERSA approved a deviationfrom the
        multi-year price determination methodology.</p>
