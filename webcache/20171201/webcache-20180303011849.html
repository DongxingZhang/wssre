    <p> Secular growth story intact, led by continuous "price" hike in the long term<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our Buy and raise our TP slightly to USD 130. In addition tosecular growth, we believe China
        Lodging, as industry leader, will enjoy apremium on both RevPAR and growth over its competitors. Furthermore,
        webelieve its strategy, to strengthen its network of midscale hotels (favorable¡°mix up¡±), will further improve
        the blended RevPAR. We slightly cut our 2017Eprofit by 2% to factor in Crystal Orange. Although Crystal Orange
        contributedtop-line/RevPAR growth significantly, its margin may be lower than the originalChina Lodging
        business, on its higher portion of lease and owned hotels.<br/><br/>
        3Q17EBITDA growth in-line, record-high growth, but it¡¯s NOT the end of story<br/><br/>
        China Lodging reported 3Q17EBITDA growth of 55% yoy today (or 38% yoyexcluding contribution from Crystal
        Orange). This is in line with the market andour expectation. The company further guided that although Oct RevPar
        growthslowed slightly for some one-off reasons, Nov RevPAR was as strong as Q3and they are confident that Dec
        RevPAR growth should also be healthy. Inaddition, we have seen management¡¯s confidence on the high
        growthpotential of the mid-high scale hotel segment, as they guided an acceleratedpace in new store openings in
        2018E. Management expects to open 650-700new stores (gross opening) in 2018E and 60-65% will be mid-high scale
        hotels.<br/><br/>
        ¡°3keys¡± in managing the long-term RevPAR growth<br/><br/>
        We believe there is still potential for China Lodging to drive up its RevPAR inthe long term: a) although the
        reported occupancy rate has hit 90%+ high,c.10% is contributed by paid-by-hour hotels. Thus, the stay-over
        occupancyrate is c. 80%, meaning there is still potential for further improvement; b) ADRon a same hotel basis
        should continue to rise, as more hotels renovate andupgrade; and c) as it continues to enhance the expansion of
        midscale hotels,the favorable ¡°mix up¡± is estimated to contribute at least 4% RevPAR growth.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We change our primary valuation to DCF (9.2% WACC and 3% TGR) fromEV/EBITDA, as we view DCF as a better
        valuation methodology to capture: 1)secular growth; 2) strong cash flow generation; and 3) the asset light
        businessmodel over the medium term. It is currently trading at 2018EV/EBITDA of 12x,higher than BTG¡¯s 11x and
        Jinjiang¡¯s 10x, for its industry leader status andhigher EBITDA growth. Risks: 1) lower tourism demand; 2) a
        stronger RMB,leading to more outbound travel; and 3) government policy changes.</p>
