    <p> Jinjiang is also on the way of products upgrade<br/><br/>
        We reiterate Buy on Jinjiang Hotels with a TP of RMB37. We believe Jinjiangis also in the process of upgrading
        its product to meet higher demand fromChinese customers' trading-up, especially in tier 1-2cities. We also
        believe thecompany will start to focus on internal consolidation of its current four hotelbrands and that it is
        likely to halt further expansion through acquisition.Earnings growth driven by new brand full-year
        consolidation; RevPAR growthRecall, 9M17core earnings increased by 62% yoy to RMB494m (vs. RMB306min 9M16). This
        is mainly due to 1) Plateno and Vienna¡¯s full-year consolidationin 2017, 2) reduced cost and expenses after
        acquisition, and 3) 9M17JinjiangRevPAR growth of 4.3% (9M17blended RevPAR growth of 6-7% if excludingVAT reform
        effect), driven by the Chinese economy hotels¡¯ recovery.<br/><br/>
        Midscale hotels expansion driven by Vienna<br/><br/>
        The hotel sector's recovery is mainly due to the robust domestic travel growth.In addition, mid-high-scale
        economy hotels' growth is driven by the rise indemand of domestic and business travelers, as well as consumer
        trade-up.Jinjiang is upgrading its products aggressively to mid-to-upscale hotels, mainlythrough the Vienna
        brand, just like China Lodging's strategy for more mid-toupscalehotels and the Hanting upgrade. Management had
        guided previouslythat more than 1,000hotels were mid-scale out of a total of 6,503hotels inoperation as of 9M17.
        In addition, 50-60% of the hotel portfolio pipelines aremidscale. As of 9M17, the Vienna brand led the midscale
        hotel marketexpansion with more than 300hotels added in 2017YTD.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        TP based on SOTP methodology (12-month weighted average EV/EBITDA);<br/><br/>
        Jinjiang operates in multiple business segments (we use DCF as the primarymethodology for other hotel companies
        to capture secular growth over themedium term). We separately calculate EBIDTA of Jinjiang¡¯s Chinese andoverseas
        selected hotel businesses. We assign a 12x multiple to Hotel Louvre,which is in line with the high end of
        European peers. We assign a 14x multipleto Plateno (7days) and the original Jinjiang Chinese selected hotel
        business,which is the average for peers. Downside risks: 1) lower tourism demand; 2)stronger RMB, leading to
        more outbound travel; and 3) govt policy changes.</p>
