    <p> Worst case scenario avoided¡­While S&amp;P; downgraded South Africa¡¯s foreign and local debt to non-investment
        grade on Friday last week, Moody¡¯s placed both foreign- and local-currency government bonds ¡°only¡± on review for
        a downgrade. In other words, Moody¡¯s maintains its sovereign rating for South Africa at Baa3, which is one notch
        above non-investment grade. Particularly of interest was the decision for the local debt rating given that a
        downgrade to non-investment grade would have triggered an exclusion in the WGBI.<br/><br/>
        In this report we show why a potential downgrade by Moody¡¯s is clearly not off the table, but all eyes will be
        on the upcoming ANC conference as the next event risk.<br/><br/>
        We alsoprovide a quick update on the most important variables for South Africa¡¯s fixed income market that
        further justify our trade recommendations.</p>
