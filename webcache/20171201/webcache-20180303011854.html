    <p> Valuation<br/><br/>
        Alibaba issued initial price guidance for its 5.5yr, 10yr, 20yr, 30yr, 40yr bondsat 100bp, 125-130bp, 140bp,
        160bp, 180bp area respectively. We see fairvalue for the 5.5/10/20/30/40yr tranches at around 80bp, 100bp,
        110bp-115bp,120-125bp and 135-140bp, excluding new issue concession (Figure 1). While itcould take some time, we
        see the bonds eventually settling in this context. Ingeneral, we have a preference for either the shorter dated
        or very long bondsin Asia IG, with least preference for the 10yr ones currently. We start withanchoring the 10yr
        point first. Alibaba's own 2024s and Tencent 2025s are at~90bp (G-spd), and high quality SOEs like State Grid
        2027s at about 100bp.Note that the 2027bonds for similar rated US tech names are trading tighter,inside 80bp
        (Figure 4). From the 10yr point, we use 20bp for the 5/10curveand 20-25bp for the 10/30curve. The 10/30curve for
        Asia is generally quite flatand even inverted in some cases, so we use the 20-25bp pick up that's beingpriced in
        the US peers. The 30yr bonds for high single-A rated China SOEs arein the 110-130bp context. For the 30/40curve,
        given lack of 40yr bonds inAsia, we again use US peers that have a 15bp spread pick up. Key downsiderisks are
        weak market technical, large deal size, further supply in the Chinatech space, VIE structure, and aggressive
        growth/expansion/M&amp;A;, whileupside risks include solid fundamentals, etc.<br/><br/>
        Technicals<br/><br/>
        Asia credit markets in general and China IG in particular have been weak onthe back of heavy supply post the
        sovereign deal. So overall technicals areclearly not great. However, technicals for Alibaba should eventually be
        strong,partly from lack of bond supply in the space as China tech companies havepreferred accessing the loan
        market in recent years (Figure 2). Total sectorsupply has been just USD12billion in the past 3years. Alibaba
        itself has notissued any bond after its USD8billion debut, but raised ~USD9billion from theloan market
        afterwards. Plus, Chinese corporates have mainly been tappingthe Reg S only market, with less than 10% of their
        new issues this year havinga 144A leg (per Bloomberg). Hence, Alibaba is a rare 144A bond from a qualityissuer.
        It should also get demand from the US IG investors. Tech supply in USYTD is largely in line with last year
        (Figure 3), and even individual issues havegenerally performed well (Figure 6).Separately, recent headlines ¨C
        better-thanexpected2Q results, strong singles day sales and large market cap of USD478billion (as we write) ¨C
        should be supportive.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentals<br/><br/>
        Alibaba¡¯s fundamentals remain solid with dominant market position, net cashbalance sheet and positive FCF
        generation. Alibaba continued momentum inrevenues and active consumer additions into the latest quarter.
        2Q18revenuewas up 61% yoy, the highest growth rate since its IPO, to RMB55billion.EBITDA was RMB25billion.
        Number of annual active customers also grewsignificantly during the quarter, with a net increase of 22million
        qoq to 488million. Leverage has been trending down to 1.0x and liquidity position isexceptionally strong with
        net cash position of RMB76billion. Despite its solidfundamentals, we believe the likelihood for a rating upgrade
        is low. Alibaba isnow rated A1/A+/A+ by Moody¡¯s/S&amp;P;/Fitch, same as the China sovereign. Itmight be very
        difficult for Alibaba which derives ~90% of its revenues/profit inChina to be rated higher than the sovereign.
