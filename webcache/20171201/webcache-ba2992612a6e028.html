    <p> Chinese heating season positive for high grade Fe, negative for low grade.<br/><br/>
        Recent iron ore and steel data shows that the Chinese heating season is indeedpositive for high grade iron ore
        and negative for low grade. Australian port datashows BHP, RIO and Hancock have been performing strongly in
        November andare all running in-line with guidance (270-275, 330, 50), however FMG andUtah Point (MIN and AGO)
        have been operating over 20% below Octoberexport levels. Chinese port data shows BHP and RIO¡¯s inventory is
        steady,whereas FMG¡¯s has climbed. Low grade remains under pressure. Lumppremiums have retraced on higher
        production from BHP and RIO.<br/><br/>
        Iron ore equities: prefer high grade majors.<br/><br/>
        Chinese steel mill utilisation rates have fallen to below 50% in Tangshan butthe 62% Fe price remains resilient
        above US$60/t and our US$55/t forecast for4Q17 now appears to have some upside risk. Our Top global picks are
        the highgrade majors RIO, BHP and Vale.<br/><br/>
        Australian port data shows FMG and Utah shipments down in November.<br/><br/>
        Bloomberg shipping data from individual berths in Western Australia forOctober and November (days 1-20) shows
        that BHP, RIO and Roy Hill allperforming strongly, but exports from FMG and Utah Point have declined
        sinceSeptember (see Figures 5&amp;6). BHP shipped at a rate of 266Mtpa in Octoberand is running at 289Mtpa in
        November, RIO 365mtpa in October but weakerat 342Mtpa in November. BHP¡¯s guidance for FY18 is 275-280Mt so they
        arein-line. RIO¡¯s guidance is ¡°around 330Mt¡± and they need to ship at around355Mtpa in Dec Q to hit guidance.
        FMG¡¯s shipments have weakened however,falling from 172Mtpa in September, to 161Mtpa in October, and just
        129Mtpain November. We think the fall might be due to a combination of scheduledmaintenance but also higher
        discounts for lower grade product during Chineseheating season. Utah Point exports have also declined sharply,
        from 25Mtpa inAugust to 19Mtpa in November.<br/><br/>
        Chinese port data shows further low grade inventory build-up.<br/><br/>
        The Mysteel Chinese port stocks at the key 16 ports shows stocks sit at 139Mtsplit 89Mt of 60-65% ore, 41Mt of
        56-60% material and 8Mt of lower grade 50-56% Fe ore. BHP and RIO¡¯s inventory has been steady at around 10Mt
        or10days, however FMG¡¯s stocks have been increasing and now stand at 19mtor 39 days of annual production (low of
        12 days early 2017).<br/><br/>
        Non-traditional shipments steady, Chinese domestic production down.<br/><br/>
        The Chinese iron ore imports from the non-traditional suppliers (excl. Australiaand Brazil) have remained steady
        at c.16Mt (annualising c. 190Mtpa) inSeptember. Chinese domestic iron ore concentrate production has been
        ondownward trend since April, reaching c. 254Mtpa (62% Fe Eq) in mid ofNovember (see Figure 8).</p>
