    <p> A mild revenue guidance and margin pressure gave us further conviction that Vipshop needs strategic partners to
        fully leverage expanding consumption scenarios. Otherwise, we are increasingly concerned that Vipshop may suffer
        from prolonged earnings moderation. In the worst scenario, it may lose market share even in its core apparel
        category to larger multi-category competitors. To reflect rising competitive pressure and fulfillment
        infrastructure expansion, we lower our 2017-19E non-GAAP net profit estimates by 6%-14%, and lower our target
        price to US$11.50 (from US$14.00) based on 15.2x 2018E P/E (10% discount to its three-year median). Again, our
        positive stance on Vipshop is based on likely M&amp;A; events which help accelerate its market share gain.
        Downside risks: slower user gain, larger margin contraction, and consumer habit change.<br/><br/>
        Outlook: needs partners to fuel users and monetization. Management guided to 20%-25% YoY revenue growth for
        4Q17E, which was below our expectation and JD.com¡¯s (JD US, Buy, TP US$53.00) 4Q17 guidance of 35%-39%. The
        online competition is more intensified than before. Despite that Vipshop¡¯s continuous endeavors (in precise
        marketing, category expansion, and penetration of VIP membership) is yielding positive effects including larger
        ticket size and higher order frequency, we believe Vipshop also needs strong traffic partners for accelerated
        user gain and higher monetization amid expanding consumption scenarios. We think this is one of the Street¡¯s
        focus on Vipshop at this moment.<br/><br/>
        Review: 3Q17 hit in revenue while missed in margins. Vipshop¡¯s non-GAAP net profit declined by 7% YoY to RMB560m
        in 3Q17, on a mixture of 28% revenue growth (at the top end of guidance range), gross margin contraction, and
        increased fulfilment cost. The 28% revenue increase was driven by 4% YoY growth in average ticket size and 23%
        order growth (including 15% active customer gain and 7% increase in orders per active customer). Gross margin
        contracted by 1.6ppts YoY to 22.9% in 3Q17, due to promotion for market share gain and rising contribution from
        low-margin categories. Non-GAAP fulfilment cost surged by 63% YoY in 3Q17 (10.8% of revenue, vs 8.5% in 3Q16),
        given the expansion of last-mile network for internal and external orders. Meanwhile, Vipshop reduced marketing
        expenses by 23% YoY in 3Q17 (3.1% of revenue, vs 5.3% in 3Q16) for larger budget in 4Q17. Overall, non-GAAP
        operating margin and net margin trended down by 1.5ppts and 1.3ppts YoY to 4.6% and 3.7% in 3Q17, respectively,
        below our expectation of 4.4% and 3.8%. Net operating cash and capex for the 12 months ended Sep 2017 was
        RMB905m and RMB2.7bn, respectively.</p>
