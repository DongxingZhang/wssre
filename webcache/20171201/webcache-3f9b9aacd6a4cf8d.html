    <p> Buy Amplats, Sell Lonmin; 2018 likely another year of marginal cost pricing.<br/><br/>
        We update our Rand basket prices in this note by an average of 16% over the nextthree years owing to changing
        our Rand exchange rate inputs to a blended 30-and 90-day trailing average. However, we make no changes to
        recommendations:our methodology of setting the price at the 90th percentile of the cost curve (givenour view
        that we are in a balanced market) is unchanged. We highlight the majorevents to track in 2018 including: 1) the
        advancement of key projects, 2) progressof strategic reviews, 3) distortions in cash flows from significant
        inventory flows,and 4) several pending M&amp;A; transactions. Amplats (Buy, R420ps) is best suitedto cope in
        this environment. It features favourably on the lower end of the costcurve and 50% of its business is earning a
        processing/marketing margin on otherproducers' concentrate. Lonmin (Sell, R4.90/GBp27ps) is in a precarious
        positionas the marginal producer in a low price environment. It has delayed its FY17results as it looks to
        conclude its operational review before conducting a year-endimpairment test that could see it breach tangible
        net worth banking covenants.<br/><br/>
        Outcome of Lonmin's operational review: going concern implications.<br/><br/>
        Potential outcomes of Lonmin's operational review include sale of downstreamprocessing capacity and/or funding
        partners for life extension and replacementprojects. Lonmin had total liquidity of c.US$450m as at end September
        2017.<br/><br/>
        If banking facilities are withdrawn (Lonmin worst case scenario), it will be leftwith net cash of US$103m - an
        insufficient amount to continue trading withouta capital injection, in our view. However, we would not expect
        this productionto close, given the significant employment it supports, but life extension projectsmay be
        shelved, reducing primary supply in the medium-term.<br/><br/>
        2018 will be a critical year for the delivery of major capital projects.<br/><br/>
        While Lonmin battles to maintain financing and current levels of production,other producers are delivering
        projects important to their business cases in 2018.<br/><br/>
        RBPlat's Styldrift is targeting 150ktpm by the end of CY2018 (Phase 1) whileNortham's Booysendal North deepening
        project is targeting completion in June2018. Also key to the outlook for the operations of the SA PGM producers
        arepending transactions including the sale of Union mine (Amplats sale), Tumelaresources (Amplats sale to
        Northam), the Maseve plant (RBP purchase) and theEland platinum acquisition (Northam purchase). RBPlat has
        indicated it will likelybe coming to the market for up to R1bn in equity to fund its acquisition of theMaseve
        plant to ease processing constraints on the Styldrift ramp-up.</p>
