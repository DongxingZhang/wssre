        TCCI to be delisted on November 20. TCCI (1136.HK) announced that theCompany will be delisted from the HKEx on
        November 20, which suggests theprivatization plan is close to completion. As SINOMA (1893.HK) will be mergedwith
        CNBM soon, there are a limited number of potential M&amp;A; targets on themain board. Currently, Asia Cement
        (0743.HK) is still trading at a very lowvaluation of 0.37x PBR. Meanwhile, West China Cement (2233.HK) may
        notlook very cheap at 0.86x PBR, but since the current price of HK$1.18 is still farbelow the previous offer
        price of HK$1.69 from Conch Cement (0914.HK), webelieve investors will continue monitor the Company
        closely.<br/><br/>
