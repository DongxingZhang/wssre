    <p> Overall auto demand to stay mild but NEV demand to surge.<br/><br/>
        We spent most of last week in China visiting passenger vehicle (PV) OEMs,dealers, auto-related internet
        companies and industry experts. In general, theseentities feel that China's new PV demand growth will stay mild
        in 2018 while newenergy vehicle (NEV) demand will surge with the government push. That said,we can feel the
        incremental cost pressure at OEMs to be compliant with futurefuel economy and NEV credit standards, not to
        mention the heat from increasedcompetition in the NEV space with more new OEMs and lower subsidies. We thinkthat
        such an environment may be negative for SUV-oriented companies such asGreat Wall Motor.<br/><br/>
        Incremental income opportunities for auto financing and used car sales.<br/><br/>
        On the positive side, we observe incremental income opportunities for theauto industry in the area of auto
        financing/leasing and used car sales, drivenby the still-small used-car market size and low auto finance
        penetration inChina vs. the global norm. Its vast market opportunities also attract theparticipation of more
        entities such as internet companies, with their emphasison service and convenience to users, especially the
        younger generation. Wethink the development of the auto financing business will benefit companies likeZhengtong
        and companies like Autohome will also benefit from new businessinitiatives in used cars and big data services.
