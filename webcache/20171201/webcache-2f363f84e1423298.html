    <p> According to the home price index for 70 large and medium-sized cities in China released by theNational Bureau
        of Statistics, new home prices recorded a 30th consecutive MoM increase inOctober 2017. Meanwhile, second-hand
        home prices in the 70 cities rose for the 31st consecutivemonth. We believe property tightening policies are
        unlikely to ease before the National People'sCongress and the Chinese People¡¯s Political Consultative Conference
        in March 2018, and do notexpect property regulation to loosen substantially in 2018. We remain Underweight the
        sector.<br/><br/>
        Home prices. Looking at 15 core cities with a regulated real estate market, we note new homeprices remained
        stable in October 2017, after declining on a MoM basis in August and September.<br/><br/>
        The number of cities with declining new home prices decreased to eight in October (vs 12 in Augustand 10 in
        September), while Chengdu, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Tianjin recorded a MoM increase inOctober 2017. Meanwhile, the
        second-hand home market reported weaker prices than the newhome market, prices decreasing for three consecutive
        months. The number of cities with decliningprices increased to 10 in October (vs eight in August and September).
        We note second-hand homeprices in Chengdu, Wuhan, and Hangzhou increased MoM for the past two years, while MoM
        pricechanges turned positive in Shanghai and Shenzhen in October 2017, after declining for severalmonths.
        Looking at lower-tier cities, we note the change in new home prices also outperformedthat in second-hand home
        prices, new home prices recording a 24th consecutive MoM increase inOctober 2017 (+0.34%; vs 0.27% in
        September), while the MoM increase in second-hand homeprices narrowed for the fourth consecutive month (+0.21%
        in October).<br/><br/>
        Home sales. China¡¯s new home sales volume rose 5.6% YoY in January-October 2017, but dropped8.6% YoY in October
        2017 (vs -5.7% YoY in September, when it first turned negative after 20consecutive months of YoY increase). More
        specifically, new home sales volume in 40 core citiesfell 7% YoY in January-October (35% of nationwide sales),
        with double-digit monthly YoY declinesfor several months, while new home sales volume in lower-tier cities rose
        14% YoY (65% ofnationwide sales), with monthly growth decelerating from double-digit YoY increase to flat YoY
        inSeptember and turning to single-digit YoY decline in October. We note the YoY decline in newhome sales in
        several cities, including Beijing, started to narrow in the first half of November,mainly due to a low base
        effect (weak sales in November 2016 due to tightening regulation).<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, media reported that Nanjing buyers are queuing up at night to buy homes, implyingresilient demand
        amid strict controls on home price caps in core tier-1 and tier-2 cities.<br/><br/>
        New home supply. The aggregate floor area of new construction starts rose 5.6% YoY over thefirst ten months,
        with monthly YoY growth turning negative to -4.3% YoY in October, afterdecelerating for several months. The
        monthly YoY growth in 40 core cities decelerated to singledigitgrowth since 3Q16 and turned negative to -9% YoY
        in 3Q17, leading to +3% YoY in 9M17 (vs+13% YoY in 2016). However, the monthly YoY growth in lower-tier cities
        started to accelerate in4Q16 (+22% YoY in 4Q16; +24% YoY in 1Q17; +14% YoY in 2Q17; +14% YoY in 3Q17), leading
        to+16% YoY in 9M17 (vs +6% YoY in 2016). Assuming normal development pace, we expect newhome supply to
        experience a peak over the next four consecutive quarters, starting in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        Government policy. During China¡¯s 19th National Congress, policymakers stressed the importanceto curb home
        speculation, expanding restrictions on home sales to lower-tier cities. Moreover,mortgage loans remain under
        strict control with rising rates (the premium of loan rates overbenchmark interest rates was increased to 5-10%
        for first-home buyers and 15-20% for secondhomebuyers). Meanwhile, consumption loans are undergoing tightening
        regulation, and theNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) recently conducted cross-provincialchecks
        on non-standard pricing and unfair lottery, while banks are required by the China BankingRegulatory Commission
        (CBRC) to carry out stress tests to scale down credit granted to highlyleveraged developers. Given the strict
        regulations in the real estate industry and the significantincrease in home supply in the next four quarters
        (especially in lower-tier cities), we expect achange in supply-demand dynamics. Whether mortgage loan control
        will be eased in 1Q18 wouldbe a key factor determining a turning point in home prices. We already note a number
        of signals,including weak second-hand home prices and a significant drop in premium rates in the landmarket. We
        remain Underweight the sector and recommend investors avoid highly leverageddevelopers, such as Sunac China
        Holdings (1918:HK ¨C SELL) and Guangzhou R&amp;F; Properties(2777:HK ¨C Underperform).</p>
