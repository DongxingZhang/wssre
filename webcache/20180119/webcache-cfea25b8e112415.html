    <p> Imported OCC contaminant threshold fixed at strict levels of 0.5%<br/><br/>
        On January 11, 2018the Ministry of Environment Protection (MEP) releasedthe "Environmental protection control
        standard for imported solid wastes asraw materials¡ªWaste and scrap of paper or paperboard (GB16487.4-
        2017)",effective from March 1this year. Ignoring protests by WTO, China has fixedthe OCC contaminant cap at an
        extremely strict level of 0.5% versus 1.5%in the previous regulation, published in 2005(GB16487.4- 2005). This
        meansthe impurities included in the OCC (i.e. waste wood chips, glass, plastics,rubber, metals, paints) cannot
        exceed 0.5%. The final contaminant requirementis unchanged from the version submitted by China government to WTO
        onNovember 16, 2017, which attracted many protests from global recyclingcommunities as they have to invest
        considerable sums to upgrade their collectionand sorting facilities. Accordingly, we expect recycling/sorting
        costs to riseworldwide with US recyclers most affected since they are the largest supplierto China, accounting
        for 46% of waste paper shipped into China in 2016. Basedon the current standard, US#11waste paper shipped into
        China has a 1.0%contaminant standard, which would force China to buy more expensive US#12or US#13OCC, not to
        mention the lack of supply globally. The most immediateoutcomes are as follows. 1) OCC #11prices will plummet,
        benefiting global millswhile Chinese mills will suffer from higher OCC prices through grade upgrading.2) Margins
        will be squeezed for China mills since imports of finished paper willcontinue to flood China, with the global
        cost curve being lowered as they canuse cheaper US#11OCC. China still has the highest paper prices in the world,
        soraising domestic paper prices to pass through higher OCC costs will be difficult.3) Large players' advantage
        to import cheap waste paper overseas will dissipate,putting them on equal footing with small mills, which
        primarily use domesticpaper. This new rule clearly benefits box makers as opposed to paper mills.<br/><br/>
        #3batch import quota released<br/><br/>
        On January 12, the MEP released the #3batch of 2018OCC import quota of 466ktto seven large paper mills,
        including Shenyang/Hebei/Quanzhou plants of NDPand Jiangxi plant of LMP. Including the 2.3mt in #1batch and
        344kt in #2batch,China's government has approved 3.1mt of import quota, accounting for 11% oftotal recycled
        paper usage in 2016or 13% excluding unsorted waste paper. On anapples-to-apples basis, the approved import quota
        implied a decline of 82% yoyfrom the first batch last year and would last for two months of production.
        Theincreased frequency of quota release has prevented speculation of waste paperprice. At present, US#11OCC is
        still RMB968, or 37% cheaper than domesticGrade A OCC, which means upcoming cheaper OCC overseas may lead
        domesticOCC prices falling further.<br/><br/>
        Paper mills' margins to stay low or be squeezed further in future<br/><br/>
        According to our spread analysis, the NP/t of China's large paper producers, NDPand LMP, decreased by 3%/8% wow
        to RMB107/t and HKD440/t this week. Atthis level, smaller paper companies are just breaking even or are already
        lossmaking. Most paper mills want to increase paper price but it is proving verydifficult because of sluggish
        demand. With imported OCC entering China at ahigher price but falling paper price, we expect paper mills'
        margins to stay low orsqueeze further in the future. We reiterate Sell rating on NDP with target price
        ofHKD10.98/sh and Hold rating on LMP with target price of HKD8.30/sh.</p>
