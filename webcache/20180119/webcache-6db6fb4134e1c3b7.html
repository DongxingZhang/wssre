    <p> Asia FX is broadly weaker this morning with INR leading losses vs. the USD (0.65%). High oil pricesare hurting
        performance of oil importing countries such as INR, PHP, TRY and supporting oil andcommodity exporters, such as
        RUB, COP and MYR. This morning, Dagong Global, a credit ratingagency based in China, downgraded the US sovereign
        rating from A- to BBB+. The decision couldbe seen as a political statement to US trade officials.<br/><br/>
        Yesterday, in Turkey, the lira weakened 1.2% vs. the USD, and has opened this morning on aweaker tone.
        Geopolitical worries were also a factor behind TRY underperformance. So far thisweek, 1y cross-currency swap
        rates have risen by almost 30bp and the curve is likely to continueto steepen as the market reassesses its
        optimism regarding the inflation outlook in Turkey andbegins to price out rate cuts for 2018. In our view, price
        action in TRY depends heavily on howmuch premium the central bank is willing to provide in order to sustain
        capital inflows. Thelonger-term performance of the TRY, proxied by 12-month realised forward returns in Chart
        1,has generally been in negative territory over the past 5 years. This indicates that local rates inTurkey have
        generally been insufficient to attract sufficient funding from abroad to financeTurkey¡¯s current account
        deficit, putting the lira on a broad depreciation trend.<br/><br/>
        For comparison, in Chart 2, we see that 12-month realised forward returns of the South Africanrand have mostly
        been in positive territory since 2016, after the SARB hiked nominal rates by 75bpin Q1 2016. Given South
        Africa¡¯s relatively lower external funding needs, this was more thansufficient premium to attract investment
        from abroad, which has kept the ZAR on an appreciationtrend. We have discussed this mechanism in more detail in
        our previous publications, such asSouth Africa: Deepening of the easing cycle and CEEMEA: Liquidity squeeze, not
        a funding crisis.</p>
