    <p> Commentary for Tuesday: Eyes are once again on Washington with anotherthreat of government shutdown looming this
        Friday. There are three main pointsof contention: lifting automatic budget caps on government spending,
        resolvingthe status of deferred action protections for undocumented immigrants whoarrived in the US as children
        (the DACA program), and funding of the Children¡¯sHealth Insurance Program (CHIP). On spending, there appears to
        be progresstoward a deal to raise defense and non-defense spending caps for FY 2018by $72billion and $45billion,
        respectively. These sizable increases in budget authoritypresent substantial upside to output growth this year,
        though the timing of whenthat money is actually spent is difficult to project. However, if even half of
        theincreased budget authority is put to work this year, there may be several tenthsupside risk to our current
        2018real GDP growth forecast of 2.3% (Q4/Q4). Indeed,we have already lifted our Q42017real GDP growth projection
        to 3.3% from 2.8%following upward revisions to retail sales last week.</p>
