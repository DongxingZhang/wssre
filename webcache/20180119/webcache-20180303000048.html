    <p> Economic outlook: South Africa¡¯s growth outlook looks set to continue to be challenged bya policy environment
        fraught with uncertainty. The ruling African National Congress is likely,at least initially, to put party unity
        above decisive policy-making, owing to politicalfactionalism and an unwieldy new leadership.<br/><br/>
        Nevertheless, the choice of Cyril Ramaphosa as ANC leader should provide a short-term¡®pop¡¯ to confidence and
        help lift GDP growth slightly in 2018, given the very low bases infixed investment and inventories as well as a
        more stable, resilient consumer.<br/><br/>
        Lower inflation (both headline and core) alongside what should be a less volatile domesticpolitical climate
        should allow the South African Reserve Bank to start thinking about ratecuts again in Q1. Looming credit ratings
        risk following the 21 February national budget andlikely bailouts of state-owned enterprises (particularly
        Eskom) are likely to keep the centralbank cautious, however. The SARB will consider how to ensure that South
        Africa¡¯s real ratesremain favourable in an environment where global monetary tightening looks set to
        continue.<br/><br/>
        Political outlook: There is a growing positive momentum associated with the election of MrRamaphosa and the
        leadership cohort around him to the head of the ANC. We support thesentiment but caution that any assessment of
        the government¡¯s prospects mustacknowledge the difficulty of the task at hand and the many obstacles, subjective
        andobjective.<br/><br/>
        We expect the ANC to continue to characterise itself as a party ¡®of the left¡¯ and it willprobably continue to
        rely on a vigorous and interventionist industrial policy to ameliorategrowing social tensions around the
        racially skewed ownership and control of the SouthAfrican economy and the country¡¯s natural assets.<br/><br/>
        Key themes: This report discusses five key themes for South Africa in 2018: GDP growth;inflation and rates;
        fiscal policy; state-owned enterprises; and politics.</p>
