    <p> The US Treasury released much-awaited list of Russian individuals linked to Putin, markets heave sigh of relief
        as sanctions not extended. The full list is available publicly and includes a number of senior political figures
        close to Putin and few oligarchs with a net worth of USD 1bn or more. However, the US administration has already
        said that these individuals will not face additional sanctions, as being on the list should itself serve as a
        deterrent, sparking a major relief rally in Russian assets. The RUB strengthened to around 55.9 overnight. The
        report on impact of extending sanctions to sovereign debt and financial derivatives is expected on 2
        Feb.<br/><br/>
        We expect the ruble to continue to strengthen this year on strong growth and still high real rates. Correlation
        of the ruble with oil prices has already declined significantly in 2017. Only the limited impact of oil is
        expected this year as well, especially with the implementation of the MinFin¡¯s new budget rule.<br/><br/>
        High-frequency indicators suggest further slowdown in Q4. As per data up to December, 4 out of 5 main sectors of
        the economy have posted slowdown in Q4, when compared to Q3. Industrial production has posted the largest
        slowdown with growth declining from +1.2% YoY on average in Q3, to -1.7% YoY in Q4. Growth in the retail trade,
        on the other hand, has posted an improvement, as household demand is fuelled by rising wage and income growth,
        higher growth in credit to households and stronger consumer confidence. Retail sales growth has improved from
        2.1% YoY on average in Q3 to 3.0% YoY in Q4. On the other hand, decline in the household savings rate has
        stalled as a faster fall in inflation has caused real rates to increase. We now expect real GDP growth to slow
        further in Q4 and thereby take full-year growth to 1.7%. Growth is likely to improve after the Presidential
        elections in March and reach 1.9% for 2018.<br/><br/>
        Headline inflation ended 2017 at historic low of 2.5%; below the 4% target. Annual average inflation thereby
        reached 3.7%, 3.4pps lower than in 2016. The declining trend in food prices seems to have reached a trough, with
        inflation in this sector rising in December for the first time since the harvest-related spike in July. The
        increase in food prices were led mainly by the 3.7pp jump in inflation in fruits and vegetables prices. Core
        inflation, however, continued to decline with both the ROSSTAT and CBR measures reaching historic lows of 2.1%
        YoY and 2.3% YoY respectively.<br/><br/>
        Markets have been concerned about the lack of proper guidance on interest rate path. CBR surprised markets just
        before the year-end, easing by 50bps (DB and market consensus for 25bps easing) and took its key policy rate to
        7.75%. The December meeting made it clear that the CBR was likely to be more data-driven going forward, despite
        its strong hawkish comments. We thus maintain our call for further easing, in 25bps installments, likely skewed
        to H1-2018, as inflation continues to decline. We expect a pause in rate cuts in Q4-2018, as inflation begins to
        converge towards the target from below.<br/><br/>
        The current account posts large surplus in Q4. The CAB jumped from - USD2.5bn in Q3 to USD17.8bn in Q4. Current
        account is typically stronger in Q4. The improvement in Q4-17 was led mainly by higher goods exports, both oil
        and non-oil, and lower services imports. The surplus in the current account was matched by a large net outflow
        in the financial account, led by the banking sector. However, reserve accumulation should continue, despite the
        outflow.</p>
