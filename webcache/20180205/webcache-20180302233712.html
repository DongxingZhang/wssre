    <p> Recurring loss in-line but beat consensus<br/><br/>
        QSLI released preliminary FY17 results with net loss of RMB3.54-4.53bn vs. netprofit of RMB341mn in FY16. The
        lower-than-expected results were attributed to:1) assets impairment write-downs of RMB2.9-3.2bn from chemical
        integrationproject, Haina PVC, Haihong ADC and magnesium integration projects; 2) a lossin the chemical segment
        due to low utilization rate caused by two accidents whichresulted in higher production cost and lower production
        volume. If we excludeimpairments write-downs, recurring profit should be net loss of c.1.37-2.13bn(considering a
        25% tax shield) in FY17, in-line with DBe of net loss of RMB2.1bnon low end, but beat consensus estimates of net
        loss of RMB2.56 by 17%.<br/><br/>
        Mixed performance<br/><br/>
        Potash: according to our calculations, QSLI potash sales volume dropped5% YoY in FY17 to 4.65mntons, indicating
        the 2H17 sales volumerebounded back since the 1H17 registered 25% YoY sales volume decline.<br/><br/>
        Chemical: 1) high DD&amp;A; charge on magnesium integration and HainaPVC projects starting operations; 2) lower
        overall utilization rate attributedto a) two accidents in Haina and chemical subsidiaries; b)
        continuousenvironmental scrutiny.<br/><br/>
        Earnings, valuation and risks; maintaining Hold<br/><br/>
        We maintain Hold rating with our DCF-derived TP at RMB11.66 (assuming a 6.6%WACC and 2% terminal growth), which
        implies 1.2x P/B in 17-18E; we believe therisks and rewards are balanced at a current valuation of 1.2x 17E P/B
        vs 1.1% 17EROE, supported by a potentially ROE-/EPS-accretive debt-to-equity swap plan.<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks: 1) sluggish chemical prices and soft demand could lead tolower product sales; and 2)
        unfavorable government policy. Key upside risks: 1)better-than-expected potash prices; and 2)
        faster-than-expected demand growth.</p>
