    <p> Statements will be more important than results.<br/><br/>
        This will be an interesting reporting season. A quarter that traditionally seeswrite-downs, cost true-ups and
        downstream weakness results will, wesuspect, be at the lower end of market expectations. Disconcerting perhaps
        fora sector that has run hard on the back of an escalating oil price. Absolutely keyto our minds, however, will
        be messaging on how management intendsallocating the excess cash that the businesses should now start to
        generate.<br/><br/>
        OK, it's early; companies will layer the commentary with caution. Yet, with FCFcover of dividends running at
        c1.3x DB deck ($62/bbl) and 1.5x at spotshareholders should expect to benefit. Weakness is an entry opportunity.<br/><br/>
        Statements on allocation will be key.<br/><br/>
        No doubt it¡¯s easy to be carried away by the potential implications of thestrong recovery in the oil price for
        sector companies. After three years of hardwork we are, however, at that point in the companies¡¯ cash flow
        cycles when ¨Cbe it $70/bbl or $50/bbl - the mindset should be shifting from ¡®how do Ibalance the shortfall¡¯ to
        ¡®how do I allocate the excess¡¯. With this in mind ouradmittedly overly simplified view suggests that management
        statements onintent will likely prove more important than the actual reported numbers.<br/><br/>
        The quarter? Prefer gas, uncertain downstream.<br/><br/>
        Moving back to reporting our expectation is clearly that, akin to last year, thisis a quarter where cost true up
        and seasonal downstream weakness will dolittle to support reported results. If we are forced to distinguish
        based onmarket trends our bias would be to prefer gas exposure (Statoil, Shell) but becautious downstream (GALP,
        Repsol). If we look to the potential for positivestatements on prioritization of shareholder for cash return
        and, taking intoaccount management ethos, BP, Total and Repsol stand out (see Figs 1 &amp; 2).</p>
