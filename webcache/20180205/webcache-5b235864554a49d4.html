    <p> 2017 net profit up 78%-88%, but trailing the expectation of ~100% growth¡­<br/><br/>
        Sunway released 2017 result preview and expects net profit to reachRMB950mn to RMB1bn (up 79% YoY to 88% YoY).
        Despite being a stellarresult, this figure missed DBe/market expectation (of 100% growth) by ~10%.<br/><br/>
        ¡­due to order/ASP cuts from some clients, forex, finance costs and others<br/><br/>
        Sunway attribute the miss to 1) order cuts and ASP erosion from some clients(we expect to Oppo, Vivo and
        tier-two Chinese OEMs) leading to slower toplinegrowth and margin decline in 4Q17, 2) the surge in forex loss
        (due to RMBappreciation against USD), and interest expense (to finance the Changzhouplants), and 3) RMB100mn+
        YoY increase in opex (due to aggressive businessexpansion). Our prior Sunway earnings model had properly
        factored in theincrease in opex (the third factor), but we underestimated the negative impactsfrom first two
        factors.<br/><br/>
        Positive long-term outlook unchanged<br/><br/>
        We remain positive on Sunway, as the progress of winning multiple iPhonecomponent projects stays on track,
        including 1) Lightning connectors (as the3rd supplier in 2018), 2) VCM cases, and dual cam supporting frame (as
        the keysupplier), and 3) market share gains in EMI shielding cases. Also, it could likelygain share in Samsung¡¯s
        wireless charging module in 2018 too.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        We trim 2017/18/19 EPS forecasts by 10%/4%/4% to price in 4Q17 non-op lossand softer outlook for Chinese
        clients, and trim TP from RMB52 to RMB50. Ournew TP is still based on 33.5x 2018 PER, or 0.8x PEG (in line with
        regionalpeers). Risks: market share loss, slow spec upgrade, and iPhone weakness.</p>
