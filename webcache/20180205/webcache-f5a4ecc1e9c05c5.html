    <p> A market for selective players; Buy GCL-Poly.<br/><br/>
        Rapid capacity expansion despite stable demand will create price pressuresahead, which is to be expected for a
        subsidized industry in which pricereduction is the key to long-term success. Low-cost, high-efficiency
        producersshould consolidate their leadership and GCL-Poly is well placed to achieve this.<br/><br/>
        Almost fully converted to diamond wire cutting and with cheaper in-house polysupply, it has a &gt;15% cost
        advantage over peers, driving a 13% earningsCAGR. Trading on 0.8x PB and a PE of just 7x, the shares are at a
        substantialdiscount to its closest peer, Longi (4.6x PB and 13x PE). We raise our forecastsby 14-25% and our TP
        to HK$1.70. Buy.<br/><br/>
        Demand: stable and resilient after a strong spike in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Global solar installation jumped +36% to 105GW in 2017 and we expect solardemand to stay resilient and grow a
        mild 2% to 107GW in 2018. We staypositive on China¡¯s solar capacity outlook and expect 50GW installation in2018
        (only a mild retreat yoy), supported by rising distributed PV, povertyalleviation projects, and rush
        installation ahead of a tariff cut in 2019. Throughto 2020, we forecast a global demand CAGR of 9%, driven by
        growth in Indiaand other emerging markets, as well as a recovery in the US/EU. Demand alsolooks healthy in the
        longer term after reaching grid parity in more countries.<br/><br/>
        Supply: more new capacity addition leads to consolidation opportunities.<br/><br/>
        We forecast c.20% wafer oversupply this year due to accelerated capacityexpansion (+15%/27% in 17/18). This will
        be driven by both Mono-Si players(+&gt;80%) and an additional 20% from Multi-si players converting to
        diamondwire cutting. Conversely, poly supply should remain tight until 3Q18, given thatnew capacity ramp-ups are
        mainly scheduled for later in the year. In anoversupplied wafer market, price dynamics will squeeze small-scale
        playersand those multi-si producers using high-cost slurry wire cutting. We expectwafer prices to continue to
        drop in 2018/19 (-11% p.a.). This should ultimatelyforce out inefficient producers, with a larger market share
        taken by the lowproduction-cost leaders.<br/><br/>
        GCL-Poly stands out as cost leader; lifting earnings forecasts.<br/><br/>
        Multi-Si players, by upgrading to diamond wire cutting, blacksilicon and PERC,have largely caught up with
        mono-Si competitors in terms of cost reductionand efficiency improvement. After adopting diamond wire conversion
        andexpanding in-house poly supply, GCL-Poly is further cementing its leadershipas a low-cost multi-Si wafer
        producer. We expect its total wafer cost to drop11% and market share to rise 3ppt to 24% in 2018. We lift our
        2017-19Eearnings forecasts by 14-25% on higher wafer shipment and faster cost cuts.<br/><br/>
        An earnings CAGR of 13% in 17-19E is mainly driven by wafer output, whilewe expect blended wafer margin to be
        stable with cost reductions largelyoffsetting falling ASP. Also, GCL is undergoing a deleveraging process.</p>
