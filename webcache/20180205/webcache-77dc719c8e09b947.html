    <p> Negative profit warnings, largely due to bad debt provision on Gionee¡¯s A/R<br/><br/>
        In our Jan 17 industry report (titled Gionee woes, likely more to come; weprefer iPhone to China supply chain),
        we highlighted Gionee¡¯s cash flow issueand how O Film could take the hardest hit among companies under
        ourcoverage. Our concern has come true. O-Film just issued a negative profit alert,cutting 2017 net profit
        guidance by 22%-26%. For 2018, O-Film highlights thatthey will gain market shares in China¡¯s dual cam market and
        more newprojects from Apple (touch sensor and Face ID¡¯s RX module). We remainconcerned that there could be more
        bad debt provision in 2018, as O-Film hasrelatively higher exposure to China¡¯s tier-two brands; maintaining
        Hold.<br/><br/>
        More details about profit alert and the bad debt provision<br/><br/>
        O-Film is reducing its 2017 net profit guidance from ¡°RMB129m to RMB158m¡±to ¡°RMB100m to RMB115m¡±, and attributes
        the miss to a non-cash bad debtprovision of RMB300m. O-Film highlights that the total outstanding A/R fromGionee
        is about RMB600m. Gionee is still in operation, despite facing cashflow issues. As a result, O-Film believes
        that a RMB300m provision should beenough to cover the risk. Aside from the bad debt, we believe Q-Film¡¯s
        4Q17results were also negatively impacted by order cuts from Oppo and Vivo.<br/><br/>
        Other business updates<br/><br/>
        Other key highlights in the analyst call included: 1) for Apple business, O-Filmexpects to become the back-up
        supplier for iPhone¡¯s ITO touch sensor and RXmodule in iPhone¡¯s Face ID system in 2H18; 2) for dual cam, O-Film
        expectsgrow its shipments from sub-50m in 2017 to 100m+ in 2018, driven by marketshare gain in China¡¯s tier-one
        OEMs ¨C particularly, O-Film expects to becomethe largest dual-cam supplier for Huawei¡¯s high-end phones (P/Mate
        series)and 3) ASP of dual cams could rise from RMB100-RMB110 in 2017 to RMB120in 2018, due to better product mix
        (with gross margin of ~18%).<br/><br/>
        Valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        We cut 2017/18/19 EPS ests by 27%/24%/11% (to reflect bad debt provision andOppo/Vivo weakness) and reduce our
        TP from RMB23 to RMB17.5, still based on26x 2018E EPS or 0.8x PEG (2017-20E EPS CAGR of 33%). 0.8x PEG is in
        linewith regional tech peer avg. Upside risks include: 1) faster than expected takeoffof fingerprint sensor
        business; 2) stronger than expected smartphone cameraupgrade trend. Downside risks include: 1) fiercer than
        expected pricecompetition in touch panel sector; 2) more significant margin erosion in handsetcamera sector
        stemming from smartphone consolidation trend.</p>
