    <p> CU to benefit the most from new tower contracts.<br/><br/>
        We believe the new TowerCo rental agreement is a net positive for the telecomoperators, as the lower rental
        would boost their cash flow generation andcould pave the way for the TowerCo to start the listing process in the
        comingmonths. While the TowerCo¡¯s profitability may be impacted, this may be offsetby a longer depreciation
        period and a greater focus on cost efficiency, whichhas been somewhat deficient so far. CU benefits the most
        from the rentalreduction, given the higher operating leverage - we estimate a 1.6% lift to CU'sEBITDA from lower
        rentals.<br/><br/>
        Tower rental to reduce by 6-8%.<br/><br/>
        The operators were able to negotiate lower tower rental for existing and newtowers from 1 Jan 2018, by
        increasing the discount rate offered to multitenancytowers (by 10%) and reducing the mark-up (from 15% to 10%).
        For CTand CU, we estimate that the new contract would reduce their tower rentalcosts by ~8% while for CM, the
        reduction is slightly less at 6%, due to a lowerco-sharing ratio. On average, the lower tower rental should be
        able to liftoperators¡¯ EBITDA by ~1% in FY18.<br/><br/>
        Implications for the TowerCo.<br/><br/>
        The implications for the TowerCo are prima facie negative, as we estimate thelower rental income would reduce
        its FY18 net profit by RMB3.8bn. However,there are avenues to claw back the lost profits: we estimate that if
        theTowerCo is able to reduce opex by 5%, increase the depreciation period by 1year and earn an extra 1% revenue
        (e.g. via other avenues such as electric carcharging stations), this would mostly offset the impact. By giving
        away a lowergross margin on the tower rental, the operators may have spurred theTowerCo into action on business
        development and efficiency drive.<br/><br/>
        Earnings and valuation unchanged for the time being.<br/><br/>
        We leave our earnings and valuations unchanged for the time being, given thenew rental agreement does not impact
        on FY17 profit and there is stilluncertainty around TowerCo¡¯s profitability (as per above). We currently
        valuethe TowerCo equity at RMB230bn but apply a 30% discount when including itin the operators¡¯ valuation, to
        allow for uncertainty in its value and a holdingcompany discount.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        We base our sector valuation generally on a DCF approach, which we applydue to the relatively predictable cash
        flow profiles of Chinese telcos. We use a7.5% WACC for China Telecom and China Mobile, and an 8.4% WACC forChina
        Unicom. We use 0-0.5% perpetual growth rates to reflect populationgrowth. Upside risk: cost cuts. Downside risk:
        lower ARPU from competition.</p>
