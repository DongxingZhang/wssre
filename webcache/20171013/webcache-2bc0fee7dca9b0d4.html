        Into the second year of China¡¯s 13th five-year period, the country¡¯s environmentalprotection &amp; clean energy
        sector continues on an uptrend in total investment.More water and waste treatment projects are entering the
        execution stageunder public-private partnership (PPP), with PPP funds increasingly popular asa financing
        channel. Solar capacity additions reached a new high at 24GW in1H17, and grid curtailment reduction was on track
        in both wind and solar;<br/><br/>
        the growth of natural gas consumption has also recovered to a mid-teen level.Nevertheless, challenges exist,
        such as the uncertainty related to intensifyingproject competition, potential risks related to an overheating
        PPP market, anda widening renewable subsidy funding gap. Meanwhile, against the backdropof an improving macro
        economy, it is critical to convey the right messages toinstitutional investors, which tend to view environmental
        and clean energy asstructural plays rather than cyclical beneficiaries.¡£</p>
