    <p> Published in Am. Soc. for Microbiol. on 5 Sept 17, medical researchers from theUniversity of Hong Kong described
        their discovery of a chemical drug being both aninhibitor and a non-antibiotics to treat multi-drug resistant
        bacteria such as MRSA(Methicillin-resistant Staphylocossus aureus). This inhibitor called NP16 targets tothe
        bacteria¡¯s (Staphylocossus aureus) enzyme, whereby the drug disarms it sothat they cannot cause diseases to
        human. NP16 acts on the bacterial enzymeknown as dehydrosqualene desaturase (CrtN), which reduces its
        pigmentproduction that is responsible to bacteria¡¯s ability against our immune systemdefense (like neutrophil or
        phagocytic cell action).<br/><br/>
        According to the Standard, the HK researchers had screened over 50,000structurally diverse small chemical
        molecules. It was likely that only NP16 shows itsstrong inhibitory effect to the bacteria¡¯s pigment production
        that resists our bodydefensive action.<br/><br/>
        Note that, MRSA is resistant to many commonly-used antibiotics, includingpenicillin, cephalosporin and
        methicillin.<br/><br/>
        We reckon that, this development will help (1) increase the importance of R&amp;Dexpenses; to sales for many HK
        and China drug-makers; (2) recognize the strong tiebetween academia and commercial drug-makers; (3) seek the
        alternatives forover-use antibiotics on MRSA, a superbug in many countries.<br/><br/>
        With reference to S.M. Opal cited in Crit Care, there are at least six types of nonantibioticstreatment for
        bacterial infection. This includes (1) Hemoperfusiondevices (reducing bacteria¡¯s concentration in blood using
        filters); (2) Quorumsensing inhibitors (disrupting bacterial cell signaling for gene synthesis); (3)
        Lyticbacteriophage (using parasitic predators as bactericidal agents); (4) Polyclonal ormonoclonal antibodies as
        immunity assistance (eg marking pathogen for ourimmune system to ingest and eliminate); (5) Liposome-based
        cytotoxin inhibitors(engineered liposome as membrane decoys to absorb bacterial toxin); and (6)
        Nonimmunetoleralizing approaches (permitting our body to tolerate the pathogenuntil our immune or related system
        to clear the bacteria).<br/><br/>
        Stock impact: As NP16 is a simple heterocyclic organic compound as well asbeing a small chemical molecule, many
        local drug-makers are able to produce it invast quantity for supply, once all the clinical trials and patent
        issues have beensorted. We see at least two HK-listed drug-makers would likely have the potentialto go into this
        field, namely (1) Jacobson Pharm (2633.HK, BUY, TP:HK2.30) for itsHK top-brand generic drug-maker to HK
        hospitals; and (2) The United Lab(3933.HK, BUY, TP:HKD9.60) for its years of China expertise in vertically
        integratedantibiotics production with HK presence. Other HK listed China drug-makers, wereckon, that would show
        some interests in this area are (1) Livzon Pharm (1513.HK,BUY, TP:HKD51.90) on its long-time reputation in bulk
        medicine and finished drugsfor antibiotics such as cephalosporin; (2) CSPC Pharm (1093.HK, NR) on its beingChina
        leading bulk drugs supplier of antibiotics with this sales over HKD1.3bn in2016; (3) HEC Pharm (1558.HK, NR) on
        its leading drug-maker for generic versionof Tamiflu, Kewei (a potent anti-viral drugs for influenza).</p>
