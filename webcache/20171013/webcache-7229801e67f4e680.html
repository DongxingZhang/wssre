    <p> Lowest leverage: of 4x in 1H17 (peers: 9x). The company¡¯s assets grew at a more manageable pace, with an 11%
        CAGR in assets (peers: +20%) while its equity grew 19% from 2013-1H17 (peers: +22%). ¡£<br/><br/>
        Improved funding structure: While BoCA¡¯s cost of funds has been steadily increasing, to 2.8% in 1H17 (2013-16:
        average 2.1%) from higher % in fixed debt (45% vs. 14% in FY13), higher % in unsecured funding to 73%, this
        should help BoCA in minimizing the revenue mismatch (60% fixed rate). The funding structure improvement has
        prompted S&amp;P; to upgrade BoCA¡¯s notes under the MTM program to A- (from BBB+) in Jun¡¯17. ¡£<br/><br/>
        Strong fundamentals: BoCA still has the highest RoA vs. peers at ann. 3.45% (peers: 1.05%), a consistent net
        lease yield of 8-8.5%, avg profit growth of 15% in the past three full years, a high fleet utilization rate
        (~100%) and a long committed lease term (8 years). Overall, we see little impairment, as its planes still carry
        a 13% fair value premium over BVs. ¡£</p>
