    <p> The People¡¯s Bank of China (PBoC) ordered a targeted required reserves ratio (RRR) cut of 50bpsfor commercial
        banks with 1.5%-plus of loans' exposure to small businesses or agricultural loans,although as RRR cut applies to
        the PBoC¡¯s benchmark RRR rather than an individual bank¡¯scurrent RRR, reducing the benefit to banks that have
        already been recipients of earlier targetedRRR cuts. We calculate that CITIC is the Hong Kong-listed bank that
        stands to benefit most fromthe recent policy, with an RRR cut of up to 150bps. We maintain our EPS forecast at
        Rmb0.89 in17E (+5% YoY) but lift our forecasts from Rmb0.96 to Rmb0.97 in 18E (+9% YoY) and fromRmb1.06 to
        Rmb1.07 in 19E (+10% YoY). We raise our target price from HK$5.99 to HK$6.09.<br/><br/>

        Fundamental improvements. As of end-1H17, small loans accounted for 15% of CITIC¡¯s totalloans, making it highly
        likely CITIC will be eligible for a 150bps RRR cut from 2018. According toour calculations, this will release
        Rmb60bn in liquidity for the firm to offer as credit or to invest infixed income, which could, in turn, enhance
        its net interest margin (NIM) by 2bps and net profitby 1%. More importantly, we view the targeted RRR cut as a
        signal that the latest monetary policycycle may be ready to loosen again and we see potential for gradual
        improvement in interbankliquidity in coming months. As a lender with a relatively high degree of interbank
        marketliabilities, CITIC may be one of the biggest beneficiaries of loosening.<br/><br/>
        Valuation recovery. Looking forward into 4Q17, we see banks as likely to report relative returnsas valuations
        may recover as monetary policy eases. Increasingly tight loans quota andstrengthening property regulations
        drives the cost of financing for the real economy higher,resulting in downward pressure on property sales and
        property investment as well as relatedmanufacturing investment and consumption growth in 4Q17. Disappointing
        property sales in thepeak seasons of September and October would raise market concerns over economic growth,
        anda subsequent policy loosening in reaction would benefit banking sector valuations. As the lenderwith the
        weakest valuation at present and the largest valuation discount, we see CITIC as likely topost a substantial
        improvement. CITIC stock has gained only 9% YTD, as compared to a sectoraverage rally of 23% and a rally in the
        HSCEI of 21%. Currently it is only trading at 0.5x 17E PB, ascompared to a sector average of 0.7x. CITIC¡¯s
        H-shares trade at a discount of 33% to its A-shares,(sector average: 19%). The deviation of the firm¡¯s PB
        valuation as implied by the sector averageratio of PB to ROE is currently 0.89x, vs its historical average
        deviation of 0.96x.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Outperform. We maintain EPS forecast at Rmb0.89 in 17E (+5% YoY) and revise up ourforecasts from
        Rmb0.96 to Rmb0.97 in 18E (+9% YoY) and from Rmb1.06 to Rmb1.07 in 19E (+10%YoY). We roll over our 0.6x target
        PB multiple to our 18E forecast and revise up our target pricefrom HK$5.99 to HK$6.09. With 18% upside, we
        maintain our Outperform rating.</p>
