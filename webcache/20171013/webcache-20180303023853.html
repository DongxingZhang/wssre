    <p> US equities' price-to-book premium over European stocks is close to a 20-yearhigh, at around 70%. Yet, even
        before the recent re-rating, US stocks have enjoyeda consistent valuation advantage, with the average
        price-to-book premium overEurope at almost 50% over the past two decades. We highlight the main driversof the
        US' persistent valuation advantage: a superior return on equity (due tohigher margins) and a lower cost of
        equity (a function of USD-denomination,lower volatility and the US' more favourable tax regime). We also look at
        theprospects for the valuation premium to normalize over the coming years.</p>
