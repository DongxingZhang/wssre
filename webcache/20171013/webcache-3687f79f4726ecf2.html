    <p> Genuine corporate governance change in Japan would be a major event forinvestors. Japan has a long road to
        travel to reach global standards. The goodnews is that Japan has begun the journey, and total pay-out ratios
        have risen toaround 50%. The bad news is that progress is hard to identify in the corporateefficiency metrics of
