    <p> This report provides a weekly update on upcoming issuances in EMEA local bond markets. While we provide details
        on issuances, we also evaluate the attractiveness of bonds on auction based on our DB valuation models. In
        addition, we incorporate a cross-country analysis on local bonds, summarizing recent auctions as well as
        explaining the issuance mix/strategy for each country. The report will develop over time, and we are planning to
        incorporate more EM(EA) countries within the next publications. For now we cover the following countries: Czech,
        Hungary, Israel, Poland, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.</p>
