    <p> 3Q operating profit to meet forecasts: Our estimates have the 3Q consolidatedsales and operating profit of
        Hyundai Green Food (HGF) up a respective 3.5% and15.9% y-y to KRW641.7b and KRW31b, with the latter to meet the
        consensus. All-roundearnings improvement during the quarter are likely being led by: 1) dissipation of
        baseeffect at its catering division; 2) the addition of catering/restaurant clients and meatdistribution sales
        rebounds by the food-material distribution division; 3) a new Garden5store run by the retail [B2C] division; and
        4) overseas order growth and an increasedportion of high-margin fire truck sales by subsidiary
        Everdigm.¡£<br/><br/>
        Core operation turnaround bodes well: HGF¡¯s core catering operation is on therebound after seeing respective
        sales contractions of 12.5% and 4.9% y-y in 1Q and 2Q,which owed to: 1) captive clients Hyundai Heavy Industries
        [HHI] and Hyundai Motorshaving reduced working hours since May 2016and endured a labor strike, respectively;and
        3) fewer business days since May had four weekday holidays. We expect such sales torise 5.6% y-y this quarter,
        however, on: 1) dissipation of base effect related to HHI; 2)positives from recent ASP hikes; and 3) more
        business days since Chuseok is nextmonth¡ªvs Sep 2016. Even though the holiday falls in 4Q this year, sales drops
        should beoffset by additional ASP hikes.¡£</p>
