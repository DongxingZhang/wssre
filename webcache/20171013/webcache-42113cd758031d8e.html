    <p> Strong VIP while mass negatively impacted by typhoons<br/><br/>
        Aug GGR beat the recent market expectation of 18.5% YoY growth. Weestimate Aug GGR in VIP segment to have grown
        33% YoY, and massGGR to record slower growth of 6% YoY on reduced visitor arrivals due totyphoons. Two typhoons
        have hit Macau in late Aug and the MacaoGovernment Tourism Office has suspended package tours to the city
        sinceAug 25in order to free up resources to help the city recover. Therefore, webelieve mass market has taken a
        blow.<br/><br/>
        Full year GGR to grow 17-19% YoY<br/><br/>
        We expect Sep GGR to record slower YoY growth of 18% YoY, given 1)higher base in Sep 2016which recorded 7.4% YoY
        growth in GGR, and 2)impact from suspension of package tours to Macau (to be resumed on Sep2nd). Factoring in
        the impact from two typhoons, we think GGR growth forFY17E should range 17-19% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Buy Galaxy and Sands China<br/><br/>
        The sector is currently trading at 21x FY18E P/E and 13x EV/EBITDA, inlinewith their respective 5-year averages.
        The sector has underperformedHSI in Aug given the market concerns on typhoon¡¯s impact. With the upbeatGGR in
        Aug, we believe that the market will regain confidence on thesector. Currently we suggest investors to
        accumulate Galaxy and SandsChina. We like Galaxy for its continuing strong performance, undemandingvaluation and
        potential in margin expansion. We also like Sands China forits laggard position and high dividend yield in the
        sector.</p>
