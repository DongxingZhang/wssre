    <p> Topics of our conference included of the incidence of diabetes, the growth drivers of insulin and oral
        anti-diabetic drugs(OAD), the treatment on diabetes complications and the comparison on two incretins that
        recently included in NRDL (DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists).<br/><br/>
        1) According to JAMA, the incidence of diabetes among adults above 20 in China was 10.9% (2013: 11.6%). The
        treatment and control rates of diabetes were 32% (flat with the previous survey) and 49% in China (rebounded
        from 2010, showing the efficacy in diabetes treatment).<br/><br/>
        2) Demand drivers in insulin and OAD: The former was driven by demand in lower-tiers cities/rural areas, owing
        to the low treatment rate, increasing penetration, lack of new OADs, etc, while the later was driven by
        mid/large cities, as new patients that emerge from medical examinations are mainly treated by OADs.
        Endocrinology doctors from Huashan Hospital have been training lower-tier cities/rural doctors and conducted
        lifestyle intervention in communities. Among MNCs, Lilly¡¯s Humulin had better penetration in lower tier
        hospitals while Novo Nordisk¡¯s Novolin has lower penetration. Market share of Chinese insulin players was higher
        in rural markets. Pressure from the drug sales ratio cap is still high in endocrinology department.<br/><br/>
        3) Medications for diabetes complications: the highest occurring complications are atherosclerosis (81%),
        hypertension (64%), obesity/overweight (62%), non-alcoholic fatty liver (57%), diabetic nephropathy (33%). Among
        these diabetic nephropathy will be the major cause of China¡¯s ESRD (the end stage renal disease) in future -
        diabetic nephropathy accounted for over 45% of new ESRD cases in developed countries. Given China¡¯s c.30mn
        diabetic nephropathy patients, he estimated that ESRD patients will reach 10mn in 10-15 years, compared to 200k
        dialysis patients now. All these imply a huge market potential in drugs for the prevention/treatment of diabetic
        nephropathy. Medications combined with metformin treatment for atherosclerosis have achieved very good effects,
        and DPP-4 was also found to have CCV benefits. The drugs for diabetic nephropahy are mainly ACEI, IL-1, TCM
        (such as Rhein and Berberine).<br/><br/>
        4) DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1: GLP-1s have better efficacy than DPP-4 - apart from lowering blood glucose
        levels, they can reduce cardiovascular incidents, but their prices are rather high. The long-effect GLP-1
        (Bydureon) has more potential than Byetta and Victoza (once/twice a day injections). DPP-4 inhibitors have been
        included in NRDL recently mainly for affordable prices and ease for use (orally, one tablet per day), which
        should boost sales.</p>
