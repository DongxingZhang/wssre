    <p> In our view, there is a clear and present risk to the earnings turnaround inFY19, as consumption, which has been
        the sole driver of growth, will not likelybe strong enough due to weak fiscal push and job growth (refer to our
        detailedreport on India economics by Upasana ¨C link). The capex cycle remainsnascent and limited to pockets of
        infrastructure.¡£<br/><br/>
        Earnings recovery in FY19should be ~15% vs Street expectations of 21%.Downside to broader market is higher than
        frontline indices due to even moreelevated expectations. Risks can emanate from geopolitical developments,badly
        managed bankruptcies or economic mis-steps in an election year.¡£</p>
