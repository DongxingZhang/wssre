    <p> Petrobras launched cash and exchange offers for up to USD14.4bn ofselect short-dated bonds (¡®19s to ¡®21s). The
        cash offers are exclusive tonon-QIBs and US persons located in the US and capped at USD500mn ifnot waived. The
        exchange offers don¡¯t have a cap and eligible holders whoopt in will receive new ¡®25s and ¡®28s. We view the
        liability managementtransactions as credit positive due to relief to debt amortization profile andmarginal
        reduction in interest rate, despite a 2% increase in net debt dueto tender/exchange premia. If the exchange
        offers are fully subscribed, theportion of Petrobras¡¯ debt coming due by 2021would decline to 40% from53% of
        total debt.¡£<br/><br/>
        We recommend that eligible holders accept the cash and exchange offersdue to positive tender premia at current
        market prices, current tightspreads for the notes being tendered/exchanged on absolute and relativebasis, and
        outsized curve steepness between the exchangeable and newnotes. But be mindful of up to USD13.9bn of new
        7-to-11-year supply ofPetrobras bonds, which can reach up to 26% of all EM non-distressed HYcorporates in this
        maturity bucket, as an important risk.¡£<br/><br/>
        We initiate a trade idea where we prefer PETBRA USD ¡®26s vs. PETBRAUSD ¡®23s, currently at a Z spread
        differential of 100bp, with a target Zspread differential of 80bp, following the excessive underperformance
        ofPETBRA ¡®26s, in our view, after the announcement of the exchange offers.This trade idea is also backed by our
        perception of positive momentum forPetrobras and Brazil for the remainder of the year, with Petrobrasgenerating
        positive cash flow at a Brent price above USD38/bbl, ourexpectation of further positive headline activity
        related to the company¡¯sdivestment program and compensation from the government from the2010capital increase
        adjustments, and Brazil benefitting from a ratingaffirmation by S&amp;P; in August amid a stabilization of the
        politicalenvironment and improvement in macro indicators.¡£<br/><br/>
        In light of this week¡¯s underperformance and current positive relative valueof Petrobras¡¯ 9-and-10-year notes
        (in absolute terms and relative to thePETBRA curve and LatAm corporate peers) and based on our benignoutlook for
        Petrobras and Brazil for the remainder of the year (as well asour constructive stance on EM credit fundamentals
        and neutral view onEM credit spreads), we upgrade Petrobras¡¯ USD notes due 2026and 2017(PETBRA ¡®26s and ¡®27s) to
        Buy from Hold.¡£<br/><br/>
        The key risk factors to our Buy and Hold recommendations on Petrobras,as well as to our curve flattening trade
        idea (PETBRA ¡®26s vs. ¡®23s) and toour recommendations for holders of Old Notes to accept the ExchangeOffers
        include, in our view: 1) positive credit profile and negative bondspread correlation to international oil prices
        and to production trajectory; 2)execution risk on the company¡¯s USD21bn divestment program; 3) sizablenear-term
        debt maturities (USD48-62bn due by 2021depending on theoutcome of the Exchange Offers); 4) Brazil¡¯s fragile
        fiscal situation andpresidential elections in 2018; and 5) general risks for EM credit.¡£</p>
