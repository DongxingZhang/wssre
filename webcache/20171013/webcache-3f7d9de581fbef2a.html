    <p> Sentiment was bullish as 2017E earnings recovery has been confirmed by interim results. Moderate gains should be
        seen in 4Q17 amid bullish estimates. We expect the market to move around 12x12 month forward P/E as further
        surge of earnings estimates is not likely in the short term. Short-term sentiment could be affected as the Fed
        has announced balance sheet normalization to be started in Oct and chance of Dec rate hike increased again. We
        believe there is still downside to the present 12x P/E as potential rebound of DXY and weakening of RMB could
        affect liquidity in HK. With short-term systematic risks in a slow bull market, mid-term visibility and margin
        of safety are particularly important. Margin of safety can be considered on: 1) sustainable earnings growth and
        low Beta, including IT, auto and consumer discretionary counters; and 2) low-valuation blue chips, including
        Chinese banks and insurers. Traditional sectors with high margin of safety such as utilities and telecom are not
        the best choices for now as opportunities in bull markets could be missed due to low volatility. Short-term
        liquidity risks could concentrate on small/mid-caps as investors mainly adopt Buy-and-Hold strategy and allocate
        to blue chips with higher earnings visibility.<br/><br/>
        Aug data missed consensus. 8M17 FAI growth reached 7.8% YoY, 0.5ppt lower than 7M17. Aug industrial added value
        growth was 6.0%, 0.4ppt lower than July due to environmental production restriction. Economy growth could
        moderately decrease amid less government effort on maintaining steady growth, accelerated capacity cut and
        slower property market. M2 growth should slow moderately as structural reforms and deleveraging are still policy
        priorities. Monetary policies among developed economies should converge as growth momentum of Europe and Japan
        is picking up. BoE could raise interest rate next month and ECB could also announce changes in its asset
        purchase programme in Oct. BoJ is cutting its purchase on government bonds under new policy framework.
        Therefore, the initiation of balance sheet normalization by the Fed could hardly strengthen the Dollar, but its
        impact on liquidity in emerging markets needs to be further observed.<br/><br/>
        Based on RSI, telecom, financial and energy sectors weakened last week. Real estate was steady and strong while
        consumer services and raw materials turned weak from strengths. IT grew strong quickly while consumer goods
        manufacturing, industrials, utilities and conglomerates have yet to show clear trends. Capital showed net
        inflows since Sep 1 but diverged in different sectors. Real estate and consumer discretionary had net inflows
        while IT and energy continued to show much net outflows. As for southbound capital, SH-HK Connect began to have
        mild net inflow since Sep (vs net outflow in Aug) while SZ-HK Connect remained steady (c.5% of daily buying
        quota). The percentage of southbound buying on HK stock market turnover also increased.</p>
