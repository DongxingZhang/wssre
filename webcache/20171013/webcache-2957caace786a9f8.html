    <p> RPK growth slowed further: SPA¡¯s revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) growthnormalized to +15.6% YoY in Aug-17,
        from +18.7% in Jul-17. Slowing momentumwas found mainly on domestic routes (+23.5% vs. +28.4%), while growth
        oninternational routes (+1.3% vs. +1.4%) and regional routes (+10.3% vs. +10.0%)remained largely
        stable.<br/><br/>
        In the first eight months of 2017, RPK growth accelerated to +25.6% YoY, from+10.3% in the same period of 2016,
        due to higher capacity input. Specifically,domestic and regional RPKs showed significant rebounds of +37.1% and
        +9.3%,respectively, YoY (vs. -4.3% and -11.8% in the same period of 2016). Due tocapacity pullbacks,
        international RPK growth slowed dramatically to +6.6% YoY,from +57.7% in the same period of 2016.<br/><br/>
        Lower PLFs: Given an +18.1% YoY increase in ASK, SPA¡¯s passenger load factor(PLF) dipped 2.0ppt YoY to 92.6% in
        Aug-17. In particular, as domestic andregional ASK increased by +27.4% and +15.2%, respectively, YoY, PLFs
        dropped to93.1% (-2.9ppt YoY) and 90.6% (-4.0ppt YoY). As international ASK rose +1.8%YoY, PLF dipped slightly
        to 91.7% (-0.4ppt YoY).<br/><br/>
        YTD, overall PLF fell 1.6ppt YoY to 91.7%, with weakness on all routes: domestic(-1.7ppt YoY to 93.4%),
        international (-1.8ppt YoY to 88.3%) and regional (-5.6pptYoY to 88.8%).</p>
