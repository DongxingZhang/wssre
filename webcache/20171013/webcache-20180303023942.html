        Sebastian Raedler: Macro: Flash Euro area composite PMI new orders for Augustremained close to a cyclical peak,
        at 55.7. Yet, PMI momentum ¨C the six-monthchange in PMIs and a key determinant of European equity market
        momentum¨C has fallen from a peak of +3.6points in February to a 10-month low of 0(slide 7). We expect the fade
        in PMI momentum to continue, given that PMIsare still consistent with around 3% Euro area GDP growth,
        significantly aboveour economists¡¯ 2017growth forecast of 2.2% and consensus at 2%. If oureconomists¡¯ growth
        projection materializes (Q3at 0.6%, Q4at 0.5%), this wouldbe consistent with PMIs falling to 53.3by year-end.
        The resulting negativePMI momentum is likely set to weigh on the European equity market over thecoming months.
        European stocks have already fallen by 7% from their May peakas a consequence of a stronger euro, geopolitical
        concerns and fading macromomentum.</p>
