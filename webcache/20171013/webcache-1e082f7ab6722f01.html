    <p> Algo, engagement &amp; op. leverage led to huge earnings beat<br/><br/>
        Top-line beatwas mainly driven by strengthin:1) China commerce retail (57% YoY vs. CMS 48%), driven by new user
        and personalization which led to higher conversion rate and click thru rate, and 2) customer mgt
        revenue(previously called online mktg services), which enjoyed65% YoYgrowthvs. CMS 46%. This concurs with our
        earlier comment that we believe ¡°incremental top-line surprise in FY18E will be coming from Online Marketing
        Services¡±, in our Jul 11 anchor report: Sky is the limit for China¡¯s almighty data commerce giant.On earnings,
        we attribute the huge beat to 1) operating leverage, 2) margin rate, and 3) participation in 618 promotion
        season.<br/><br/>

        BABA ¨Cstill our conviction BUY in Chinainternet/eC space<br/><br/>
        BABA¡¯s growth catalysts: 1) core commerce: accelerated monetization, 2) cloud, and 3) LT capability in unlocking
        value of data/AI. We lift our TP from US$190 to US$220 based on SOTP, implying 35x FY19E non-GAAP earnings. The
        company is trading at 26x FY19E (Mar) P/E or 1.0x FY19E PEG (based on FY20 EPS growth), at discount to FY18E PEG
        of Tencent (700 HK, BUY) 1.6x, Amazon (AMZN US) 2.3x, Baidu (BIDU US) 1.1x, JD (JD US, BUY) 1.1x.</p>
