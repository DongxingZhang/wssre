    <p> A-Share Market Color: Opportunities to remain limited to certain sectors in the absence ofmarket-wide strength;
        stick to earnings-focused stock selection<br/><br/>
        Several fund managers that we talked to believe that we will continue to see a slow bull market in2018and that
        investment opportunities will remain limited to a few certain sectors whereas acrossthe-board share price
        strength is unlikely to be seen. Blue-chip stocks and emerging sectors werementioned by quite a few fund
        managers as preferred investment targets. Many believe that anearnings-focused stock selection strategy will
        remain crucial next year amid such a marketenvironment. In addition, infrastructure investment and other
        economic data are cited by some of thefund managers as key to watch in 1Q18.</p>
