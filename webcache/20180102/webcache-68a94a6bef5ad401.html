        Low or controlled inflation should continue to lend support to (or delay) tightening the monetary policy stance
        of EM central banks. However, this update signals that such support has thinned and the delay has shortened.
        Overall, the closing of the global output gap in 2018 is expected to bring about more inflation to EM.<br/><br/>
        Generalized EM inflation.<br/><br/>
        We update our latent index of underlying global EM inflation, from inflation data in 87 EM countries and
        commodity prices. We show how the measure is useful when compared to simple weighted averages of EM inflation,
        both as a gauge of current pressures and directionality.<br/><br/>
        Composite measures of inflation and inflation expectations.<br/><br/>
        Our EM index of inflation expectations picked up steam again in November, but is still placed halfway relative
        to the heights of Q1 this year. While the nowcast filter helps predict widespread surprises in EM inflation each
        month, our composite heat maps allow for a quick overview of current conditions.<br/><br/>
        EM forecast paths .<br/><br/>
        Our teams around the world now see largely idiosyncratic inflation dynamics in the months ahead. However, the
        general theme is that we see more inflation by end-2018 than at present. The report centralizes all of our views
        on EM inflation for 2018 from our global team of economists.</p>
