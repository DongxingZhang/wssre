    <p> 7 tier-2 cities including Chongqing, Nanchang, Xian, Nanning, Guiyang, Changsha and Shijiazhuang have tightened
        their housing policies over the weekend by raising the minimum holding periods for re-sale from 2 years to 3-5
        years. Our channel checks also suggest that the mortgage rates for first-time home buyers in tier-1 cities
        including Beijing have been raised from PBOC rate to 1.1-1.2x PBOC rate.<br/><br/>
        Such policy tightening measures have come at a negative surprise to the market, and ended any market hopes that
        the peak of tightening cycle has been over. With property inventories remaining at low levels of just 7-11
        months in the top-tiered cities (figures 1-3) and property prices on the rise (figure 5), there is little room
        for the central government to loosen policy in the near-term. We maintain our view that there would not be any
        policy loosening until 3Q18 should housing supply/ property inventory start picking up.<br/><br/>
        Sector is now trading at 8.1x fwd P/E, or 0.5 S.D. above historical average P/E of 7.6x and 8-21% premium to
        previous tightening cycles of 6.7-7.5x P/E in 2011-14. Visible re-rating catalysts look missing in the
        near-term, but more headwinds to follow as we expect more cities (especially tier-2 and major tier-3 cities)
        could follow the path and tighten their housing policies. Investors who look for re-entry should until National
        People¡¯s Congress meeting in October when policy signals become more evident. If any stocks to hold, we prefer
        Vanke for more diversified geographical coverage and Yuzhou on higher earnings visibility.</p>
