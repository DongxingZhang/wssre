    <p> Our views on Chinese pharmas were generally more cautious after the event, noting the higher technical and
        competitive hurdles for the players to overcome. But we think Wuxi Biologics (2269 HK, BUY) will benefit from
        the higher GLP and CMC requirements for Chinese pharma after the ICH entry. We also think Sino Biopharm (1177
        HK, BUY) and CSPC (1093 HK, BUY) will eventually benefit from their competitive edge in generic BE and track
        records in patent challenges.</p>
