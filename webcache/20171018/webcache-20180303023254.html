    <p> FDA provides ways to ease complex generics approvals: FDA has announced anew set of policies aimed at easing
        approvals of complex generic drugs and initiallyissued two draft guidance documents to support the development
        of complex generics.The FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stated in his blog post on 2Oct, 2017that newpolicies
        are aimed to provide as much scientific and regulatory clarity as possible withrespect to complex generics given
        their increasing significance to the economic healthof the generic drug industry. Mr Gottlieb further stated
        that as part of ongoing broaderefforts, the FDA will work to develop more tools, methods, and efficient
        alternativeswherever feasible for reducing hurdles for complex generics and more guidancedocuments should be
        coming in the near-future.¡£<br/><br/>
        What do guidance documents convey? The first draft document reflects a unifiedapproach to all formal meetings
        between FDA and ANDA filers for complex genericsand assists filers in generating and submitting to the FDA a
        meeting request (productdevelopment, pre-submission &amp; mid-review cycle meetings) and the associatedmeeting
        package. These meetings will allow for enhanced communication betweenANDA filers and the FDA early in generic
        development process, thus allowing moreefficient development, review and approval pathways. The second draft
        documentaims to help submissions of ANDAs for certain specific synthetic peptides, referencebrands for which are
        manufactured using rDNA technology.¡£<br/><br/>
        FDA addresses need of the hour for generic industry: Due to development andregulatory challenges, the complex
        generic space is relatively underpenetratedcompared to traditional generics (generic penetration in key complex
        drug classese.g. injectables, long-acting injectables, inhalers etc. range between 8-45%compared to more than
        80% generic penetration in oral solids). A lack of establishedregulatory pathways has resulted in the entry of
        only a few players in recent complexgenerics approvals like gRenvela tab (Aurobindo, Dr Reddy¡¯s), gLialda
        (Cadila), andgCopaxone 40mg (Mylan/Natco). Furthermore, only few players have tried or aretrying to develop
        generics for upcoming key opportunities like Advair Diskus,Suboxone Film, NuvaRing, Welchol, Nasonex, Canasa,
        etc (Refer page 3for details).Hence, we believe the FDA¡¯s initiative is the much required move towards
        addressingthe need of the industry to drive earnings growth for generic players.¡£</p>
