    <p> We attended a reverse roadshow held by PetroChina (857:HK 每 N-R) in Xinjiang Province last week. Weexpect gas
        demand to remain strong and believe limited piped gas supply will lead to higher liquefiednatural gas (LNG)
        price and volume in the coming winter heating season and in 2018. We note investorconcerns about a potential
        margin squeeze for gas distributors. However, we think increasing LNG prices willease competition on piped gas.
        Given our expectation of stronger gas sales in 4Q17E and the potential forhigher gas sales margin in 4Q17E and
        18E, we remain Overweight.<br/><br/>
        Strong gas demand. We note 1H17 interim earnings of downstream gas distributors are largely in line withmarket
        expectations as higher-than-expected gas sales have offset lower-than-expected gas sales margins.<br/><br/>
        ENN Energy (2688:HK 每 BUY) recorded the highest retail gas sales growth among peers in 1H17, at 26.8%YoY
        (residential: +25% YoY; commercial &amp; industrial: +34% YoY), while China Resources Gas (1193:HK 每
        N-R)reported a 22% YoY growth (residential: +12% YoY; commercial &amp; industrial: +29% YoY) and Towngas
        China(1083:HK 每 N-R) an 18% YoY expansion (industrial: +23% YoY; commercial: +19%). According to
        gasdistributors, the strong commercial &amp; industrial gas demand was mainly due to coal-to-gas conversions
        andChina＊s economic recovery. According to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC),
        China＊sapparent gas consumption grew 30.4% YoY in August 2017, at a significantly higher pace than in
        1H17(+15.2% YoY). Given stronger-than-expected gas sales due to coal-to-gas conversions in northern China
        andcoastal provinces, and the relatively stable economic growth outlook, we expect China＊s gas sales growth
        toreach 25% YoY in 2H17E, leading to +20% YoY in 17E and +15% YoY in 18E.<br/><br/>
        Limited margin pressure. ENN Energy＊s gas sales margin fell to Rmb0.66/m3 in 1H17 (vs Rmb0.74/m3 in1H16), while
        China Resources Gas＊ dropped to Rmb0.64/m3 (vs Rmb0.75/m3 in 1H16). We note investorconcerns about further gas
        sales margin pressure, as a result of increasing competition in point-to-point LNGsupply and direct-gas sales.
        In contrast to market consensus, we see limited potential for further marginsqueeze in point-to-point gas supply
        in 17-18E, as the average commercial &amp; industrial retail gas price ofRmb2.70/m3 is only 7% higher than the
        current LNG price. We also see little incentive for end-consumers toswitch from piped gas to LNG, with LNG less
        than Rmb0.30/m3 cheaper than piped gas.<br/><br/>
        Potential winter gas shortage. Given the upcoming potential winter gas shortage, following the increasedgas
        demand from coal-to-gas conversion and limited upstream piped gas supply, we expect PetroChina toraise by 10-15%
        its benchmark non-residential city-gate price, prior to the upcoming winter. We note theprice of LNG rallied by
        Rmb390/t to Rmb3,519/t in September (vs Rmb2,820/t in September 2016 andRmb3,030/t in 16A), as a result of the
        recent LNG supply shortage. With the potential winter gas shortage,we expect average LNG price to remain high at
        Rmb4,500-5,000/t in 4Q17E and Rmb4200/t in 18E,benefiting upstream LNG suppliers, such as PetroChina, CNOOC,
        Sinopec, Kunlun Energy (135:HK 每 N-R), andENN Energy, which signed overseas LNG supply contracts for 1.4mt at an
        all-in cost of Rmb2,200-2,400/t (itsZhoushan LNG terminal project is scheduled to commence operation in June
        2018). However, we areconcerned about the profitability of residential gas sales in rural areas, due to higher
        gas costs as we expect60-70% of the supply for winter heating to rely on LNG. According to our sensitivity
        analysis, for every pricehike of Rmb100/t of LNG, China Gas (384:HK 每 Outperform) will see its FY18E EPS reduced
        by 0.7%.<br/><br/>
        Remain Overweight. Given expected strong gas sales in 17-18E (two-year Cagr of 18%) and limited marginpressure,
        we think the sector＊s average valuation of 14x 18E PE remains attractive. Thus, we remainOverweight the sector.
        Our top pick is ENN Energy, given its strong earnings growth (15%) and attractivevaluation of 13x 18E PE. By
        contrast, we remain cautious on China Gas given the increasing margin pressureon rural residential gas sales and
        its relatively high valuation of 17x 18E PE.</p>
