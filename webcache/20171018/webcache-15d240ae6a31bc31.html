    <p> After five consecutive misses to the downside, core CPI surprised to the upsidein August. Much of the volatility
        in the past two months is due to large swingsin the lodging away subcomponent, which rose sharply in August
        after plungingin July. Smoothing through this volatility, there are signs that the core inflationtrend is
        firming: the average monthly inflation rate over the past two months is0.18%, which annualizes to 2.2%.
        Alternative Fed measures of the underlyingtrend provide supporting evidence of firmer core inflation.<br/><br/>
        Relative to our expectations, core services inflation was stronger than weanticipated ¨C we had been conservative
        and built in only a modest positivepayback from lodging away. Conversely, core goods inflation was again
        modestlybelow our expectations, with continued weakness in used car prices and adownside miss for
        tobacco.<br/><br/>
        Looking ahead, core CPI inflation is still expected to remain near recent levelsin year-over-year terms through
        2017, with risks that it rounds up to 1.8%. Inmonth-over-month terms, we expect a run rate of about 0.17%
        through year-end.<br/><br/>
        If these forecasts are realized, it should be enough for the Fed to raise rates againin December, assuming that
        other developments are broadly in line with our andthe Fed's expectations.<br/><br/>
        Beyond, our medium-term view that core inflation should normalize remainsintact. Positive base effects, the
        lagged impact of macro momentum (e.g., realGDP growth and ISM), recent dollar weakness, and a tightening labor
        marketcontinue to support a pickup in year-over-year core inflation in 2018.</p>
