    <p> Steel equities continue to be volatile, driven by macro woes and commodity pricemovements. Although current spot
        conditions remain strong, we still forecastcost support to fade, and thus, European prices to fall (current spot
        conditionswould imply significant further earnings upgrades across the space). Our toppicks are: 1)
        ArcelorMittal, which looks attractive to us, based on strong cashflow (7-12% FCF yield), valuation and
        additional upside optionality; and 2)ThyssenKrupp, on a possibly nearing event catalyst (Tata merger),
        recoveringearnings, and improving CF and sentiment.</p>
