    <p> Halyk Bank reported 2Q17 IFRS results and followed up with a conference callto provide updated guidance for full
        year 2017 and KKB (Kazkommertsbank)integration. This is the last time we are seeing Halyk¡¯s standalone results,
        asfrom 3Q17 onwards, the bank will be reporting on a consolidated basisincluding KKB accounts. Overall, the
        results look good, both on a QoQ and YoYbasis. Except for QoQ Balance Sheet contraction, the results
        demonstratedimproving trends on the B/S, P&amp;L;, asset quality and capitalization front. Totalassets grew
        13.4% YoY (-1.3% QoQ) to USD16bn, driven by a 37.4% YoYincrease in the Securities portfolio. Gross loan book
        expanded modestly by5.5% YoY, although was down 3.6% QoQ, breaking the sequence of fourconsecutive quarterly
        increases. The quarterly decline in loan book was mainlyon account of loan repayments exceeding new loan
        issuances. On theliabilities side, Customer deposits declined 6.3% QoQ, partly due to a lowerbalance of FX
        deposits on account of the KZT appreciation and partly due tocorporate withdrawals. However, these were still up
        6.6% YoY and 2.2% YTD.<br/><br/>
        The P&amp;L; performance was even more impressive registering healthy growthboth on a QoQ and YoY basis driven
        by higher interest earning assets,repayment of a high coupon bearing Eurobond in May 2017 and higher incomefrom
        securities portfolio. Net interest income (NII) grew 27% YoY (+6.5% QoQ)driving Pre-provision income up 18.3%
        YoY (+3.4% QoQ). Adjusted NIM, asper our calculation, grew by a healthy 140bps YoY and 50bps QoQ to 5.9%.</p>
