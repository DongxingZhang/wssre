    <p> The four Indonesia＊s F&amp;B; companies we cover 每 Indofood CBP (Reduce), Indofood SuksesMakmur (Hold), Kalbe
        Farma (Hold) and Unilever Indonesia (Hold) 每 appear to be in pretty goodshape. In broad terms, over the past few
        years, they have recorded strong EPS growth whilemaintaining strong cash positions and low levels of gearing. As
        a result, they have beenrewarded with higher PE multiples.﹝<br/><br/>
        Today, the valuations of these companies are generally high. The F&amp;B; companies with theexception of
        Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF) trade at premiums relative to the Jakarta StockExchange Composite Index (JCI) in
        terms of both PE and EV/EBITDA multiples. This is themain reason behind our Hold ratings on three out of the
        four stocks under our coverage.﹝<br/><br/>
        Against the backdrop of slower consumption growth in the first half of 2017, we believe it is timeto take a
        fresh look at the sector＊s fundamentals and likely future direction. Thus, we introducewhat we call the ※five
        fundamentals§ framework to assess the fundamental strengths andweaknesses of these companies without taking into
        account their individual valuations.﹝<br/><br/>
        In the first half of 2017, most Indonesian consumer companies reported relatively weakearnings growth y-o-y as
        consumption growth slowed. Annual GDP growth has been about5.0% since 2014. While the rate was 5.0% in both 1Q
        and 2Q 2017, it was weaker thanexpected in 2Q as HSBC＊s economist had forecast 5.1%. Growth in private
        consumption wasrelatively weak at 4.9% y-o-y. Another important factor that indicated just how weakconsumption
        was in 2Q 2017was that Lebaran, a major national holiday associated with strongconsumer spending, was in 2Q in
        2017vs. 3Q in 2016. In August, Indonesia's central bank cutits benchmark policy rate 每 the first change since
        October 每 in a bid to boost economic growth.﹝</p>
