    <p> The press conference today announcing the beginning of the third phase of the5G R&amp;D; trials in China was
        broadly as anticipated. Bulls of 5G investmentwould take comfort that the regulator (¡°MIIT¡±) appears keen to
        accelerate thedevelopment time table and that China Telecom is leaning towards astandalone 5G network (which
        would cost more to set up upfront than nonstandalone).<br/><br/>
        That said there is limited clarity on final 5G investment size andoperators¡¯ network roll-out plans and that the
        application scenarios remainlacking with the MIIT starting a competition for developing 5G
        applications.<br/><br/>
        Taking these together we continue to expect a more moderate investment pathfor the Chinese operator to support
        the 5G development in China but not soburdensome that it would impede their return profile.</p>
