    <p> In our two-day coal-to-gas trip, we visited four gas distributors in Hebei andTianjin, including ENN (2688 HK),
        Bestsun (600681 SH), Tianjin Jinran (1265 HK)and Binhai investment (2886 HK). Besides meeting the management, we
        alsovisited several industrial users and rural villages and below are the key takeaways.<br/><br/>
        Coal to gas outlook: Management generally believes central government¡¯ssupportive stance on coal-to-gas
        conversion will not be affected by the gasshortage, but implementation by the local government will be in a more
        orderlymanner going forward. Rural coal-to-gas was done aggressively in 2017 dueto central/local government
        pushes, while the targets for 2018 have not beendiscussed or finalized for many local governments. For
        industrial coal-to-gasconversion, it is mandatory from many local governments and new plants areusually not
        allowed to use coal.<br/><br/>
        Coal to gas project economics: For rural residential coal-to-gas conversion,companies all prefer those projects
        near their own pipeline networks as it willprovide better gas supply safety and require less investment.
        Managementhas all expressed their concerns over those projects supplied by LNG. Overall,management expects the
        return for rural projects is less than urban ones, and thereturn is likely to decrease gradually after those
        high-quality rural projects beingconverted.<br/><br/>
        Subsidy payment: For the industrial players we visited, the equipment cost forcoal-to-gas conversion in Langfang
        is fully subsidized by the government. Thenewly built heating stations for Volkswagen industrial park in Tianjin
        receiveno subsidy and it is mandatory to use natural gas. For rural projects, theconnection fee subsidy is paid
        to distributors after the completion checks by localgovernments and the payment has been received for those
        projects we visited.<br/><br/>
        Gas sales subsidy is transferred to distributors first before being refunded to endusers.<br/><br/>
        Winter gas shortage: All of the companies have experienced supply shortagein Dec 2017 to different degrees but
        all think that the shortage is easedrecently. Management generally expects a further mitigation of supply
        shortagein Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area due to the commencement of Sinopec¡¯s Tianjin LNG terminal and ShaanJing IV
        pipeline, as well as the increase in gas import fromTurkmenistan.<br/><br/>
        Winter cost hike pass through: Gas distributors usually estimates a blended costhike and then pass though it to
        end users. For Jinran Gas, the government allowsa Rmb0.25/cm increase in C&amp;I; end user price, which is based
        on the estimatedblended cost hike of the company. Bestsun and Binhai had a full cost pass throughto C&amp;I;
        users according to the management.<br/><br/>
        Stock implications: We like gas distributors with solid track record, high exposureto key coal-to-gas region,
        improving free cash flow and good capex discipline. Weprefer ENN Energy within gas sector due to robust net
        profit CAGR (&gt;15% over2017-19E), strong volume growth boosted by coal-to-gas, potential cost savingfrom its
        LNG import contracts and rising dividend payout.</p>
