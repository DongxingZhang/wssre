    <p> Commentary for Monday: This week¡¯s economic data docket is relatively sparse,and may be even less so if the
        government shuts down. At the time of publication,the Senate had not yet voted on a four-week continuing
        resolution passed by theHouse and it appeared that the government was heading toward a shutdown.The House is
        scheduled to be in recess until January 29so this is pretty much atake-it or leave-it deal for the Senate, which
        requires Democratic votes to pass.In the event of a partial closure of the federal government, the BEA and
        BLSwould most likely not release its usual economic statistics, as was the case in themost recent shutdown of
        October 2013. Indeed, the lack of government-reportedeconomic data is arguably the most tangible impact of a
        partial closure of thefederal government. As we detailed in our note last week, a government shutdown¡ªassuming
        it is short-term in nature¡ªwould have little impact on the economyor the Fed¡¯s outlook for rate hikes.</p>
