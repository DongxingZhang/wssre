    <p> Luk Fook reported +1% overall SSSg, a weaker yoy performance than the markethad anticipated. To recap, Luk Fook
        reported +17% overall SSSg in 3QFY17.<br/><br/>
        Management attributes the weaker 3QFY18 performance to: 1) high base in3QFY17, while competitors have a lower
        gem-set base, which is a driver for salesof major jewellery retailers; 2) higher gold price not enough to offset
        volumedecline while Luk Fook offered fewer promotions than competitors to protectGPM.<br/><br/>
        Following the results release, the company guided down its FY18 SSSexpectation for the China operations to SD
        from DD given at the 1HFY18 resultsbriefing. Its OPM should be stable at ~10% level, regardless of GP variation.<br/><br/>
        By product, gem-set is doing better in HK because, in HK, LF offers morecarat gold products with sophisticated
        designs and exclusive design fixed goldproducts. It is harder to sell fixed gold products in Mainland so there
        is deeperdiscounting going on.<br/><br/>
        By country, China showed a deterioration in SSSg to -4% in 3QFY18 from 11%in 3QFY17, mainly due to a bigger
        decline in sales volume than in ASP (+LSDincrease in ASP as gold price increased by 5% during 3QFY18). Stores
        sawtraffic decline on weekdays and at weekends. Public holiday sales are subduedas shopping sentiment is low
        under government restrictions.<br/><br/>
        Hong Kong saw DD decline in ASP but positive overall SSS growth (+1%) thanksto good sales of lower GPM
        fixed-gold products (reported under the gem-setcategory) and value-for-money gem-set products. October and
        December SSSgare not good as customers preferred long distance travel to shorter trips to HK.<br/><br/>
        Further acceleration of new openings in China. There were 71 net store openings(mainly licensed stores) almost
        double the openings in 2QFY18/3QFY17 (34 and38, respectively). YTD openings exceed management's full year 2018
        guidance of80 (albeit quite a conservative target as management commented in December2017).</p>
