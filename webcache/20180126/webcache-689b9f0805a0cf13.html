    <p> Physical players moved from short to neutral<br/><br/>
        It is well known that crude oil non-commercial positioning has risen to newheights, particularly in WTI, less so
        in Brent. Not often mentioned is the fact thatpositioning by producers, merchants, processors and users also
        conspired to helpoil prices move higher. Since mid 2017, commercial WTI positioning has movedfrom short -200k
        contracts to neutral. The change is comparable to the move innon-commercial positioning over the same period,
        +263k contracts.<br/><br/>
        This suggests that industrial users have been more aggressive than a year ago inadding WTI hedges to secure
        purchase prices than producers have been in lockingin sale prices. Our US oil &amp; gas analyst team's
        assessment of hedge ratios showsthat current 2017/18producer hedging of 33%/16% is rather similar to last
        year's2016/17hedge ratios of 34%/13%. Such neutral commercial WTI positioning hasbeen rare in the last ten
        years, Figure 4, and would only have to rise by a further69k contracts to match the previous high of +60k
        contracts in August 2013.Commercial hedging has been more static in Brent, however, where positioningis little
        changed from a year ago and remains heavily net short, Figure 3.<br/><br/>
        No bid for storage<br/><br/>
        In keeping with the improved fundamental outlook (-200kb/d deficit instead ofbalanced in 2018), we take note of
        the traded prices for crude oil storage at theLouisiana Offshore Oil Terminal (LOOP), which is now down to a
        very low levelof USD 0.04/bbl/month, Figure 5. This is well below long term storage contractrates at Cushing and
        Gulf Coast terminals, indicating little demand for storingsurplus barrels in the US. Undoubtedly, this is helped
        by strong rates of crude oilexport, Figure 6, which have helped to reduce the inventory surplus.
        WTI-Brentremaining at the wide end of transport costs means that crude oil exports shouldremain high, in our
        view.<br/><br/>
        Next up: refinery maintenance<br/><br/>
        The next seasonal trend will be the onset of spring refinery maintenance, peakingin early March in the US and in
        early April globally, Figure 7. Although wehave been accustomed to seeing Q4/Q1weakness in the last three years,
        bothfundamentally and in prices, a longer history of average fundamental supplydemandbalance since 1986suggests
        that Q4/Q1are actually the strongestquarters. This picture would make more sense in the context of the
        seasonalpattern of global refinery maintenance being lowest in Q1. The progression ofhigher maintenance outages
        over the quarter is a bearish factor to watch.</p>
