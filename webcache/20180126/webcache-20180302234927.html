    <p> Barring unanticipated changes in underlying expectations of a settled electoralredelineation exercise and
        three-way contests, our base case outcome for thegeneral elections (GE14; likely March/April) is continuity re
        the ruling BarisanNasional coalition. With manner of the victory potentially having repercussionsre post-GE14
        policy direction, investors should use pre-GE14 market volatilityto optimise positions for the long game,
        favouring sector dominants (AirAsia,Inari, Top Glove) and value GLCs (Tenaga, Telekom); we note
        positioned-forthe-LT laggards (SP Setia, Gent(M), MAHB) and advise cutting weightings instructurally-vulnerable
        erstwhile market leaders like Gamuda, DiGi and PETD.<br/><br/>
        Favoured sectors are banks (CIMB, HL Bank, RHB), construction (AQRS,Econpile), exporters (Inari, Top Glove) and
        transport/logistics (AirAsia, POS).</p>
