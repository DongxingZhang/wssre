    <p> Airtel and Jio take different routes to content - partnership vs ownership is thekey issue<br/><br/>
        Airtel has announced a partnership with Amazon to bundle its primemembership in India ( Rs 999) for one year
        with its post-paid plans withmonthly ARPU of Rs 499or higher. These post-paid plans typically offer 30GBor more
        data/month. The membership, activated via the Airtel TV app willallow for Amazon Prime content to be available
        for the Airtel subscribers. Airtelhas an investment in a music streaming service called Wynk.<br/><br/>
        Jio already bundles significant content with its plans<br/><br/>
        We note that Jio¡¯s plans currently include a free subscription to TV channels, alarge movie library (Jio movies)
        and a large pool magazines. Content bundling,besides price was one of the key differentiator during the recent
        launch of Jio¡¯s4G LTE featurephone (Jiophone). Unlike Airtel, Jio has ownership of its movielibrary and
        investment in TV and digital content.<br/><br/>
        India is a large market for content consumption but monetisation viasubscription remains a challenge<br/><br/>
        The ¡®ad-funded¡¯ model is the more prevalent method of content monetisationadvertisingaccounts for c40% of the
        media industry revenues. Further thesector regulator has titled away from content exclusivity and deals to
        limitconsumer choice of availability of content across various platforms.<br/><br/>
        With India rapidly moving into large data bundles, content bundling wasexpected to be the next differentiator as
        has been the case in other markets.Optus has used its exclusive deal for English Premier League to
        drivesubscriber acquisitions in Australia. Telstra has recently bundled Foxtel tocounter Optus. Singtel has been
        bundling Spotify subscription with a few of itsplans. Starhub offers its cable content to its mobile subscribers
        via the StarhubGo app.</p>
