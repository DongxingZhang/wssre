    <p> Mr. Waili Li, Director of Information and Industrial Development Unit, StateInformation Center, presented at our
        Access China conference on 10January.Key highlights:<br/><br/>
        - In 2017, the growth rate of commercial vehicles (CV) was higher than that ofpassenger vehicles (PV) for the
        first time. Within the CV sector, truck growth(especially for heavy-duty) was higher than that of bus. This is
        driven by thecrackdown on truck overloading being extended to provincial highways, but theimpact might not be
        sustainable.- Meanwhile, weak PV sales growth is an aftermath of demand being pulledforward by tax stimulus. On
        the positive side, OEMs' supply discipline supportstransaction prices.<br/><br/>
        - The State Information Center still believes in the long-term growth potential ofChina's auto sector based on
        still-low ownership. Meanwhile, it expects China'sPV wholesale to grow by c.3% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        - Mr. Li thinks that, in the long run, the new energy vehicle (NEV) market will notonly be driven by government
        polices but also by market demand. Currently, NEVsales in China are largely concentrated in cities with auto
        purchase restrictions,while the percentage of non-private purchases (52%) is higher than that of private(48%).
        However, with the functionality and quality improvements for mid-to-highendNEVs, amid increasing foreign OEM
        participation, private demand shouldboom.<br/><br/>
        - As artificial intelligence (AI) is a national strategy, intelligent connected vehicles(ICV) should grow fast
        in China, and the demand will probably be driven by theyoung generation. With more software being used in ICVs,
        software companieswill be increasingly involved in the auto sector.</p>
