    <p> At its first interest rate swap (IRS) tender of 2018, the National Bank of Hungary¡¯soffered a lower amount of 5
        year and 1-year IRS than the market had expected. Thiscaused a spike in longer-dated bond and swap rates. This
        follows a rebound in EURfront-end rates earlier last week amid a repricing of 1y1y EONIA after hawkish
        ECBcomments.<br/><br/>
        We think that the rates market is at risk of moving ahead of the FX market, whereEURHUF has been relatively
        stable.<br/><br/>
        In our view, the NBH¡¯s reaction function considers the overall tightness of financialconditions including the FX
        rate. Last year, when the NBH decided to extend itseasing programme to longer-dated securities, it argued that
        the programme¡¯s aim wasto offset overall tight monetary conditions caused by HUF appreciation. We think
        thisapproach will still hold going forward.<br/><br/>
        Trade: Long 10mio EURHUF at 309.20, targeting 315, stop loss 307.50. Receive 5y HUFIRS at 102bp, targeting 80bp,
        with stop loss 115bp.</p>
