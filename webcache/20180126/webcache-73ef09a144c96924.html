    <p> We continue to expect the Bank of Korea (BoK) to keep its policy rate unchanged when it meets on Thursday and
        the decision to be unanimous. In the unlikely event of a dissent, i.e. calling for a rate hike, then we will
        take that as a clear signal from the BoK that it intends to hike soon.<br/><br/>
        While we have maintained our view that the next 25bps rate hike is likely to take place in Q3, rising housing
        prices in Gangnam and sharply higher oil prices, among others, may strengthen resolve of the BoK hawks to push
        policy rate higher at a faster pace. However, there are underlying weakness in the housing market and a tail
        risk to growth that warrant attention and caution, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Korea¡¯s housing prices continued to head higher, especially in the political sensitive areas like Gangnam.
        Gangnam housing prices rose 5.6%yoy in December, up further from the 4.3% rise reported in November. There are
        obvious concerns that the BoK may opt for more aggressive rate hikes to support the government¡¯s efforts in
        taming the housing market. The government is now contemplating additional capital gain tax hikes, among other
        things. Over a decade ago, as Korea's housing price inflation reached double digits at its peak in 2005-07, the
        BoK deliver a total of 175bps. In contrast to before, however, Korea's housing price inflation hover only about
        1% today, as some regional areas struggle with falling housing prices, while the number of unsold homes
        continues to rise. Moreover, Korea¡¯s household debt is sharply higher now, at 83% of GDP in Q3 2017 vs. 58% of
        GDP in Q3 2005, warranting greater caution with rate hikes. Having said that, however, we acknowledge that
        housing price inflation is an important determinant of economic policies which may garner greater attention as
        Korea prepares for local elections in June.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, rising oil prices hint at an upward revision to the BoK¡¯s headline inflation forecast. Back in
        October, the BoK released its CPI inflation forecast of 1.8%, assuming that oil prices would average USD54/bbl
        this year. Our own commodity analysts have recently revised up their average oil price forecasts by 14% to
        USD62bbl (Brent) for this year, vs. USD55/bbl in 2017. In response, we see this year's CPI inflation about
        0.2ppts higher than our forecast earlier, at 1.9%. We may see a similar revision to the BoK's forecast, unless
        it assumes a significantly stronger won now than before.<br/><br/>
        Although we are having a hard time finding statistical evidence, the BoK may consider this year¡¯s 16% hike in
        minimum wages as meaningful risks to its inflation outlook. Positive effects of higher minimum wages, however,
        may be rather limited, given the unintended negative consequences on employment, despite the government¡¯s
        efforts to subsidize affected businesses.</p>
