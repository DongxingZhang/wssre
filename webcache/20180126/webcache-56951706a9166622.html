    <p> Full-year REI growth softened further<br/><br/>
        Full-year REI growth softened further to 7.0% y-y (vs. 7.5% in 11M17) despitethe continual improvement in new
        starts (+8.6% y-y in December vs. 6.9% in11M17) and land sales value (+63% y-y in December vs. 47% in 11M17).
        Withinventory staying low, new starts picking up with more land sales, andcommodity prices staying high, we
        expect REI growth to stay in the highsingle-digits in 2018F.<br/><br/>
        Sales remained resilient in Dec; we expect strong sales to continue in January<br/><br/>
        Stronger than we expected, December property sales remained resilient,growing 6.1% y-y in volume (vs. 7.9% in
        11M17) and 20.5% in value (vs. 12.7%in 11M17), despite the high base. Full-year sales have reached
        anotherhistorical high of 1.7bn sqm (+7.7% y-y) and RMB13.4trn (+13.7% y-y). Weexpect the strong sales momentum
        to continue in January, and largedevelopers will continue to beat given the significant growth of their
        saleableresources, improved execution, and later Lunar New Year (in mid-February vs.late January last
        year).<br/><br/>
        Full-year land sales volume up 16% y-y, but undersupply remains<br/><br/>
        Land area sold was up 12.4% y-y in December (vs. 16.3% in 11M17) while landvalue sold rallied 63% y-y (vs. 47%
        in 11M17). Although the full-year land salesvolume has increased 15.8% y-y to 255mn sqm, this is still 24-38%
        below2011-2014 levels. With new starts remaining stable (+7.0% y-y in 2017 vs.+8.1% in 2016), we believe
        inventory is unlikely to pick up in the short term(currently at 10/9/12 months in T1/2/3 cities, based on our
        estimates).<br/><br/>
        Recommendations and risks<br/><br/>
        We expect more divergence in listcos¡¯ sales growth, due to their differentstrategies and execution. We think
        competition will remain fierce in T1/2 citiesin 2018 (despite overall market possibly recovering), while listed
        T3-city playerswill consolidate the low-tier market further given their strong execution andbrand equity. We
        suggest investors accumulate developers with strongexecution records or abundant saleable resources, including
        Country Garden,Vanke, Logan and Aoyuan. We value stocks using NAV for existing projects.<br/><br/>
        Key risks are further credit/policy tightening.</p>
