    <p> Mr Moke, founder of RealLi Research, attended our 2018 dbAccess Chinaconference in Beijing. During the
        conference meeting with investors, Mr Mokeshared his views on China¡¯s EV battery direction and the outlook on
        industryconsolidation, and gave a positive medium-term view. We summarize the investormeeting below.<br/><br/>
        Government policies have been driving the EV industry since 2009 throughvarious levels of subsidies, but Mr Moke
        believes the target is to realizeEV commercialization without support after 2020, assuming both of
        thegovernment¡¯s targets can be reached: a) the energy density level of a batterysystem to surpass 260wh/kg and
        b) battery pack cost to be lower than RMB1/wh.<br/><br/>
        Thanks to high energy density and strong demand from the New Energy Vehicle(NEV) PV segment, NCM batteries, for
        the first time in history, commanded amarket share similar to that of LFP batteries at c.45-48% in
        2017.<br/><br/>
        The energy density level of overall battery pack is expected to reach 140wh/kg byend 2017 and increase to
        175wh/kg in 2018 before reaching the government¡¯s2020 target of 260wh/kg ( a 3-year CAGR of 23%), mainly driven
        by subsidyrequirements. Leading domestic battery makers, including CATL and Farasis,have made progress
        especially in the past two years, with energy density levelachieving 220wh/kg, similar to that of LG Chem. In
        terms of manufacturing yield,there is still room for leading domestic battery makers to improve against
        Koreanplayers.</p>
