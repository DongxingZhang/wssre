    <p> The NCPO has of late invoked Section 44 of the interim constitution to float the localprice of sugar to be on a
        par with the global rate and scrap the domestic quota system tocomply with WTO rules and defend against
        accusations of foul play from Brazil over thecountry¡¯s subsidies for its sugar producers. The price float is

        on bigger returns from sugar sales thanunder the previous structure as detailed in the following figure</p>
