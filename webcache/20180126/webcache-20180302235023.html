    <p> Recommendation Summary.<br/><br/>
        We initiate on the ?4.375% Sr. Sec ¡¯22 and ? 4.875% Sr Sec '24 with aCreditSell recommendation and on the ? Sr
        Sec FRN ¡¯23 with a CreditHoldrecommendation, on valuation grounds as we don¡¯t believe a 3-4% return isattractive
        considering the acquisitive nature and FCF profile. We recognize thatmanagement has successfully integrated a
        number of acquisitions and hasdelivered on the identified synergies and we are confident they will deliver onthe
        CME acquisition savings. While we recognize the asset cover, we don¡¯tbelieve the current price levels reflect
        the limited de-leveraging and see a fewpoints of downside.<br/><br/>
        Leverage levels higher on M&amp;A; and PIK push-down.<br/><br/>
        Leverage levels of 5.2x net debt / LHA EBITDA including synergies and 5.8xexcluding synergies increased from c.
        4.0x cash-pay leverage pre therecapitalization. The increase was driven by the refinancing of the outstandingPIK
        note at the operating entity (+0.9x) and on the back of M&amp;A.; On July 9,2017, the company announced the
        acquisition of CME Croatian and SlovenianTV Assets for a total consideration of ?230m, equivalent to an EV/LTM
        EBITDAmultiple of 13.9x, and 5.5x, when adjusting for synergies (?25m). Thetransaction is subject to regulatory
        approvals and ?200m of the proceedsraised from the bond deal are being held in escrow until May 2018 (par
        returnof ?200m 4.375% Sr Sec '22, if transactions don¡¯t close).<br/><br/>
        Asset cover ¨C need to adjust accounting.<br/><br/>
        As a potential comparable, Digi Communications (RCS&amp;RDS;, last closing price:RON38) trades at an EV/ 2017E
        EBITDA of 5.6x and EV/ 2018E EBITDA 5.2x.<br/><br/>
        EV/OCF trading multiples are 10.5x and 8.7x, respectively. At face value thiswould suggest limited asset cover
        at our issuer. However, when adjusting DigiCommunications EBITDA to align accounting for content costs, we
        believe Digitrades on 6.6x 2017e and 6.2x 2018e EBITDA multiples and 24x and 17x onOCF multiples.<br/><br/>
        Leading TV channels in respective countries.<br/><br/>
        Pop TV in Slovenia and Nova TV in Croatia are leading TV Groups in theirrespective countries. The POP Slovenia
        portfolio includes five channels withPOP TV being the flagship channel with a 81% TV ad market share
        whichhistorically was transmitted free-to-air).The Nova Croatia portfolio includes 4channels including the
        flagship Nova TV with a 54% TV ad market share. Bothgroups include numerous internet portals and
        VOD/subscription systems.<br/><br/>
        Update on regulatory approvals.<br/><br/>
        In Slovenia, they have received a positive decision from the Ministry of Cultureby which the transaction was de
        facto approved while they are still waitingapproval from the Slovenian national competition authority which is
        expectedsoon. However, in Croatia, the company faced a setback as the CroatianAgency for Electronic Media
        blocked Nova TV takeover, citing restrictions oncross ownership considering its existing Total TV asset with 30K
        subscribers.<br/><br/>
        On the Q317 call, management mentioned that they are reviewing potentialoptions and on Jan 12, 2018, announced
        the disposal of Total TV. The CMEassets purchase agreement is valid only if both assets receive approval.</p>
