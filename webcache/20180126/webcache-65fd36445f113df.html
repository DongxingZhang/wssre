    <p> By the time the Economist (that paragon of conventional wisdom) places techgiants on its cover, it is clear that
        discomfort with tech dominance must havepenetrated deeply. The question however is whether after a decade
        ofdebates, we have reached the stage that governments and regulators arefinally ready to push back? After all,
        it has been clear for years that Google,Facebook and Amazon have effectively become gatekeepers to key
        societalfunctions, such as dissemination of views, publishing, and distribution whilealso emerging as
        indispensable tools for social interactions. They marshalfree information from consumers and businesses and
        commercialize it viamarketing and advertising channels. Also, Amazon more than anyone elsehas been responsible
        for destroying conventional retail models.<br/><br/>
        These companies have been undoubtedly the key facilitators of societaldisruption and there is also growing
        evidence that they empty publicdiscussion space, polarize opinions and reduce marginal costs across variousjobs
        and professions. And yet, anybody who has spent time commuting towork knows how addictive these services are, as
        they prey on human urge toconnect. Together with gaming, these tech giants are increasingly creating ageneration
        that is addicted to visual stimuli. The human brain is not wired forreading but it is strongly biased to images
        and quick response. Hence gamingaddictions and creeping social isolation is becoming the dominant trend.</p>
