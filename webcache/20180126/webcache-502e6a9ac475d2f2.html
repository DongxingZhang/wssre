    <p> Production capacities may go up in 2018<br/><br/>
        Baosteel expected the steel industry to release more production capacities in2018because the de-capacity target
        for 2018in China at 25mtpa is only halfof the target for 2017at 50mtpa. The company¡¯s new EAF productions and
        thecompleted capacity replacement projects may drive its production capacities togo up in 2018. The main
        capacity replacement projects are Phase I (c.4mtpa) andPhase II (c.4mtpa) of Rizhao steel mill in Shandong
        Province. Phase II will be putinto operation in the second half of 2018according to the company.<br/><br/>
        Mild price correction and continually resilient spread in 2018<br/><br/>
        In 2017, overcapacity cut and winter production shutdown policy affected steelcompanies¡¯ production capacities
        and the commencement of new construction,which drove the steel price to largely increase. The rebar price
        particularlyexceeded RMB5,000/t in December 2017with gross profit margin at c.RMB1,500/t. Thus, price correction
        began at end-2017and may continue in 2018. Baosteelexpected the rebar price to drop by RMB800/t from the current
        price level. As theeffects of the government policies that were executed in 2017may extend into2018, the company
        expects a mild price correction and guided steel spread tostay relatively resilient with stable annual average
        selling price in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Long steel profits may not have premium over flat steel profits in 2018<br/><br/>
        Long steel was overall more profitable than flat steel in 2017. However, thissituation is contradictory to the
        demand trends of long steel and flat steel. Marketdata showed a stable trend of flat steel demand from auto and
        home applianceindustries and a declining trend of long steel demand from infrastructure andproperty industries.
        Thus, the outlook of flat steel in 2018should be more positivethan long steel. Long steel profits may not have
        premium over flat steel profitsin 2018.<br/><br/>
        Ramping up EAF may become a trend<br/><br/>
        In 2017, IF furnace was fully replaced by EAF and BF. Although the governmenthas not promulgated policies to
        promote EAF, Baosteel started EAF productionduring 2017(2mtpa in 2018). The industry¡¯s EAF capacities should
        remain thesame at 15mtpa in 2018. The company¡¯s production output of EAF in 2018willbe higher than 2017because
        of the full-year operation in 2018.</p>
