    <p> Metal and Mining companies we met at Access China (China Hongqiao,Aluminum Corporation of China, China Coal
        Energy and China Shenhua)continue to be sanguine on demand though acknowledging that prices maycorrect from
        recent highs. Interestingly, coal companies did mention that newcapacity approvals may start from 2018 which
        along with other policyinitiatives such as consolidation, NDRC¡¯s push for long term coal contracts(75% of coal
        production/consumption through long term contracts) should leadto better demand/supply equilibrium. Outside
        metals and mining, West Chinawas positive on cement demand for 2018 driven by new infrastructure projectsin
        Shaanxi as well as property construction remaining robust (driven by 2017marketing sales and land auctions).
        Health and Happiness also expectsrevenue momentum to remain robust in 2018 (10-15% topline growth YoYfrom
        combination of higher volume and planned IMF ASP increase) with mostpolicy/regulatory uncertainty behind them.
        We upgraded H&amp;H; 2021s to Buy inour 2018 outlook report and continue to like it.<br/><br/>
        As regards subsequent field trip, amongst the companies under our coverage,the Ruyi meeting was mixed as company
        expects operational performance tocontinue to be robust though aggressive capex may continue in the form ofM&amp;A.;
        Shandong Ruyi Technology, USD bond issuer entity, may lead theconsortium to buy INVISTA¡¯s Apparel &amp; Advanced
        Textiles business (Lycrabrand owner) instead of earlier expectation of the transaction being done at theparent
        level. That said, company is likely to include third party investors,similar to SMCP¡¯s acquisition, which will
        somewhat limit funding requirement.<br/><br/>
        Company is also considering other measures to deleverage including potentialdebt to equity swap at its
        subsidiaries. As for Hilong, company expects recentrally in oil price to augur well for 2018 order book which is
        already quiterobust. Capex remains limited for oil field equipment segment though recentaward of new contracts
        under oil field services segment may lead to slightincrease in capex (for buying 1-2 rigs). We currently have
        Buy on Ruyi (2019 &amp;2022s) and Hilong 2020s and maintain our positive view on both. As for eHi,discussion was
        mostly on recent updates and we maintain our neutral view onthe bonds.</p>
