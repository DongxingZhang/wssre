    <p> Electronics: Remain positive on Apple supply chain<br/><br/>
        Weaker-than-expected sales of the iPhone 8/8+ have triggered concerns about upcoming iPhoneshipments. However,
        we do not think this will constitute a negative over the long term. In fact, slowersales of the iPhone 8will
        tilt the structure of iPhone shipments further towards the iPhone X. Wemaintain our view that the iPhone X is
        driving a new innovation cycle for consumer electronics, andremain positive on key companies on the Apple supply
        chain. Given ongoing issues at overseasiPhone component suppliers, we highlight potential opportunities for
        Chinese component makers tobenefit from a spill-over of orders.</p>
