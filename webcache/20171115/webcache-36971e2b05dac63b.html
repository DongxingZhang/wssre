    <p> Consumer: 2018sector outlook ¨C positive on consumption upgrade and rising industryconcentration<br/><br/>
        We have a positive view on consumption upgrade driven by income growth, and we expect domesticretail sales to
        demonstrate resilience with mild growth; furthermore, sub-sector leaders will benefitfrom rising industry
        concentration. While China¡¯s economic growth will give rise to higher vehicledemand, 1Q18auto sales volume might
        be affected by the withdrawal of car purchasing subsidies.We expect PV sales volume growth of 4% in 2018. Amid
        increasing education spending by Chinesehouseholds, a short supply of higher education resources has resulted in
        strength in the K12tutoringspace. Lastly, we expect domestic tourism revenue and number of trips to maintain
        growth of ~10%.<br/><br/>
