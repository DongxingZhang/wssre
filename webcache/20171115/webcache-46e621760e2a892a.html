    <p> We met with five major private-sector Taiwan financials (Cathay, Fubon, CTBC, E.SUN,and Taishin), Easycard (an
        established electronic stored-value card company), Pay2Go(an electronic payment institution), and Lend (a
        peer-to-peer [P2P] lending company)over 30¨C31October 2017. Key meeting takeaways are as follows:<br/><br/>
        Near-term hit due to intense competition on the payment battleground. Leadingprivate banks are adopting a
        multi-platform approach to cooperate with new entrantswhile investing in new technologies, especially in mobile
        payment. While banks see lessthreat from new payment service providers, some banks have increased their rebates
        toretain existing customers and attract customers from peers. While credit card fees willlikely keep increasing
        along with the rise in the electronic payment ratio, cost pressuresmay intensify in the near term, with banks
        keeping their rebates at a high level.<br/><br/>
        Fintech can help with profitability in the medium term through efficiencyenhancement and customer base
        activation to private financials. The financialshave also been upgrading their infrastructure and support
        functions to enhanceefficiency, but they continue to see areas for improvement. While it is hard to quantifythe
        enhancement now, we may have more clarity in two to three years¡¯ time. Theremay also be a bonus from overseas
        market expansion and grooming successfulstart-ups in the long run for financials that collaborate with
        established techcompanies or invest in promising new start-ups.<br/><br/>
        E.SUN and Cathay, both Buy rated, are better positioned than their peers tobenefit from fintech development.
        E.SUN is recognised by peers and the marketas a fintech development leader in Taiwan, evidenced by the
        achievements it hasmade in payment and lending. Cathay, on the other hand, has been rapidly rampingup its army
        of fintech talent to promote fintech development in the whole organisation.Key catalysts to watch for are signs
        of efficiency (cost-income ratio) improvement andsuccessful fintech initiatives. We change no ratings or
        estimates in this note, butadjust our target prices by c3% as we roll forward our valuation basis to 2018e.</p>
