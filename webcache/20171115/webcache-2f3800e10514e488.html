    <p> Chinese Banking Sector: 9M17results review ¨C earnings improved from 1H17with slowerpace of NPL
        formation<br/><br/>
        The fundamentals of the banking sector have improved steadily with moderating regulatory pressureand slower NPL
        formation thanks to supply-side reform and an economy recovery. Given a stabilizingNIS, rebounding intermediary
        business revenue and substantial improvement in asset quality, webelieve the upward trend in banking performance
        can be maintained in 4Q17and that the overall netprofit growth of listed banks should be around 5% in 2017. In
        4Q17, as a result of a steady andneutral monetary policy environment, deepening interest rate liberalization and
        financialdisintermediation, the pressure from competition in the deposit business has remained
        intense,especially for small- and medium-sized banks.</p>
