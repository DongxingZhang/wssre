    <p> F&amp;B;: 2018sector outlook ¨C sector seeking growth amid pressure from consumption upgrade<br/><br/>
        Rising property prices have helped drive a recovery in consumer spending on luxury goods, whilethe
        popularization of mobile payment and consumer loans have also spurred consumer demand. Webelieve that the
        overall risk in the economy will be manageable in 2018, and that consumerconfidence should remain stable with
        consumption upgrade to remain an important industry trend.The large number of F&amp;B; companies with outdated
        brands have suffered greatly from the significanttrend of consumption upgrade. Looking into 2018, we suggest
        building positions in sub-sectorleaders and large companies that respond quickly to market changes.China

        and with improved business quality and market share, we see a bright outlook forHK-based Chinese securities

        Sunny Optical (2382HK): Industry leadership continues to strengthen on optical andoptoelectronic
        products<br/><br/>
        We think that as a leading camera module player the company will continue to benefit from the rapidincrease in
        dual camera penetration over the next few years. Also, its optical component segment islikely to maintain high
        revenue growth going forward given an improving handset lens sets productionstructure and exponential growth in
        the vehicle lens sets market. Considering that its opticalcomponent and optoelectronic segments continued to
        demonstrate relatively high growth during Jun-Sept 2017, we estimate 2017-2019EPS of Rmb2.35, 3.32and 4.56.<br/><br/>
        Yuhua Education (6169HK, NR): Timing of top-up placement gives advantage over peers foracquisitions<br/><br/>
        Yuhua Education announced a top-up share placement at a 10.4% discount to Thursday¡¯s closingprice. The proceeds
        will be used to prepare for potential acquisitions. The company is in activediscussions with a number of
        potential targets and aims to complete one or more acquisitions in thenext six months. We believe the successful
        placement indicates that institutional investors, especiallythose with long-term investment horizons, are
        positive on the education sector. With listed highereducation peers and companies that could soon be listed also
        looking for acquisition targets, Yuhua¡¯stiming to replenish funding could give it an advantage to land deals.
