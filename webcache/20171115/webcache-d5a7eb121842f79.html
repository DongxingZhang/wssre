    <p> We visited GCL-Poly premises in Xuzhou, noting progress in the firm¡¯s diamond wiresawretooling efforts. We
        maintain our EPS forecasts at Rmb0.12 in 17E (+7.9 YoY), revised upEPS forecast from Rmb0.12 to Rmb0.13 in 18E
        (+8.4% YoY), and from Rmb0.13 to Rmb0.15in 19E (+9.7% YoY). With relatively high wafer prices at present vs 1H17
        and ongoing costcontrols by the firm, we revise up our target price from HK$1.04 to HK$1.82. With 22%upside, we
        upgrade to BUY recommendation.<br/><br/>
        Retooling goes smoothly. GCL-Poly¡¯s polysilicon wafer capacity currently stands at 20GW,vs LONGi Green Energy
        Technology¡¯s (601012:CH - BUY) capacity of 12GW ofmonocrystalline silicon wafer. By end-June, just 30% of
        GCL-Poly¡¯s capacity had switchedto diamond wiresaw tech, although as of now, the percentage stands at c.70%. We
        believeby end-2017, the completion rate will top 80%. The technology reduces cutting time by afactor of c.3-5x
        and reduces silicon material wastage, with a cost saving of c.US$0.1/ps.<br/><br/>
        We expect non-silicon cost will decline by c.20% after the company completes the switchto diamond wiresaws,
        which we anticipate will happen by early 2018.<br/><br/>
        Polysilicon: larger market space, lower cost. Currently, GCL-Poly¡¯s polysilicon capacity isc.70,000t,
        representing c.17% of global capacity. Assuming that global annually installedsolar capacity will be 70GW for
        the following three years, we anticipate polysilicondemand of 350,000t per annum. With c.90% of wafer
        manufacturers located in China, webelieve annual demand for polysilicon in China will reach 315,000t. However,
        China¡¯sannual polysilicon capacity is only c.200,000t. The monthly polysilicon import was morethan 10,000t
        (17,628t in September). The current import dependence rate is more than60%. If the government adopts a stricter
        stance on polysilicon imports from Korea, whichaccounts for c.40% of China¡¯s total polysilicon imports, the
        potential market for domesticpolysilicon is very large. Furthermore, with GCL-Poly putting 40,000t of new
        polysiliconcapacity into operation in Xinjiang Province in 2018, we expect substantial cost savingsdue to low
        power costs in the region.<br/><br/>
        Policy motivated. On 8 November, the National Development &amp; Reform Commission(NDRC) released Guidelines on
        Reforming Pricing Mechanisms, calling for solar grid parityby end-2020, to be achieved by lowering solar
        tariffs. We see firms with low productioncosts, such as GCL-Poly, as positioned to benefit from the more
        challenging marketconditions for higher-cost peers.<br/><br/>
        Upgrade to BUY. We maintain our EPS forecast at Rmb0.12 in 17E (+7.9 YoY), revised upEPS forecast from Rmb0.12
        to Rmb0.13 in 18E (+8.4% YoY), and from 0.13 to Rmb0.15 in19E (+9.7% YoY). We revise up our target price from
        HK$1.04 to HK$1.82, representing 13x17E PE and 1.3x 17E PB, or 12x 18E PE and 1.2x 18E PB. With 22% upside, we
        upgradefrom Outperform to BUY rating.</p>
