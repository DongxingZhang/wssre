    <p> Private residential supply is expected to remain high in coming years<br/><br/>
        The Transport and Housing Bureau released their latest projection on privateprimary housing supply at about
        97,000units as of end-3Q17, where these unitsare expected to be available for sale in the coming 3-4years. While
        the latestprojection indeed declined by 1% QoQ from the last projection (at a record high of~98,000units as of
        mid-17) and represented the first QoQ decline since 4Q13, thelatest projection is still a high number in
        absolute terms and reaffirms our viewthat supply surplus will put downward pressure on residential prices ahead.<br/><br/>
        Unsold inventory increased to 9,000units by end-3Q17<br/><br/>
        The latest government residential supply projection of 97,000units available forsale in the next 3-4years
        comprises of 74,000units currently under construction(77,000units as of mid-17/ 2% above the 2-year average),
        31,000units pendingconstruction starts anytime (29,000units in mid-17/ 23% above the 2-yearaverage),
        9,000completed but unsold units (8,000units in mid-17/ 41% abovethe 2-year average), but excludes the
        17,000units already pre-sold (16,000unitsas of mid-17). On the other hand, 9,300units commenced construction
        (-51.3%YoY) and 12,900units reached completion (+20.6% YoY) in 9M17.<br/><br/>
        We expect the vacancy rate to surge to 9% by 2026, from 3.8% in 2016<br/><br/>
        We expect supply will likely increase materially from now onwards. We expectcompletion in the HK private housing
        market to average 19,330units/year during2017-26, 77% above the 10-year (2007-16) average of 10,926units.
        However,we project corresponding housing demand (net take-up) of merely 99,515unitsin 2017-26, implying a marked
        supply surplus of 93,781units. In our view, thiswould lead to a surge in vacancy rate to 9% by 2026(from 3.8% in
        2016) andresidential prices need to fall by 48% to restore the supply/demand equilibriumover this
        period.<br/><br/>
        Prefer developers to landlords; Buy CK Asset<br/><br/>
        We generally prefer developers to landlords on valuation. Our Buyrecommendation in the sector is CK Asset, as we
        believe it has a robust strategy,with the highest asset turnover among peers. Among developers, we have aSell
        rating on Henderson as we believe the ¡°Starter Homes¡± scheme will crowdout private demand for smaller units, and
        it will likely suffer the most with thelargest sales pipeline of small units. Our target prices are based on a
        sum-ofthe-parts approach. Key downside risks to our view include policy tighteningand unexpected economic
        fluctuations, key upside risks are policy and creditloosening.</p>
