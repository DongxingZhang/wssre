    <p> Investment Strategy: Investment ideas from China¡¯s push for better quality of life<br/><br/>
        During the 19th CPC National Congress, President Xi stated that China¡¯s new era will becharacterized by the
        competing forces of a push towards providing a better quality of life andcombating unbalanced and inadequate
        development. As China moves towards its aim of building awell-off society by 2020, we believe the push to
        provide a better quality of life will mean demandupgrades and improvements, at first particularly in
        environmental protection, healthcare, educationand telecommunication. We see supply-side constraint improvements
        and demand upgrades as thetwo key themes and Wisdom Education, BJE Water, Truly, CSPC Pharma, and Tencent as
        likelybeneficiaries.<br/><br/>

        1HFY18net profit rose 55% YoY, meaning earnings growth is on track towards our estimate of 34%in FY18(1H is the
        typical low season as it usually represents just 10-15% of FY net profit). Thelosses in HK &amp; Macau were
        contained, and its Japan &amp; US market saw revenue rise 31% YoY. Theproportion of revenue from China rose from
        45% in FY17to 46% in 1HFY18, while HK &amp; Macau¡¯sproportion decreased from 44% to 40%. We remain positive on
        2HFY18as SSS in HK &amp; Macau andChina turned positive in Sept, according to our channel checks, and 4QFY17will
        benefit from a lowbase due to the early CNY and warmer climate.<br/><br/>
