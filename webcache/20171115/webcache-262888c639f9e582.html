    <p> Geely Auto (175HK, Buy): Key takeaways from meeting with management; Considerablegrowth ahead<br/><br/>
        Management believes that given the considerable sales growth in 9M17(up 80% YoY), total salesvolume this year
        could reach 1.15-1.20m units, which would be higher than its previous sales target(1.1m units), while in line
        with our estimate of 1.19m units. This sales expectation would represent51-57% YoY sales growth, a significant
        growth rate among own-brand peers. The rapid sales growthcomes mainly from the company¡¯s balanced product mix,
        which focuses on both sedans and SUVs,its R&amp;D; which strives to make its products meet customers¡¯ needs, and
        its effective marketingstrategy. We expect 2018to be a key year for the company in terms of its products.
