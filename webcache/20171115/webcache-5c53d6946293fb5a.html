    <p> A-Share Market Color: Market focusing on stocks with cheap valuations and high earnings visibility<br/><br/>
        One of the mutual fund managers with a bullish view believes that the market will now focus on sectors with
        cheap valuations and high earnings visibility, and thinks it is a suitable strategy to select stocks from
        sectors with strong business conditions; they like baijiu, consumer electronics and manufacturing leaders.
        Another bullish fund manager prefers healthcare, consumer, insurance and import substitution. A PE fund manager
        with a neutral market view sees President Trump¡¯s visit to China and the upcoming Singles¡¯ day online shopping
        spree as positives.</p>
