    <p> Hyundai¡¯s domestic shipments rose 12.3% y-o-y to 53,012units in October despitefewer working days. Strong sales
        were driven by its key volume models, Sonata (up31.2% y-o-y), Grandeur (143.1% y-o-y) and newly launched Kona
        (3,819units). Welargely attribute this growth to a strong sales promotion through ¡®Korea Sale Festa¡¯ with~10%
        discounts on major models (Avante 5%, Sonata 7~10%, Santa Fe 5~7%). OverallRV sales rose 33.0% y-o-y, while PV
        sales were up 22.5% y-o-y. Kia¡¯s domestic salesvolume fell 6.3% y-o-y to 37,521units as both PVs (-13.2% y-o-y)
        and RVs (-7.9% y-o-y)struggled. In contrast to Kona, Kia¡¯s newly launched Stonic recorded weaker sales
        of1,089units. With the September-October data heavily distorted by the irregular timing oflunar holidays, we
        looked at the combined data for these two months; overall shipmentsfor HMC and Kia fell 0.2% and 1.9%,
        respectively, as overseas plants continued to postdisappointing results (-6.5% y-o-y for HMC and -12.3% y-o-y
        for Kia).<br/><br/>
        Recovery not expected under current product cycle without incentive spending:Both Hyundai and Kia reported tepid
        overseas shipments, down 6.5% y-o-y and11.2% y-o-y, respectively. We continue to believe it is unlikely that HMC
        and Kia willsee a meaningful turnaround under the current product cycle without an incentivespending hike given
        the improved product competitiveness of its major competitors(e.g. Toyota) in key markets. For the US, we
        continue to expect a rise in incentivespending and margin contraction until we see new model launches with
        powertrainupgrades. HMC recently introduced a new Assurance program, including a ¡°3-dayMoney Back Guarantee.¡±;
        we think there could be an increase in the cost burdenunder SG&amp;A; that might hurt its profitability in
        2018e. For China, there was a gradualrecovery in September-October but we think this was led by increased
        capacity inChina as HMC¡¯s fifth plant started production in September. We are also increasinglyconcerned about
        utilisation risks, given 1) its similar pricing to Japanese peers; 2)consumer preference shift to local brands
        (local brands¡¯ pricing is at least 20-30%lower than HMC¡¯s); and 3) a lack of product diversification. We think a
        full recovery isonly possible with further pricing discounts.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Hold on HMC and Kia: We maintain Hold ratings on both HMC and Kiawith unchanged target prices of
        KRW139,000and KRW36,000, respectively. Wecontinue to believe their fundamentals are not likely to improve
        meaningfully underthe current product cycle given a lack of product competitiveness.</p>
