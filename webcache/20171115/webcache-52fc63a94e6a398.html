    <p> Global oil prices (Brent) are currently hovering around 64Dollar per barrel, whichis about a 16-17% increase
        from mid-September¡¯17. The key question now iswhether one should consider USD65/barrel as the new normal for
        global oil pricesor a lower/higher average? While this is not easy to answer as the sustainabilityof global oil
        prices around current levels or higher would depend on a host of geopoliticalfactors and influenced by the
        growth outlook of countries such as China,risks have clearly increased as far as India¡¯s macro is
        concerned.¡£<br/><br/>
        India has been a key beneficiary of lower oil prices in the last few years, whichhas helped improve the
        country¡¯s fiscal and current account balances and alsomade it easier for the RBI to achieve its inflation target
        so far. It is indeedcomforting to note that India¡¯s growth, while on a recovery mode, continues tooutperform
        most major EM peers, inflation remains contained around the 4%mark, fiscal consolidation/ tax reforms are
        underway and Balance of Paymentsposition remain considerably strong at this juncture. But, has India managed
        tobuild sufficient buffers to deal with a rebound in the price of commodities? Dopublic finances have the
        capacity of absorbing an oil shock (unlike the past)?Are inflation expectations well anchored, allowing the RBI
        to look past a likely¡°temporary¡± commodity-induced jump in inflation?<br/><br/>
        To answer these questions, we undertake a scenario analysis for India, tryingto analyze the impact on key macro
        indicators if global oil prices were to settlearound USD65/barrel through the next financial year. We compare
        this with ourbaseline forecasts to understand whether and to what extent stress could emergeas a consequence of
        potential higher than anticipated oil prices and consequentpolicy implications.¡£</p>
