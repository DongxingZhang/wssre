        Retail transition paying off. We believe the bank¡¯s lagging valuation and share performance ismainly due to
        investors¡¯ concern about its heavy reliance on corporate business. However, we believeCITIC Bank¡¯s retail
        transition has started to pay off. In terms of asset structure, its loan exposure toriskier industries like
        manufacturing, mining, and wholesale/retail declined from 27% in 2015 and22% in 2016 to 18% in 1H17 (vs sector
        average of 26%). Its retail loan ratio increased from 26% in2015 and 33% in 2016 to 37% in 1H17 (vs sector
        average of 33%). Its deposit-to-total liabilities ratioremained stable at 66% in 1H17 (vs sector average of
        64%). Its exposure to interbank liabilitiesdeclined from 23% in 2015 and 21% in 2016 to 19% in 1H17 (vs sector
        average of 22%). With a lowbase and its continuous promotion of retail business, we see further improvement in
        fundamentals aslikely, and expect valuation recovery.<br/><br/>
        Chasing laggard. Looking forward into 4Q17, the tightening loan quota and strengthening propertyregulation will
        lead to a rising funding cost for the real economy, resulting in further downwardpressure on property sales and
        property investment, as well as related manufacturing investment andconsumption growth. Disappointing property
        sales during the peak season in September and Octoberwould lead to rising market concerns about economic growth.
        As a result, we expect a relievingpolicy overhang, leading to valuation recovery in the banking sector. The
        targeted reserverequirement ratio (RRR) cut indicates that interbank liquidity will gradually improve in
        comingmonths. CITIC Bank may benefit more in terms of NIM given its relatively higher reliance oninterbank
        liabilities, as well as its larger valuation discount. The stock only rallied by 9% YTD, (vs23% for the sector
        and 21% for the HSCEI). It is only trading at of 0.50x 17E PB, vs a sector averagelevel of 0.73x. The H-share is
        trading at a 33% discount to the A-share, vs a sector average discountof 19%.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Outperform. We maintain our EPS forecasts of Rmb0.89 in 17E (+5% YoY), Rmb0.97in 18E (+9% YoY), and
        Rmb1.07 in 19E (+10% YoY). We lower our target price from HK$6.09to HK$6.03, representing 0.55x 18E PB. With 19%
        upside, we maintain our Outperform rating.</p>
