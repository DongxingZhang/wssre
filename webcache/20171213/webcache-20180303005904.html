    <p> Throughout most of 2017 South Korea¡¯s market-based measures of sovereign credit riskrose, its 5-yr EDF (Expected
        Default Frequency) metric peaking on October 31 at 0.30%,the country's highest reading since 2013, from a low of
        0.10% on January 2. 1 Most of theworry generating the risk metric was in response to the growing international
        conflict overNorth Korea¡¯s development of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles to deliver themonto faraway
        targets.<br/><br/>
        After November 7 the EDF metric dropped steadily through last week to a low of 0.23%on November 28. This
        corresponded with a lull in any particularly alarming news about theNorth Korean weapons or threat of
        hostilities about them.<br/><br/>
        On November 29 North Korea announced the successful test of a new missile that theregime claimed could reach all
        of the US with a heavy warhead (a claim neutral expertsthought might be realistic). And on November 29 the South
        Korean sovereign EDF startedto go up again, though not precipitously. Over the next few days it oscillated up
        and downslightly.<br/><br/>
        The 5-yr CDS spread, one of the drivers of the EDF metric, followed the pattern of the EDF in2017, though with a
        more spikey path, especially on the upside. It began the year at 46 bp,reached its high to date of 76 bp on
        September 28, and paralleled the EDF drop to 59 bp onNovember 29.<br/><br/>
        South Korea¡¯s five-year sovereign EDF metric can be converted to a market-implied rating.<br/><br/>
        This implied rating was A1 in January and steadily dropped during 2017, in tandem with therise of the EDF. From
        Labor Day to Thanksgiving, September 4 to November 23, it was mainlyBaa2, its lowest of the year. Since November
        24 it has been up, at Baa1, well in respectableinvestment grade territory. Moody¡¯s Investors Service¡¯s rating
        for South Korea has been Aa2all year.</p>
