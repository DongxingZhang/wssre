    <p> Updated weekly results suggest speculators have reduced the positions in basemetals across the board. Overbought
        levels remain for aluminium and zinc.<br/><br/>
        Overall, BNP Paribas base metals positioning score is at 6.5 (out of 10), down from7.6 forty days ago.
        Adjustment might not be over, though.<br/><br/>
        Nickel and copper scores are at neutral camp now. The highlight of the week is thedrop in copper
        inventories.<br/><br/>
        Speculative positions in energy (measured as the net money manager allocationadjusted by the amount of open
        interest) are stretched.<br/><br/>
        Same as last week, the difference between the DOE crude oil total inventory (exstrategicreserves) and the
        12-month moving average is the smallest since 2011:this has been a resilient, supporting factor for market
        prices, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Deliverable stocks in Shanghai are at the lows for nickel. Copper stocks haverebounded (bottom reached in Q3
        2017). Aluminium is the only metal with stable,positive stocks in Shanghai.<br/><br/>
        Market correction over the last weeks has been in line with the positioning scores.</p>
