    <p> November M2 YoY growth beat expectations. The 9.1% YoY growth of M2 beat expectations in November 2017
        andincreased MoM. The disparity between M2 YoY growth and M1 YoY growth continued to contract MoM. We think the
        MoMincrease in M2 YoY growth was mainly due to the lower base effect and credit and loan expansion. Considering
        the lowerbase effect, we expect YoY growth of M2 to recover mildly in December 2017.<br/><br/>
        New RMB significantly increased both MoM and YoY in November. The 12.7% YoY decrease in new TSF inNovember 2017
        was driven by the decrease in new entrusted loans, new trust loans, new undiscounted bills, and newcorporate
        bonds. New RMB loans significantly increased MoM and YoY, which showed that the demand for funds of realeconomy
        was still strong and the economy was still resilient. Medium-term and long-term RMB loans increased by 9.6%YoY
        and 39.1% MoM, respectively. Of which, personal medium-term and long-term RMB loans decreased by 26.6% YoYand
        increased by 12.6% MoM; non-financial corporate medium-term and long-term RMB loans increased by 111.8 % YoYand
        80.7% MoM, respectively. The YoY decrease in personal medium-term and long-term RMB loans shows thatresidential
        demand has possibly been mitigated given the government's stringent property market regulations, but theYoY and
        MoM increase in non-financial corporate medium-term and long-term RMB loans implies that the demand forfunds of
        real economy was still strong. The proportion of new RMB loans to real economy in new TSF was 71.3% inNovember
        2017.<br/><br/>
        Our views on liquidity: In November 2017, the PBOC extended RMB 24.2 bn in loans via standing lending facility,
        RMB404.0 bn in loans via medium-term lending facility and RMB 46.8 bn in loans via pledged supplementary
        lending. The CPIfor November 2017 was 1.7%. In the ¡°China Monetary Policy Report, The Third Quarter 2017¡±, the
        PBOC expressed thatfocusing on the three tasks of serving real economy, preventing and controlling financial
        risks, and deepening financialreforms, it would continue to adopt prudent and neutral monetary policies to
        create a neutral and moderate monetary andfinancial environment for supply-side reform and high quality
        development. Under the background that the economy isprojected to stabilize, in order to control economic
        exposure, keep the RMB foreign exchange rate stable and controlcapital outflow given the U.S. Fed¡¯s interest
        rate hike and shrinkage of balance sheet, we expect that the PBOC willmaintain prudent and neutral monetary
        policies and China¡¯s liquidity conditions will remain slightly tight in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Sector views: We expect that earnings recovery and asset quality improvement of mainland Chinese banks will
        boosttheir valuations. We maintain ¡°Outperform¡± rating for the banking sector. Our top pick is BOCHK (02388 HK);
        our rating is"Buy" and TP for the Company is HKD47.52.</p>
