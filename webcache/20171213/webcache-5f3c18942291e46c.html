    <p> Growth Continues into 2018 ¡ª Strong recovery in trade and exports since Nov2016 propelled Singapore¡¯s 2017E GDP
        to +3.2% growth (vs. +2.5% estimatedearlier) and looks set to continue, with growth of +3.3% 2018. With
        historicalrecovery bouts spanning 24 to 48 months, we begin the task of watching cyclicalindicators for peak
        comps. Investors likely begin factoring tougher YoY comparisonsinto 1H18. Peaking of cyclical indicators, i.e.,
        container and exports throughput,have led STI peaks historically by 6 to 24 months.<br/><br/>
        First year with &gt; 20% return since 2012. What about 2018? Singapore was thebest performer in ASEAN YTD,
        rising +28% in USD terms, ahead of Thailand(+21%), Phils (+19%), Malaysia (+15%) and Indonesia (+12%). 2017 did
        indeedturn out as a chart bottom, similar to 2001 and 2009 when Singapore recoveredfrom weak economic cycles.
        Singapore¡¯s STI Index returned +28% YTD 2017 withthe year¡¯s aggregate EPS growing +6%, cementing the first year
        with returns &gt;20%, accompanied by meaningful growth in corporate profits. 2018 STI bottom-upindex target
        3,672 (implied PER of 16.7x) is 7% higher from current levels, driven bymeaningful upsides from stocks such as
        Singtel, OCBC and DBS. With the secondyear of recovery after deep market downturns being more modest
        historically, ourcast of 2018 picks include DBS, GENS, CCT, SATS, STE and ComfortDelgro. Ourtop sells include
        SMM and SPH.<br/><br/>
        Balancing Capex vs. Disruption ¡ª Singapore¡¯s largest challenge remainsremaking profit centres as countries and
        companies adjust to China¡¯s expansioninternationally and as digital and disruptive challengers mount. While a
        recovery incapex (post a 5-year hiatus since 2013) would help telegraph continued growthexpectations into 2018,
        digital and disruptive challengers are likely to present biggerthreats. While we count DBS and SATS as two firms
        that have successfully grafteddigital practices into their respective enterprises, we would expect more ¡°old
        empire¡±firms to partner startups and adopt technology as new means for renewal andgrowth. STE is well positioned
        as a supplier of tech to help old empire firms withdigital knobs to drive future growth.<br/><br/>
        Risks ¡ª While pressures in offshore marine have abated with stabilizing oil prices,weak interest cover in the
        segment and ongoing restructurings continue to cast risk.<br/><br/>
        While the prospects of (marginally) higher interest rates would be cheered by banksand savers, leveraged
        investors in income and yield products could groan. Trump¡¯sproposal to remake US taxation is an important
        liquidity watch point, given themeaningful presence of US corporates and their treasury units in Singapore.</p>
