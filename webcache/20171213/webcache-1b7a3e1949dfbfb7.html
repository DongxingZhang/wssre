    <p> Summary<br/><br/>
        Technical conditions remain supportive for EM credit markets anchored by continuous inflows and demand for EM
        yields, despite again high volumes of supplies expected in early 2018. We forecast USD58bn net issuances by EM
        sovereign issuers in 2018 (gross: USD145bn, repayments USD87bn), significantly lower than 2016 levels (USD97bn).
        With US rates likely on the rise, we expect issuances to be front-loaded (likely concentrated during Jan-Apr).
        Investor¡¯s positioning has reduced to neutral in November, with funds preserving their profits before year-end.
        This - in conjunction with high repayment in January - bodes well for the technical conditions at the onset of
        2018.<br/><br/>
        Net supply will reduce to USD58bn in 2018 from record USD97bn in 2017<br/><br/>
        We forecast gross issuance of USD145bn by EM sovereign issuers in 2018, but much reduced from the record
        USD180bn in 2017 (YTD). With total repayments of USD87bn in 2018, the net supply is set to decrease from USD97bn
        in 2017 to USD58bn in 2018. With the expected tightening and eventual recovery of term premium, we expect
        sovereign issuances to be front-loaded (likely concentrated in Jan-Apr). Historically, around 45% of issuances
        have come to the primary market during Jan-Apr (second chart on right), while 20% in May-Aug and 35% in Sep-Dec.
        In 2018, the issuance pattern may be further skewed towards the first half of the year thanks to the US rates
        scenarios.<br/><br/>
        In November, Argentina, Croatia, Nigeria and Pakistan, among others issued in total about USD12bn of external
        debt. Recently, in the first week of December, Indonesia sold USD4bn bonds in three tranches. Overall YTD, EMEA
        has been the highest issuer of sovereign debt with USD118bn (66%), followed by LatAm USD41bn (23%), and
        AsiaUSD21bn (12%). Notably, the issuances from GCC countries (28% of total) have seen a sudden surge since 2016
        (see chart on the next page). The regional distribution issuance is likely to remain similar in 2018. In terms
        of upcoming bonds pipeline, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Kenya, among others are expected to come to the primary
        market in early 2018.<br/><br/>
        We expect inflows to continue in 2018, albeit at a slower pace than 2017<br/><br/>
        In 2017 year-to-date, EM hard currency funds took in USD39bn (23%AUM), as compared to USD16bn (15%AUM) for EM
        local currency funds and USD 8bn (16%AUM) for EM blended currency funds, according to EPFR reports. With fund
        managers preserving gains, the pace of flows in hard currency funds have moderated towards the year-end
        (USD1.5bn, 0.8%AUM in Nov). We expect ¡®hunt for yield¡¯ will continue to attract inflows in 2018, albeit at
        slower pace than 2017.<br/><br/>
        Mutual fund beta closer to 1 (market-weight)<br/><br/>
        Our mutual fund beta measure has now moved down to 1 from 1.1 in mid- November, suggesting that funds have moved
        closer to the benchmark entering into the year-end. In November, only 40% of the top 20 funds by size
        outperformed their benchmarks as compared to 65% in 3Q17, and 55% YTD.<br/><br/>
        Benchmarked investors positioning overview<br/><br/>
        As of the end of October, EM benchmarked (EMBI-G and EMBI div) investors remained most overweight in Argentina,
        Brazil, Ukraine, and Peru, whilst they were underweight Philippines, Poland, Hungary, Colombia, and South
        Africa, among others. However, we note this data (based on EPFR monthly country weight report) has almost one
        month lag (see positioning charts on page 5).</p>
