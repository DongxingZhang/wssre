        Albumin: weak performances from domestic players and MNCs<br/><br/>
        We highlight that the industry growth trend reversed and most of the majorplayers experienced a decline in
        albumin approval volume in 3Q17. Baxalta,Grifols, Octapharma, Hualan and CBPO declined 22%, 7%, 2%, 5% and 42%
        YoYin 3Q17, vs. 80%, 30%, 16%, 36% and 4% growth in 1H17. Albumin approvalvolume of CSL was flat in 3Q17, vs.
        33% growth in 1H17. In contrast, RAAScontinued to deliver growth of 11% YoY in 3Q17, vs. 119% in 1H17. We
        attributethe growth divergence to volatilities in custom releases, the approval timeline andtiming of plasma
        collection/fractionation.<br/><br/>
        IVIG approvals dropped in 3Q17<br/><br/>
        Overall industry growth turned negative to -16% YoY in 3Q17vs. 20%/24% in1H17/2016. Market leaders Hualan and
        CBPO recorded 15% and 40% declines,respectively, in 3Q17vs. 48% and 43% growth in 1H17. Growth of RAASand CNBG
        changed to 28% and -77%, respectively, in 3Q17, from -11% and30% in 1H17, mainly due to volatile approval data
        and fierce competition. Onmarket dynamics, the market shares of both CBPO and Hualan expanded 1% inYTD9m17. We
        remind investors that approval data have a strong correlation withreported sales data for all listed names.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining price targets for CBPO and Hualan<br/><br/>
        We base our price target of USD130for CBPO on 23.5x 2018E EPS. We believethat CBPO deserves a valuation premium
        over other pharmaceutical peers givenits long-term growth prospects and strong risk profile amid sector
        headwinds.For CBPO, key downside risks include M&amp;A; integration, price erosion, disruptionin plasma
        collection, cost inflation and delays in product launches. Our pricetarget of RMB26for Hualan is based on 28x
        2018E EPS. For Hualan, upsiderisks include smaller-than-expected ASP cuts, while downside risks include
        costinflation/ higher-than-expected ASP cuts.</p>
