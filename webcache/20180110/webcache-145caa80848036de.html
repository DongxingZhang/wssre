    <p> 2017has been one of ※the good year§ for Indonesian financial asset markets, signifiedby 20% gains in the stock
        market, 10Y Indonesian government bond (proxy for sovereignbond market) yield declined 165.4bps, and the rupiah
        (IDR) remained largely stable with just0.7% depreciation against the USD for the entire of last year, similar to
        that of the Philippinespeso (PHP). Such stellar performance was inevitably attributed to a more resilient
        economyand more sound policies as well as better synergy amongst key policymakers in shaping uppolicy
        formulations and ensuring its actual implementation.?<br/><br/>
        Notable improvements in some areas were acknowledged and gave quite a comfort boostof confidence into the
        prospects of the Indonesian economy for this year and onwards. Theimprovements include: Higher FDI inflows
        (Macro Note 每 Indonesia: Investment RealizationContinue To Grow In Q32017), stable inflation and within official
        target (Macro Note 每Indonesia: Inflation Slowed In November, Likely To End This Year Within the Lower
        OfficialRange), narrowing current account deficit (Macro Note: Indonesia: Current Account DeficitContinue To
        Narrow In Q32017), higher exports receipt (Macro Note 每 Indonesia: ExportsHigher In October But Trade Surplus
        Narrowed), and stronger international reserves (MacroNote 每 Indonesia Foreign Reserves Fell From Record High).
        Reflecting such improvements,the World Bank increases Indonesia＊s rank in its flagship indicator of Ease of
        Doing Businessby 19places, up to 72nd position from 91st previously (Macro Note 每 Indonesia: Ease OfDoing
        Business Ranking Improved). The most noticeable accolade came from Fitch＊s earlyChristmas present for Indonesia
        in 2017, by upgrading Indonesia＊s investment grade a notchhigher to BBB from BBB每 (Macro Note 每 Indonesia: Fitch
        Upgraded Indonesia to BBB).?<br/><br/>
        However, the economy has also face some challenges from both the domestic and externalfronts, with slowing
        household consumption and possible fiscal shortfalls (Macro Note 每Indonesia: Q3GDP Growth Accelerated Tad Higher
        and Macro Note 每 Indonesia: 2018Fiscal Outlook 每 What To Watch Out For) as well as potential capital reversal
        risks (MacroNote 每 Indonesia: Portfolio Capital Flows Ahead Of Fed＊s 2018Rate Outlook) as key factorsthat
        global, regional, and domestic investors were constantly be concerned of. We expectthis will continue to be the
        focus in 2018.?<br/><br/>
        For this year, on the economic front, UOBI forecast GDP to grow at 5.3% for 2018,an improvement from a likely
        5.1% growth for 2017. Regional elections, Asian games,and continuous infrastructure spending are the key driving
        factors for growth to edge higherthis year, also aided by better-looking global economic prospects with the IMF
        for the firsttime upgrading its global GDP growth since the global credit crisis took place that sawconsistent
        downward revision ever since. For 2018, the IMF forecast a 3.7% global GDPgrowth (compared to 3.6% for 2017and
        higher than its July＊s forecast of 3.6% initially for2018global GDP growth). Indonesian consumer confidence also
        remains relatively guardeddespite cautiously so in 2017and likely to remain so for 2018(Macro Note 每
