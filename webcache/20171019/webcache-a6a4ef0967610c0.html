    <p> Key monthly trends:<br/><br/>
        Both system loans and deposits were largely flat in August 2017, posting theweakest monthly trend so far this
        year.<br/><br/>
        System loans were flat in August 2017up 0.2% MoM (+12% YTD), mainlysupported by loans in HK, up 0.2% MoM (+11%
        YTD), while offshore loanswere flat (0.3% MoM, +12.5% YTD), as also was total trade finance (-0.1%MoM, +9% YTD).
        Currency wise, HKD loans grew 0.7% MoM (+12% YTD)and FX lending dropped slightly (-0.3% MoM, +11%
        YTD).<br/><br/>
        System deposits were also flat with a slight drop in August (-0.2% MoM,+6.4% YTD), as HKD deposits fell 0.7% MoM
        (+10.5% YTD), and FXdeposits grew 0.3% (+2.5% YTD). The CASA ratio was stable at 58% (July:58%). Overall system
        LDR was stable at 71.7% with HKD LDR at 78%(July: 77%, December 2016: 68%) and FX LDR at 65% (July
        65%).<br/><br/>
        RMB deposits fell 0.4% MoM (-2.6% YTD). RMB time deposits fell by 1%MoM (-5.6% YTD), offset by RMB savings
        deposits growing 1.5% MoM(+6.6% YTD), with the proportion in time deposit funding dropping to 73%(peak: 85% in
        September 2014). Offshore RMB deposits now account foronly 5% (5.1% in July) of the system total (peak: 12.8% in
        March 2014).<br/><br/>
        The residential mortgage survey showed outstanding mortgage loansrising 0.5% (+5.3% YTD); mortgage approvals
        dropped 11% MoM, andloan drawdowns fell 13% MoM. New loans priced with reference to HIBORfell slightly to 95.4%
        (July: 95.9%).<br/><br/>
        The composite interest rate decreased by 1bp MoM to 0.30% at Augustend(July: 0.31%). Our deposit cost check with
        sample HK banks inSeptember 2017showed both HKD and RMB deposit rates rose slightlyMoM for all tenors but are
        still off from this year¡¯s high level in June.<br/><br/>
        Short rates largely remained steady during the quarter until recently¡­<br/><br/>
        During 3Q17, the average 1M/3M HIBOR were 45bp and 76bp (-2/-13bp vs.averages in 1H17), which has continued to
        widen vs. 1M/3M USD LIBORduring the quarter, now by 79bp/55bp (Figure 1). To soak up excessive liquidityin the
        system, the HKMA announced HKD40bn additional issuances ofExchange fund bills in mid-September; the 1M HIBOR has
        reacted by steadilyrising to 58bp; it has widened by 11bp since the announcement (Figure 2).Though the
        sustainability of such should support margin, history shows littlepositive correlation between 1M HIBOR and HK
        banks¡¯ share prices.<br/><br/>
        Already pricing in key positive trends; unattractive valuations<br/><br/>
        The sector currently trades at 15x P/E, 1.8x P/B and 2018E 12% RoE, whichdoes not look attractive to us and
        already prices in the potential benefits of ratehikes. Post reporting 1H17results in late August, the best
        performer in thesector in September was HSB (+6%), the worst performer was DSF (-6%); inthe first eight months
        in 2017, the best performer was BOCHK (+44%), and theworst was DSF (+8%). Within HK banks, we retain our Sell
        calls on BoCHK andBEA while DSB and DSF remain Buys, resting on undemanding valuations ¨C0.9x/0.8x P/B and10x/ 9x
        P/E and 9.5%/9% 2018E RoE. Our TPs areGGM/SOTP-based. Downside risks: 1) severe property price correction;
        2)significant asset quality deterioration. Upside risk: significant earningsimprovement on rate hikes.</p>
