        Volkswagen (VW) plans to secure LT supply of cobalt, a vital component forrechargeable batteries in Electric
        Vehicles (EV). VW intends to invest $24bn inzero-emission vehicles by 2030 and has asked producers to submit
        proposalsby YE17 for supplying cobalt up to 10-years. Company plans to make 3mEV¡¯s/pa and roll out 80 new models
        (vs. prior goal of 30) by 2025, for which itwill require 150GWh of battery capacity yearly. Battery chemistry
        will initiallybe 6:2:2 (Ni:Co:Mn), but may switch to 8:1:1 later. Industry sources said tenderwording suggested
        it may have been circulated to lithium and chemicalproducers too. Assuming 8-12 kg of cobalt in a battery, 3m
        EV¡¯s equates to$1.6-2.4bn of cobalt at spot price ($27/lb). (Mining Weekly)Hangang steel mill in China¡¯s Handan
        city, Hebei to reduce output from 10/1,45 days prior to government directive of 50% utilization cut from Nov
        15-March 15. Although exact time-frame of the cut or amount of output lost wasnot revealed, a local trader said
        company may idle 3 furnaces from Oct 1 toearly-2018, translating to 20kt/day (vs. total capacity of 37kt/d or
        13mt/pa).<br/><br/>
        This is the second city to announce winter output cut plans, after Xingtai.<br/><br/>
        Tangshan, the largest steelmaking city in Hebei is yet to release details. (SBB)US steel output falls 1.4% WoW
        to 1.72m st (+8.1% YoY), with utilization at73.8% (-110bps WoW, +580 bps YoY) for week ending 9/23. YTD
        outputtotaled 66m st (+3.6% YoY), with utilization at 74.6% (+250 bps YoY). (AISI)Goldcorp reports progress
        towards 5-year target of increasing production andreserves by 20% and decreasing AISC by 20%. Operational
        improvements(3,000t/day output), sustainable cost savings ($25m in 2017) and explorationsuccess achieved at
        Cerro Negro. Pyrite Leach project in Penasquito ($420mcapex) is 3-months ahead of schedule and under budget,
        with 40% completedand 4Q18 expected commissioning. PFS of Century Base Case and NuevaUnion JV nearing completion
        (4Q17 &amp; 1Q18), respectively. Cerro Casale JVcommences exploration program. Musselwhite expansion 48%
        complete andon time (1Q19 completion) and on budget ($90m). (Company)US Steel and Kobe Steel to construct new
        Continuous Galvanizing Line (CGL)at their JV, PRO-TEC Coating, in Ohio, in response to increased demand
        foradvanced high-strength steels. The new CGL (capacity: 500kt/pa, $400mcapex) will produce hot-dip zinc coated
        Gen3 steels for automobiles.<br/><br/>
        Construction is to begin in 4Q17 and startup in 2019. (Company)</p>
