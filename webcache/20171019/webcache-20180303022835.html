    <p> Don't underestimate Haitang Bay's duty-free sales growth in 2H17<br/><br/>
        We recently talked to travel agencies and hotel managers in Haitang Bay in Sanya.According to their feedback,
        traffic growth in Haitang Bay was robust from Julyto September. We estimate duty-free sales in Haitang Bay could
        reach as highas 50-60% from July to September. While the market seems to be expecting1) potential bidding for
        duty-free businesses at Shanghai Pudong Airport and2) approval for a downtown duty-free business in Beijing, we
        believe CITS'sHaitang Bay duty-free sales may surprise to the upside in 2H17as domestic travelmomentum to Sanya
        is strong. In view of the national holiday (golden week),we expect October duty-free sales to maintain strong
        momentum. We slightlyrevise up our revenue/earnings forecasts by 4%/1% for 2017and 6%/7% for 2018to reflect the
        better-than-expected Haitang Bay duty-free sales. Consequently, welift our target price to RMB40, from
        RMB37previously.<br/><br/>
        The new Atlantis Sanya Resort should attract more overnight consumers toshop in the Haitang Bay duty-free
        mall<br/><br/>
        In the longer term, we believe the strong momentum of Haitang Bay's duty-freesales growth will prevail. The
        world's third Atlantis Hotel Resort is scheduled toopen at the beginning of 2018. Atlantis Resort is not only a
        luxury hotel but alsoa water park, located only 2km from the Haitang Bay duty-free shopping mall.We expect
        Atlantis to attract an incremental 2-3million tourists to the HaitangBay area; we believe Atlantis'
        entertainment facilities should encourage tourists tostay overnight and these tourists will likely be the key
        traffic driver for the HaitangBay duty-free shopping mall.<br/><br/>
        National holiday kicks off with a strong start; Haitang Bay shopping mall sees19.2% visitor growth on first
        day<br/><br/>
        According to Sanya tourism statistics, the total number of visitors to the HaitangBay duty-free shopping mall on
        the first day of the national holiday was 11,951,representing growth of 19.2% yoy vs. only 10k visitors last
        year (-12% yoy). Hoteloccupancy in the Haitang Bay area also reflects this recovery. The occupancy rateof
        Haitang Bay hotels is 75%, with an ADR of RMB1,010, representing a rise of15.4%. These data points underpin our
        view that this should be a year of robustdomestic travel growth, and Sanya is the best proxy for such a
        recovery.<br/><br/>
        Catalyst ahead? CITS keeps winning new key airports. What's left?<br/><br/>

        (concessionaire rate of 35%) at Guangzhou BaiyunIntl Airport. To recap, CITS won the bidding for inbound duty
        free with a 42%</p>
