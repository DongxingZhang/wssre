    <p> Industry read-across on environmental sanitation; Buy China Everbright Intl<br/><br/>
        We had a meeting with management of Tus-Sound Environmental (000826CH,not rated), a major environmental company
        in China involved in environmentalsanitation and waste and water treatment etc. Beijing Enterprises Water
        (371HK;<br/><br/>
        BEW) and China Everbright Intl (257HK; CEI) have been expanding in this area andBEW may do a spin-off listing of
        this business in 2018, according to E20news.Key industry read-across includes: market opportunities are likely
        to grow as theChinese government accelerates privatization, project IRRs are higher than waterprojects as result
        of there being little capex involved, potential add-on businessincluding waste transfer station management can
        further boost project returns.Our preferred Buy is CEI, which we like in light of its improving earnings
        qualityfrom operations, decent growth profile, and undemanding valuation.<br/><br/>
        Project awards likely to grow further<br/><br/>
        Environmental sanitation is an emerging business for the listcos as the Chinesegovernment has just started to
        privatize over the past few years. During the earlieryears, most contracts were awarded through open bidding and
        those contractsusually lasted between 3to 8years. However, there have been some contractsrecently which last for
        as long as 20years. Most of the sanitation contractswere awarded through open bidding. Management expect
        privatization (projectaward) of environmental sanitation to accelerate over the next few years and Tus-Sound
        does not see competition as being particularly fierce, presumably becauseof the large amount of opportunities in
        the market. Management sees a lot ofurban-rural integrated projects for environmental sanitation as there is a
        largeamount of waste in rural areas which has not been properly collected at this stage.SOEs have a strong
        competitive advantage in this area as result of their stronggovernment relationship.</p>
