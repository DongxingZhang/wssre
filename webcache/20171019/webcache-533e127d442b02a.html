    <p> We are revising down our 2018 forecast for Brazil¡¯s headline inflation rate to 3.5% from 4.0%.<br/><br/>
        Consensus has been steadily moving towards our forecast (Chart 1). But now we have widenedthe distance owing to
        contained increases in regulated and services prices combined with a mildrecovery in prices for food. While we
        love becoming consensus, we hate being consensus.<br/><br/>
        We have been well ahead of the crowd in forecasting that inflation would fall quickly in 2017. InMay 2016, at
        the time of Brazil¡¯s change in government, we argued that inflation expectationswould be re-anchored by a mix of
        central bank¡¯s regained credibility, a stronger currency andthe worst recession in Brazil¡¯s recorded history
        with the effect of pulling inflation down to targetin 2017 (please see Brazil: And now for something completely
        different, dated 5 May 2016).<br/><br/>
        Despite some scepticism expressed at the time, our inflation story has played out. In fact,inflation actually
        surprised us to the downside and looks set to finish this year at 3.0%.<br/><br/>
        We believe service price inflation is set to continue falling, becoming an important driver of nextyear¡¯s
        sub-4.0% IPCA inflation, despite expected growth acceleration in 2018 (we forecast GDPto grow by 3.0%). We are
        forecasting overall services inflation to fall to 3.8% in 2018 from thisyear¡¯s 4.7% (Chart 2). Breaking down
        services inflation into three main components (Chart 3),we project that while price inflation might start to
        accelerate for food outside the home andairfares (pushed up by higher food prices), inflation should continue on
        a downward trend forlabour-intensive and other price services based one a still below potential growth and
        inertia.<br/><br/>
        The Brazilian economy is now on an uptrend, recovering from an accumulated drop of almost10% in recent years.
        After eight quarters of quarterly contraction, Brazil has already faced twoof growth and should remain on
        positive terrain for some time. Still, the economy is running farbelow potential and we expect it will need many
        quarters to return to its potential rate. As aresult, we do not expect activity to put pressure on inflation in
        2018.<br/><br/>
        The argument of inertia in prices usually shows up when inflation is high; both formal (eg, theminimum wage) and
        informal (eg, rental and overall wage negotiation) inertia mechanisms werecreated in Brazil in response to
        periods of very high inflation. We believe inertia, which centralbankers usually find bothersome during
        disinflationary periods, should help inflation in 2018,given the starting point for next year¡¯s inflation.</p>
