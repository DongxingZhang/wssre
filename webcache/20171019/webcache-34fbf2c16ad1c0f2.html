    <p> IA new orders +14% in 3Q, much stronger than market expected<br/><br/>
        Preliminary datapoints from Gongkong show that China's IA new order growthfurther accelerated in 3Q (+14% YoY
        vs. +11%/12% in 1Q/2Q). The marketpreviously had anticipated that on a higher base, the growth would taper
        offprobably towards the high-single digit level. Our conversations with Gongkongsuggest the final growth rate
        may come even higher and such strong growthwas largely driven by better-than-expected demand from
        small-to-medium-sizeenterprises (SMEs) as they are increasingly willing to invest in automationupgrades to
        strengthen their competitiveness against the backdrop of improvingprofitability. Strong government support also
        helped to accelerate this trend, inour view.<br/><br/>
        Hollysys and Inovance may deliver better-than-expected order growth in 3Q<br/><br/>
        For servo and low-voltage inverter (Inovance's key products), YoY growth rates(preliminary data) for new orders
        further accelerated to 30%+ and c.15%respectively in 3Q, from 14%/27% and 11%/10% respectively in 1Q/2Q.
        This,along with accelerating import substitutions, may drive stronger-than-expected IAnew order growth for
        Inovance in 3Q. For DCS (Hollysys' key product), preliminarynew order growth further ticked up to 7% from 5% in
        1H. Hollysys managedto deliver 36% IA new order growth in FY17against flattish industry growth.Continued market
        recovery, together with rising after-sales services, likely led tofurther acceleration in Hollysys' IA new order
        growth over the past quarter.</p>
