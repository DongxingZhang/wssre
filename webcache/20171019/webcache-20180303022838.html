    <p> MAS to maintain its neutral policy stance as Singapore's GDP growth slowsslightly in Q3; Export data to improve
        in other parts of EM Asia<br/><br/>
        Singapore¡¯s GDP growth (advance estimate) is likely to moderate slightly to2.8%yoy in Q3, from 2.9% in Q2,
        largely due to weaker stocking. With inflationarypressure also remaining weak, we expect the Monetary Authority
        of Singapore(MAS) to maintain its neutral stance.<br/><br/>
        China is likely to report stronger export growth of 7.9%yoy in September, vs.5.6% in August. With its import
        growth stronger, at 13.8% vs. 13.5% in the sameperiod, we expect China to report a narrower trade surplus of
        USD35.2bn inSeptember vs. USD41.9bn in August. We also see Taiwan and the Philippinesreporting stronger export
        data. In particular, we expect Taiwan's export growth toaccelerate to 16.6% in September, from 12.7% in August,
        while the Philippinessees its export growth rise to 11.0% in August from 10.4% in July. The latter'sindustrial
        production growth is also likely to rebound to +5.8% in August, from-1.1% in July.<br/><br/>
        We also expect India to report slightly stronger industrial production growth of1.7% in August, vs. 1.2% in
        July, while its inflation is likely to rise further to 3.5%in September, from 3.4% in August, led by higher food
        prices.</p>
