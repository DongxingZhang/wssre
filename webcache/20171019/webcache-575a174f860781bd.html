        Major copper smelters in China raise TC/RC¡¯s for 4Q17 by ~10% QoQ. ChinaSmelters Purchase Team (CSPT) set
        treatment fees at $95/t (vs. $86/t in 3Q17)and refining charges at 9.5c/lb (vs. 8.6). The increase reflects
        greater copperconcentrate supply in China and pushes TC/RC¡¯s above the 2017 annualbenchmark of $92.5/t and
        9.2c/lb. The increase could be an attempt to giveCSPT members more bargaining power during negotiations for 2018
        contractsas miners, smelters and traders meet in October and use a combination ofbenchmark prices to agree on
        TC/RC¡¯s. (Reuters)World crude steel production increased 6.3% YoY to 144m tons in August (-0.1% MoM), with
        capacity utilization of 72.2% (+330bps YoY, -20bps MoM).<br/><br/>
        China¡¯s output rose 8.7% YoY to record high of 75m tons (+0.8% MoM) andUS production up 6.3% YoY to 7.1m tons
        (+1.5% MoM). YTD global outputtotaled 1.1bn tons (+4.9% YoY). (WSA)Iron ore price declines 5% DoD to $66/t,
        driven by worries over impact on steelproduction from winter output cuts. Falling rebar price and expectations
        ofrising supply also dented demand (-8.5% WTD). Adding further headwinds,S&amp;P; Global Ratings downgraded
        China¡¯s credit rating. (Bloomberg Finance LP)China¡¯s Hebei provincial government sends officials to visit 38
        steel mills and 6coal and coking companies, seeking views on planned output cuts for airpollution control during
        winter (Nov 15-March 15). Hebei plans to reduce blastfurnace utilization rates to 50% during winter, in-line
        with Ministry ofEnvironmental Protections¡¯ latest directive. Market participants are still unclearas to how
        output cuts would be carried out and its impact to production. (SBB)North American Stainless raised base price
        for all cold-rolled stainless sheet byreducing functional discount by 2 percentage points. Also, plate prices
        wereincreased by $40-80/st, depending on thickness. Hike attributed to risingmanufacturing and operational cost.
        (SBB)Acacia Mining (Barrick stake: 64%) to reposition its Buzwagi mine, Tanzania toproduce only gold dore till
        end of mining life (2020). Buzwagi produces bothdore and gold/copper concentrate but a recent government ban on
        concentrateexports has prevented the mine from exporting and selling its concentrate,which accounts for ~65% of
        its output. While Acacia¡¯s overall 2017 productionand cost guidance remain unchanged, it expects to sell an
        additional 8-10kozof gold per month for remainder of the year from Buzwagi. (Mining Weekly)</p>
