    <p> 3Q17growth deceleration may hinder share price performance; we prefer Anta<br/><br/>
        After a very strong 2Q17, 3Q17¡¯s headline sellthrough growth may disappointsome investors. This may suppress
        Anta¡¯s and Li Ning¡¯s share prices in thenear term. However, more sophisticated indicators such as discount,
        sellout,and channel inventory suggest healthy demand. Solid demand duringOctober¡¯s golden week holiday also
        supports our positive view. Distributorsremain encouraged, leading to good 2Q18orderbook (the main factor
        behindour earnings upgrades). We still like the sector for its structural drivers andprefer Anta over Li Ning on
        Anta¡¯s potential outperformance during 3Q17.</p>
