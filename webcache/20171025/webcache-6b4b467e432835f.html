    <p> Risks from growing scale: The combined market value of the Top 3 glove makershas grown 2.5x vs. a decline of 16%
        in MSCI Malaysia in the last seven years (bothUSD-denominated). Their collective share of the market, which has
        grown at a CAGRof 6% during this time, has increased by 12ppt to 36%. As Malaysia companiesgained dominance in
        rubber glove manufacturing, competitive pressures startedemerging due to their aggressive expansion. Both
        earnings and share price volatilityincreased materially during the last three years since key firms are now
        large enoughindividually to influence the whole market.<br/><br/>
        Is growth volatility priced in? Sure, long-term demand growth of 6-8% p.a. issupported by low glove penetration
        in emerging Asia. The competitive advantage ofthe top firms has also increased with scale and a weak MYR;
        however, still marginpressure will likely intensify, as in 2014 and 2016, unless the key companies activelyalign
        new supply with demand growth. Their commitment to do so encourages us tobelieve in the base case of market
        share gains with steady margins. However,capacity management will likely take a toll on growth from time to
        time. In essence,downside risks to the base case rise as the size of the companies increases relativeto the
        sector. We believe this must be reflected in valuations.<br/><br/>
        Avoid overpaying amid higher risks; KRI the only Buy: The sector is justifiablyexpensive due to its solid track
        record, lack of financial leverage, and growingoligopolistic feel. All stocks are trading near life-time highs
        and our target prices arebased on one-year forward EV/EBITDA of two standard deviations over the
        long-termaverage. However, we prefer growth at the reasonable price of Kossan Rubber (KRI)over the maturity of
        Top Glove (TOPG), the biggest glove maker, or the pricey growthof Hartalega (HART), where stretched expectations
        are priced in at lofty multiples.<br/><br/>
        Our estimates for KRI and TOPG are below the Street but in line for HART, i.e.<br/><br/>
        relatively modest expectations are available at lower multiples in KRI.</p>
