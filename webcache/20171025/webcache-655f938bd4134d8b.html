    <p> Prime Minister Najib will table the 2018 budget on 27 October. The budget is not onlyan opportunity for the
        government to present its fiscal and growth assumptions for theyear ahead, but also to articulate its broad
        policy direction. We expect the governmentto continue with its medium-term quest for a ¡°near-balanced federal
        budget by 2020¡±,however, there is a risk that the timeline for achieving this goal is pushed back, assuggested
        by Second Finance Minister Johari (The Edge, 17 March) earlier this year.<br/><br/>
        We expect the government to deliver a budget with a headline deficit of 2.8%, animprovement from 3.0% in 2017.
        An acceleration in revenue should enable governmentto achieve this while still increasing expenditure to
        continue fiscal consolidation. Afterall, the PM has hinted that there will be good news for civil servants in
        the budget(The Star, 3 October), likely in the form of wage increases. We also expect continuedsupport to lower
        income households by way of various welfare payments.<br/><br/>
        This may come at the expense of development expenditure, particularly spendingon infrastructure. But this
        doesn¡¯t mean the economy will be starved of infrastructure.<br/><br/>
        In fact, we expect public investment to accelerate next year, achieved by way of offbudgetfinancing, thanks in
        particular to contributions from the private sector andforeigners (Chinese firms have committed to projects of
        USD45bn while Saudi Aramcohas committed USD7bn in financing to Petronas projects). As government-linked
        entitieswill retain control, these are likely to be classified as public investment.<br/><br/>
        Amid the policy debate and fiscal number crunching, one question will be high oneveryone¡¯s mind: When will the
        government call elections? They must be called by24 June 2018, when parliament will be automatically dissolved,
        after which there is a60-day window to call elections. Historically, all federal elections except 1999 havebeen
        held between March and October (as the monsoon season starts in November, aconcern for rural voters). It is
        therefore likely that they will be called in 1H18, suggestingthat 2018 will have an election year budget, which
        historically tends to include variouspro-consumer measures. In this piece, we look at some of the likely budget
        themes.<br/><br/>
        Rates strategy: HSBC EM Rates Research remains bullish on Malaysia localgovernment bonds ahead of the upcoming
        budget speech on 27 October. Fiscalconsolidation, together with further offshore inflows, should lead to a
        flatter yield curve.</p>
