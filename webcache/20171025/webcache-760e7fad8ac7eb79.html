    <p> 2Q numbers for Jio (not listed) suggest its annualised opex is c25% lower incomparison to Idea¡¯s. Jio seems to
        have some advantage on network and distributioncosts and incremental savings from lower termination costs as
        well; however, to maintainits current margins, a price hike is likely in our view. The mix of its own sites and
        30% ofsites at sharp rental discount to the market allows the company to have a medium-termadvantage on network
        costs. That said, we believe that as site mix changes more in favourof third party tower companies, network
        costs may rise. Some of the network costs andemployee costs are being currently capitalised as well by Jio. Jio
        is the only operatordeploying three spectrum frequency bands and operating in TD, suggesting power costsmay be
        on higher side of the industry average, however there is an offset as Jio hasinvested more on battery backup and
        incumbents may save by asking tower companies toinvest in solar/lithium batteries going forward. Reported
        distribution costs by Jio suggest theyare way lower versus incumbent telcos and may not be easy for incumbents
        to match.<br/><br/>
        However, incumbents may reduce the gap with broad-based adoption of bundled plansand increasing digital
        recharges. We believe that Jio¡¯s 2Q numbers may not fully reflect itssteady state cost structure as some of the
        employee and network costs have been fullycapitalised and we need more data points on Jio¡¯s distribution cost to
        fully understand largecost differentials. Given this we see a case for Jio taking up pricing c15%. Separately
        weadd that Jio seems to have an advantage versus incumbents on data capacity and thismay translate into Jio
        taking data market share, being better placed to upgrade to 5G atlower capex, and with an ability to add
        revenues from digital advertising.<br/><br/>
        We maintain our Buy rating on Bharti with an unchanged DCF-based TP of INR 490as we see the company benefiting
        from the recent Tata deal and standing to benefit froma potential increase in tariffs by Jio. We maintain our
        Reduce rating on Idea with anunchanged DCF-based TP of INR73. While we see the company benefiting from any
        tariffhikes we remain cautious as we think the company faces a challenging mergerintegration process to combine
        its operations with Vodafone India and we are of the viewthat company may lose market traction in the process.
