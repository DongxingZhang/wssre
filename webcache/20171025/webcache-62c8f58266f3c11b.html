    <p> The Trans-Pacific Partnership is still clinging on. Despite the US withdrawal fromthe deal earlier this year,
        the other 11 members are still aiming for ratification. Forgood reason: even without the world¡¯s largest
        economy, the agreement still offerstangible benefits to its remaining signatories. More importantly, it helps
        sustainmomentum towards trade liberalization, sets new standards for emerging tradeissues, such as intellectual
        property rights, and could serve as a stepping stonefor a much bigger free trade area if membership is expanded
        in the future. For aregion built on trade, the TPP offers hope.<br/><br/>
        Obstacles remain. The group cobbles together vastly different economies, from commodityexporters like Brunei,
        Peru, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, the service hub ofSingapore, to manufacturers like Mexico,
        Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia. Their levels ofdevelopment also differ enormously: stretching from some of the
        region¡¯s lowest to highest percapita incomes. This incongruity, however, is also the TPP¡¯s strength, even
        without the US: naturalcomplementarities would unleash benefits for all, none of which individual economies
        would beable to grasp on their own.<br/><br/>
        After several months of dithering, digesting the news of America¡¯s withdrawal, the remaining 11TPP members are
        thus back at the negotiating table. Progress has been relatively swift: the hardnegotiating part, after all, has
        already been concluded in preceding years. Adjusting the agreementto a smaller membership has been easier than
        initially thought. The US was important, to be sure,but it had offered relatively few concessions without which
        others would now feel compelled towithdraw entirely. Ministers are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the
        upcoming APEC summitin Vietnam next month, with hopes high that a final agreement can be reached.<br/><br/>
        It may not prove quite so easy, however. Prime Minister Abe has called an election for 22 October.<br/><br/>
        His government is firmly committed, but a weakened mandate could complicate ratification.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, in New Zealand, the close recent election result could weaken the country¡¯scommitment, or force the
        addition of more controversial stipulations, such as restrictions onforeigners buying property. Vietnam, too,
        has voiced reservations about intellectual property rightsprotections for pharmaceuticals that are part of the
        original TPP agreement. Some modifications tothe TPP may be needed.<br/><br/>
        Malaysia also seems to be wavering, having long held reservations about stipulations on publicprocurement and
        state-owned enterprises, while a looming election adds to the complications.<br/><br/>
        Across the Pacific, things aren¡¯t getting any easier as well. The North American Free TradeAgreement is
        currently under re-negotiation, adding to challenges for Canada and Mexico who areparties to both agreements.
