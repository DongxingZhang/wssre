        MSCI Europe has returned an impressive +31% since the post Brexit referendumlow, and the region has received the
        biggest share of new money globally invested inequity mutual funds over the year-to-date (USD90bn out of
        USD229bn). However,our analysis of cross-sectional volatility (CSV) implies that investors have not beentoo
        selective about where in Europe to invest in. At the industry group level, we findthat the dispersion of returns
        has fallen to a three-year low and within each sector wefind that the dispersion is below average in no less
        than 22of the 24industry groups.This could be about to change.¡£<br/><br/>
        Low levels of CSV unlikely to last¡£<br/><br/>
        When CSV has fallen to these depressed levels in the past, the next move has been up¨C an average rise of 35% in
        the following calendar year (chart 1). Moreover, the low levelof CSV could be a sign of investor complacency,
        surrounding the risks currentlyassociated with politics and economics in Europe. We question this benign outlook
        view.¡£<br/><br/>
        Banks: the dispersion of stock returns is particularly depressed¡£<br/><br/>
        One sector where the dispersion of stock returns is particularly depressed currently isbanks. Relative to
        history it is at a record low. Furthermore, the deviation from the sector¡¯slong-run average also looks extreme
        here when compared to other industry groups (chart6). Whilst macro factors may continue to dominate over the
        near term ¨C in particular theevolution of monetary policy ¨C the risk is that stock-specific factors begin to
        play a greaterrole in stock returns. Time to do some selective thinking perhaps? We list all Buy-ratedstocks in

        Utilising the analysts¡£<br/><br/>
        Utilities is another sector where the volatility of returns looks low relative to history,albeit not to the
        extreme level of banks. However, interestingly, the volatility of returnsis tentatively starting to pick-up
        (chart 3). It follows that selecting the right themes andstocks is becoming increasingly relevant. We list all
