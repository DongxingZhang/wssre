    <p> Raising target, reiterating at BUY: We raise our 12-month target price on SamsungSDI by 25% to KRW250,000,
        despite making upward revisions in July, as we now value: 1)its large-battery operations¡ªEV batteries and ESS¡ªat
        KRW4.9t [vs KRW2.3t previously]thanks to increased growth visibility in the global EV market; and 2) its stake
        in SamsungDisplay at 1x P/B or KRW4.8t¡ªvs a 30% discount to book value previously.<br/><br/>
        Large-battery business surprises, revising up 2018 forecasts: China and Indiahave joined the EU in saying they
        will ban the sale of internal combustion engine (ICE)vehicles, with the announcements followed by news of global
        automakers developing EVplatforms and battery sourcing. SDI¡¯s large-battery business has seen its ESS
        operationturn from the red as that for EV batteries has narrowed losses. Accordingly, we raise our2018 sales and
        operating profit estimates by a respective 10% and 28% to KRW8.4t andKRW367.5t, and as a primary supplier of
        ternary battery cells, the firm¡¯s market shareshould reach 15-20% in 2020 since that for EVs (PHEVs and BEVs) is
        seeing annualgrowth of 40%. The company acquired European automotive battery pack player MagnaStyer in 2015,
        which not only helped it gain market share with automakers, but also led toASP growth. Our estimates have its
        large-battery sales hitting KRW5.3t in 2020,including KRW3.2t for EV types.<br/><br/>
        Industry to gain momentum in 4Q: Shares in Samsung SDI rallied in 1H, buoyedby valuation hikes for Samsung
        Display after Apple said iPhones would feature OLED.<br/><br/>
        The stock received a further boost from 3Q by increased visibility of EV market expansionthat put the large
        battery value chain back in the spotlight. The company has seen neworders roll in as more nations unveil
        policies to nurture the EV industry and as leadingautomakers debut new EV models. Tesla also plans to soon
        commercialize an electricpickup truck and commence global sales for the Model 3 in 4Q, all of which bode well
        forshares in SDI.</p>
