    <p> Samsung Bioepis set to debut fifth biosimilar in Europe: The Committee forMedicinal Products for Human Use
        (CHMP) on Sep 15 recommended the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMA) approve Samsung Bioepis¡¯s Herceptin biosimilar
        Ontruzant(EMEA/H/C/004323), which should be the world¡¯s first Herceptin biosimilar to launchin Europe in early
        2018¡ªnb, the original¡¯s patent expired in 2014. With final approvalprobable in November or December, the firm
        would be alone with five blockbusterbiologics biosimilars available in Europe¡ªfor Humira, Enbrel, Remicade,
        Herceptin, andLantus, which saw global sales of a respective USD16.5b, USD9.2b, USD8.9b, USD6.9b,and USD6.3b
        last year. Approval would also give the company another first-moveradvantage there after its Enbrel
        biosimilar.<br/><br/>
        Herzuma could get the nod from CHMP in December: Mylan on Aug 16withdrew an application with the EMA for its
        Herceptin biosimilar EMEA/H/C/004346,while on Sep 15 Celltrion submitted a response letter for Day 120 list of
        questions (LoQ)with the agency for its version (Herzuma). Barring outstanding issues within 60 daysafterwards,
        the drug should receive an EMA opinion on Day 180 before receiving CHMPrecommendation on Day 210 in December. If
        the agency finds outstanding issues withinthe initial 60 days, however, Celltrion will have to submit another
        response letter with theCHMP¡¯s opinion expected no sooner than 30 days thereafter. We therefore expectOntruzant
        to launch in Europe at least three months ahead of Herzuma.<br/><br/>
