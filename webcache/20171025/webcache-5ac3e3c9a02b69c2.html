    <p> 3Q preview: We expect LG Chem to post a largely flat q-q 3Q operating profit ofKRW722.3b, with spread-driven
        gains in the chemical business offsetting a drop in profitsfrom the green and red bio divisions.<br/><br/>
        Chemicals: We expect the chemical division to report an operating profit of KRW716b(up 4.5% q-q) thanks to
        recoveries in the prices and spreads of its main products. NCCspreads are up 19.8% q-q on rebounding butadiene
        prices, while ABS spreads haveremained solid. SBR spreads, though, likely have slipped q-q, as raw material
        priceshave soared in 3Q and the firm set prices at the previews quarter¡¯s averages.<br/><br/>
        IT&amp;E; materials: Operating profit in the IT&amp;E; division will likely fall 17.6% q-q toKRW19.3b, with
        downstream industry conditions turning sluggish.<br/><br/>
        Batteries: The battery division should post an operating profit of KRW9.5b (up27.2% q-q). Margin will likely
        improve further, given that the company has beenpassing on cost increases for small batteries to clients since
        June.<br/><br/>
        Farm Hannong &amp; Life Science: We believe Farm Hannong (green bio) will turn toan operating loss of KRW8.1b on
        seasonality, while Life Sciences (red bio) will seeoperating profit fall 53.6% q-q to KRW8.8b, with margin
        normalizing fromexceptionally high 1H levels after R&amp;D; spending started being recognized on thebalance
        sheet.</p>
