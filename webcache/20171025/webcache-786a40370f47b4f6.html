    <p> 3Q preview: Our 3Q forecasts have the consolidated gross sales of Hyundai DepartmentStore edging up 0.5% y-y to
        KRW1.27t along with net sales growth of 0.3% y-y toKRW424.9b and an operating profit drop of 5.6% y-y to
        KRW77.3b, with the latter two tomiss their respective consensus estimates of KRW436.5b and KRW80.6b. The
        company¡¯ssame store sales (SSS) fell a respective 1.5% and 1.7% y-y in 1Q and 2Q, with the 3Q figureset to be
        flat after falling a respective 1% and 2% y-y in July and August before turningaround this month. This seems
        attributable to Chuseok falling in early October this year,however, so we foresee SSS growth returning to
        negative territory from next month.<br/><br/>
        The retailer¡¯s sluggish top-line growth owes to: 1) domestic consumption suffering fromgovernment measures to
        cool the real estate market along with increased geopoliticaluncertainties at home and abroad; 2) department
        store demand weakening structurally;and 3) y-y sales contractions at its stores in Daegu [as Shinsegae opened a
        branch there]Cheonho [which is undergoing remodeling through end-2018] and Mia [with thatcommunity¡¯s population
        plunging amid numerous redevelopment/reconstructionprojects]. Consequently, HDS is bound to see its operating
        profit fall y-y this quarter.</p>
