    <p> What¡¯s new? Starting in Asia, Fast Retailing (9983 JP, not-rated) expects FY Aug-18 sales to be +10%,
        accelerating from a 4% growth in FY17 driven by UniqloInternational. In Europe, Puma (PUM GR, Hold, CMP
        EUR352.75, covered by Anne-Laure Bismuth) continues its strong momentum with 3Q17 sales +13% on reportedterms
        (or +17% FX-neutral), 2% ahead of Bloomberg consensus. Puma also raisedfull year FX-neutral sales guidance to
        +14-16% (from 12-14%). In the US, Kohl¡¯s(KSS US, not-rated) is now selling Amazon devices and accepting Amazon
        returns(CNBC, 18 Oct). Key implications to HK-listed supply chain:Shenzhou (2313 HK): The vertically-integrated
        supplier has c20% and 10%revenue exposure to the two brands respectively, based on our estimates.<br/><br/>
        Yue Yuen (551 HK): Yue Yuen¡¯s retail subsidiary Pou Sheng (3813 HK, notrated)is a key partner to Puma in China,
        which we believe could be the keydriver to Asia Pacific sales growth.<br/><br/>
        Li &amp; Fung (494 HK): We estimate Kohl¡¯s is a key customer to Li &amp; Fung and itsteam-up with Amazon could
        boost store traffic.<br/><br/>
        Nameson (1982 HK, not-rated): Apart from being a sweater supplier to FastRetailing, Nameson could see exposure
        to Puma¡¯s knitted shoe upper businessupon potential acquisition of V. Success (announced on 28 Sep
        2017).<br/><br/>
        Prefer Li &amp; Fung in the space. We adjust down Pacific Textiles (Hold) earnings by 6-8% for FY18-20e in this
        report to factor in the impact from the Vietnam plantsuspension. Consequently, our new TP is HKD8.70 (from
        HKD9.40) based on anunchanged 13x CY18e PE. We make no other changes in this report. We like Li &amp;Fung;, as
        we find the risk-reward attractive trading at c11x FY18e (ex-perpetuals) PE,c7% dividend yield on the back of
        11% FY16-19e core operating profit CAGR. We rateStella Reduce as we are cautious on a margin recovery. We have a
        Hold rating onShenzhou and Yue Yuen. Sector downside risks: unfavourable trade policies; sharpadverse change in
        macro conditions.</p>
