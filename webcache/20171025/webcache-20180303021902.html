    <p> 3Q17 preview: Solid earnings should continue.<br/><br/>
        Banks in our coverage release 3Q17 results from 26 October 2017. The magnitude ofNIM expansion should slow
        (1-2bps q-o-q vs. +9bps in 1H17) but a sub-normal levelof credit cost should continue at large commercial banks,
        supporting the risk-adjustedmargin. Although there may be a provisioning burden due to Kumho Tire, we expectthe
        level of recurring credit cost to remain low (26bps at large commercial banks)after multi-year portfolio
        restructuring and a focus on collateralised lending. The Bankof Korea¡¯s monthly data suggest industry loan
        growth was robust in 3Q17, recording2.2% q-o-q growth (+2.0% in mortgages given a strong pick-up before
        strictermortgage rules became effective from 23 August).<br/><br/>
        Regulatory concerns likely to ease given limited fundamental impact.<br/><br/>
        The soon-to-be announced HH debt measures will likely fall within expectations(i.e., introducing DSR, tighter
        underwriting guidelines for multi-homeowners, andsupportive measures for lower-income households), unlike the
        August propertymeasures, which were stronger than expected. Recent news (5 Sep, Yonhap) oncutting the lending
        rate on delinquent loans and raising LDR weights for householdloans will have a limited impact, sub-1% of annual
        earnings.<br/><br/>
        Recent correction provides opportunity to add to positions: Prefer KB FG andHana given greater room to improve
        on cost and capital management.<br/><br/>
        Korean Bank shares have been weak due to regulatory concerns surrounding thehousehold debt issue. However, as
        they continue to deliver solid earnings, in line withraised consensus expectations, we believe shares can
        recover. We marginally reviseour estimates and TPs after reflecting a better than expected credit cost trend
        whileapplying a higher tax rate assumption for 2018-19e. Valuation and risks on page 8.</p>
