    <p> Growing AI adoption among high-end smartphones: In conjunction with ourrecent Mediatek report (Mediatek: Sizing
        the ASIC opportunity, 13Oct 2017), wherewe discussed the trend of system houses developing high-end application
        processorsinternally, and our AI thematic reports (Artificial Intelligence: Chips with everything, 16Oct 2017and
        Artificial intelligence and the productivity paradox, 15Aug 2017), wehighlight another trend of high-end
        smartphones incorporating AI/machine learningfunctionalities and neural processing units (NPUs). We believe this
        trend, asobservable through recent launches of Apple¡¯s A11and Huawei¡¯s Kirin 970, will allowboth software and
        hardware developers to further extend smartphones¡¯ capabilities inareas such as 3D sensing/AR/VR/real-time data
        processing, further improve the userexperience and potentially excite the stagnant global smartphone demand
        again.¡£<br/><br/>
        AI development still at early stages: Although we have just started to witness newdevelopments in new
        functionalities, such as Apple¡¯s new FaceID, we expect moreapplications to emerge and utilize the potentiality
        of AI/machine learning. We believeHuawei¡¯s approach of combining on-device and cloud machine calculations to
        createa mobile AI should be a good example. Looking forward, we expect support fromdevelopers in algorithm and
        software/application development to further acceleratethe deployment of AI functionalities. As part of the
        development, we expect futureapplication processors to exhibit larger die sizes as a result of NPU additions,
        and therelationship between chipset providers and smartphone vendors to become eventighter given higher
        integration between software and hardware.¡£<br/><br/>
        Outlook for key players: We believe a top priority for vendors will be to further investin extending their
        hardware framework to better facilitate an environment that isfriendly for AI. Huawei (Not Listed) has announced
        plans to work with developers withdifferent application know-how in advancing algorithms. Qualcomm (QCOM US,
        CMPUSD52.8, Not Rated) has taken up a different approach with its AI software platform,the Snapdragon Neural
        Processing Engine, which aims at incorporating AI through asoftware platform. For Mediatek, we also expect
        resources to be invested in buildingthe framework for AI/machine learning. Local media source, Economic Daily
        (20September 2017) reported that Mediatek will launch its AI incorporated chipset P70in2018. We think this could
        potentially be an opportunity for Mediatek to further solidifyits relationship with customers as they will rely
        more heavily on chipset vendors.Although we do not expect to see a material impact in the near term, we believe
        thetrend will very likely be a game changer and will continue to monitor this trend closely.¡£</p>
