    <p> Opportunities and challenges in new retail. Alibaba has made significant progress inseveral new retail use cases
        including Hema (O2O fresh food), Intime (shopping mallupgrade), and LST system (B2B wholesale platform). The
        company believes that the newretail environment not only involves the online and offline omni-channel, but also
        omnimarketing,omni-supply chain and, most importantly, omni-business. It has ambitions toobtain a larger market
        share in China and the global retail market by bringing newbusiness models together to improve the efficiency
        for retailers and consumers.<br/><br/>
        Hema: the best model for new retail. Hema¡¯s CEO, Mr. Yi Hou, believes that it hascompleted its early development
        stage, and will enter a new stage of nationalexpansion. Hema¡¯s business model has been established and proven to
        be superior totraditional C2C and B2C platforms in FMCG and fresh food. Hema stores are able toorganically
        attract location-based traffic within 3km, and the user acquisition cost is farlower than its online peers. With
        an efficient consumer management system, theconversion and retention ratios are 10x higher than that of
        traditional e-commerceplatforms. Hema also plans to gain greater bargain power vs. suppliers with its
        growingscale and, as a result, may launch its own high-quality private-label food products.<br/><br/>
        Intime: from -1 to 0. Intime, a leading regional shopping mall chain, was acquired andconsolidated into the
        Alibaba Group in May 2017. Currently, Intime is still in its transitionphase from a traditional commercial
        property operator to a new retail platform.<br/><br/>
        Currently, Intime is a drag on the overall business (-1) and management is movingrapidly to remove this drag (0)
        before creating value (+1). It has been a time consumingexercise for the store to digitalize every procedure of
        its core operation, with thecompany developing suitable business models to integrate its online user base with
        itsoffline user base. Intime has established a shopping mall operation system/App namedMiaojie, as its central
        area of operation and client services.<br/><br/>
        LST system to reach last one mile retail. Alibaba LST system is a B2B wholesaleplatform servicing unchained
        mom-and-pop shops in local communities. Alibababelieves the strong connection between groceries and local
        communities is extremelyvaluable in the new retail world. LST will: (1) supply the stores with
        previouslyunattainable products directly from brands and at a competitive price, (2) digitalise theirbusiness
        with real-time inventory monitoring system, and (3) deliver inventories in atimely fashion with a 3-layer
        warehouse system covering 200 cities. The key challengeis to persuade millions of stores to try the service via
        a massive marketing effort. Moststore owners are very conservative and reluctant to take any risk. By end-2017,
        23% ofthe stores in China will use B2B to source inventories, and goods purchased from B2Bplatforms will account
        for 15% of their total GMV. By 2020, Alibaba expects thepenetration rate in grocery stores to increase to 45%
        with cRMB300bn total GMV. Sofar, LST has covered 0.5mn stores, and expects to cover 1mn stores by end-2018.</p>
