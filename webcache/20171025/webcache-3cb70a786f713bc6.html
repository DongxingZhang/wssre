    <p> The Fed is doing it. The ECB may soon. But don¡¯t count on the BoJ to start exitingits ultra-loose policy for the
        foreseeable future. That matters for the rest of Asia: asothers gently apply the brakes, Japan¡¯s central bank at
        least provides a littlebuffer. Still, questions abound: the country¡¯s upcoming general election mightraise
        worries about the BoJ¡¯s commitment. Plus, look closely, and monetaryofficials have already tapered their JGBs
        purchases. All signs of an impendingshift in policy? Nope. A premature end to the current stimulus would put at
        risk thesmall, though meaningful, gains already attained. Even the opposition agrees thatthe BoJ should stay its
        course for now. Meanwhile, the framework of ¡®yield curvecontrol¡¯ means that JGB purchases are no longer the
        measure by which the centralbank¡¯s stance should be judged. It¡¯ll keep its foot firmly on the gas for a long
        timeto come.<br/><br/>
        The big unwind may be upon us. After hiking short-term rates several times, the Fed this monthstarted to shrink
        its balance sheet. And it¡¯ll step up the pace of reduction in months to come.<br/><br/>
        Markets have so far taken it all in their stride. But risks remain, not least to emerging economies inAsia.
        These may become more apparent next year when the ECB starts to taper its purchases. Atsome point over the
        second half of 2018, the combined balance sheet of the G3 central banks maythus begin to contract. Investors
        beware. The massive infusion of central bank liquidity since theGlobal Financial Crisis has undoubtedly buoyed
        asset markets, everywhere. Who is to say that areversal won¡¯t leave a mark as well?That puts the focus on the
        BoJ. Inflation is far below the central bank¡¯s target of 2 per cent, andwill likely remain nailed down for quite
        a while. That should cushion the impact of policy changesby the Fed and ECB, perhaps not globally but at least
        to some degree in the region.<br/><br/>
        But two questions remain. First, could the impending general election, to be held on 22 October,lead to a
        premature end of ultra-loose monetary policy in Japan? Unlikely. Even if the BoJ¡¯snegative deposit rates remain
        unpopular, and massive JGB buying causes unease among someofficials, there is a recognition across the political
        spectrum that abandoning the current policystance would be severely disruptive at this juncture. Yuri Koike, the
        Tokyo governor and de-factoleader of the opposition, suggested, too, that the BoJ will need to stay its
        course.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, Prime Minister Abe, should he stay in office following the election, could re-appointGovernor
        Haruhiko Kuroda for another term in April, or is at least likely to nominate a similarlydovish successor, thus
        ensuring policy continuity. The Prime Minister, of course, could face aleadership challenge at an LDP gathering
        in September 2018 should the election not deliver adecisive enough mandate, but that would leave him with enough
        time to guide the appointmentprocess.</p>
