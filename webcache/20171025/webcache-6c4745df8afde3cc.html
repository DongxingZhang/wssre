    <p> The government of Indonesia announced a 10.04% Y-o-Y increase in the weightedaverage excise tax rate for tobacco
        products in 2018 (kompas.com, 19 October). Theincrease is ahead of our expectations. In our note Gudang Garam:
        Reduce:Concerns remain on strategy, capex, and dividend, dated 12 September, we outlineour expectations for a
        9.0% increase for GGRM and 8.5% increase for HMSP. Theincrease takes into account various issues including
        health, illicit products, livelihoodand job creation, and revenue target. The impact of the excise tax increase
        onindividual companies will only be known when the Finance Ministry Regulation isreleased along with details on
        excise tax rate by product category and by capacity,which we expect to be in November 2017.<br/><br/>
        Philip Morris affirmed its guidance for a 3% volume decline in FY2017.<br/><br/>
        PM also released some operational data. Even though volume rebounded on a Q-o-Q basis, for 9M17 HMSP volume
        contracted by 5.5%, ahead of the national peers¡¯estimate for a 3.9% contraction. There is no change to PM¡¯s
        guidance for a 3%decline in the Indonesian tobacco volume in FY2017. PM does not give out anyguidance for HMSP¡¯s
        volume. The higher-than-expected excise tax increase remainsa concern in an environment where volume continues
        to contract.<br/><br/>
        No change to our TPs and ratings.<br/><br/>
        We maintain a Hold rating on HM Sampoerna with an unchanged TP of IDR3,720and a Reduce rating on Gudang Garam
        with an unchanged TP of IDR54,000.</p>
