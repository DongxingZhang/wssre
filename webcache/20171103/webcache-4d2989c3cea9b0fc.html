    <p> Strong sales growth on recovering sector growth and market sharegains. We estimate the industry retail growth
        recovered from low singledigit in 3Q16 to high single digit in 3Q17, helped by less price discounton more
        balanced supply. Meanwhile, Yili's market share in Ambient/chilled products/IMF expanded from 31%/15%/5.7% to
        34%/16%/6%respectively (Figure 1).<br/><br/>
        Selling expense/sales ratio declined 100bps yoy to 21.9%, helped byeasing of competition within a more balanced
        supply environment.<br/><br/>
        G&amp;A; expense declined 150bps yoy to 6.2% from a high base, as Yiliincurred incremental G&amp;A; for some
        one-off event (i.e. internal propertymaintenance).<br/><br/>
        SG&amp;A; expense savings was partly offset by 102bps yoy decline in grossmargin, due to rising raw milk and
        packaging prices.<br/><br/>
        Improving inventory turnover indicates that 4Q growth to remain strong.<br/><br/>
        Inventory days improved from 31.9 days in 3Q16 to 30 days in 3Q17. Given theproduction date is an important
        decision factor when consumers choose brandsin retail ends, the shorten inventory days indicate improving fresh
        level of theproducts, which should help to drive its sales growth in 4Q17. The improvinginventory days also
        indicate a more balanced supply and demand market.<br/><br/>
        We expect the recovery trend to continue with an under supply environment.<br/><br/>
        We believe Yili's growth recovery from 2Q is mainly driven by more balancedsupply from 2017. After three years
        capacity reductions for upstream dairy farmsfrom 2014, raw milk supply is becoming more balanced with demand
        from 2017.<br/><br/>
        During the over supply environment, smaller dairy players could source raw milkat a heavy discount compared with
        large brands, but during the under supply environment from 2017, smaller players need to pay a premium instead.
        This helpslarge players such as Yili and Mengniu to gain market share.<br/><br/>

        We are revising up our earnings forecast by 2-4% in 2017-19E, mainly to factorin higher-than-expected sales
        driven by Yili's market share gains. We revise upour TP by 13% to Rmb31.6 based on a DCF approach, factoring in
        a 9.5% WACC(3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta, debt-free structure) and 2% terminal growth. Wereiterate Yili as our
        top pick among our A share coverage. Downside risks: higherthan-expected raw material price increase, food
        safety incidents and worse-thanexpectedcompetition.</p>
