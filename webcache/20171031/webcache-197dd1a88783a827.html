    <p> Hurricane headwinds in Q3 should become tailwinds in Q4.Top Pick: DWDP.<br/><br/>
        Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on August 25, cast a long shadow overUS chemicals in Q3. Due to the
        hurricane and its aftermath many US chemicalcompanies experienced negative impacts from shuttered plants,
        lostproduction, tight raw material supply conditions, higher distribution andlogistics costs and supply chain
        disruptions. As a result no less than a dozenUS chemical companies preannounced earnings shortfalls or talked
        downnumbers for the quarter. The good news is that underlying demand ex Harveyremained solid in Q3 and Q4 should
        see benefits from the hurricane in the formof price increases, restocking and rebuilding. Top picks: DWDP, EMN,
        ASH.<br/><br/>
        Global GDP growth is expected to accelerate from 3.1% in ¡¯16 to 3.6% in ¡¯17.<br/><br/>
        DB¡¯s economics team forecasts US GDP growth slowed to 2.0% in Q3 from 3.1% inQ2. For Q4, US GDP growth is
        forecast to accelerate to 3.1% as most of the lostoutput and delayed purchases in Q3 due to hurricane related
        disruptions areexpected to be made up in Q4. In Europe, DB¡¯s economics team forecasts Q3 GDPgrowth of 0.6% QoQ.
        For Q4, Europe GDP growth is forecast to slow slightly to0.5% QoQ. China¡¯s GDP growth slowed to to 6.6% in Q3
        from 6.9% in Q2. For ¡¯17DB¡¯s economics team forecasts US GDP growth of 2.4% (vs 1.8% in ¡¯16), EuropeGDP growth
        of 2.2% (vs 1.8% in ¡¯16), China GDP growth of 6.7% (vs 6.7% in ¡¯16)and global GDP growth of 3.7% (vs 3.1% in
        ¡¯16).<br/><br/>
        Ethylene chain margins compress in Q3.<br/><br/>
        US contract ethylene margins compressed 3.7 c/lb in Q3 to 14.8 c/lb on flat prices(at 31.9 c/lb) and higher
        production costs (up 3.7 c/lb to 16.4 c/lb and up 34% YoY).<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, polyethylene (PE) prices rose $0.02/lb in Q3 (to $0.75 for HDPE) asHurricane Harvey resulted in
        extensive capacity shutdowns leading to materialbecoming short or non-existent in some cases. In Q4, we expect
        US ethylene chainmargins to improve as hurricane-induced tight supply/demand fundamentalssupport elevated PE
        pricing. We expect hurricane impacts and supply/demandtightness will linger thru October and pass starting in
        November.<br/><br/>
        Differentiated / specialty chemical companies forecast to post 10% EPS growth.<br/><br/>
        In Q3,we expect Specialty and Differentiated Chemical companies to post 10% YoYEPS growth driven by solid
        demand, FX tailwinds, cost reductions and sharebuybacks. We expect Commodity Chemical producers to post YoY
        higher earningson higher prices and growing demand.<br/><br/>
        Top Picks: DowDuPont, Ashland Global and Eastman.<br/><br/>
        DowDuPont: With the September 1 merger of Dow and DuPont the 2 iconic USchemical companies have become one ¨C at
        least for the next 18 months. Thereafterthey will split into 3 companies. We believe this 3 way separation will
        drivesubstantial value creation thru enhanced focus, strong free cash flow and portfoliooptionality. Ex
        hurricane impacts, we expect Q3 to show further improvement onthe strength of cost reductions. Ashland: If
        Ashland is successful in validating ASI(80% of ¡®18E EBITDA) is a high margin, high quality specialty chemical
        business,we believe its 1-2 EBITDA point discount to peers will close (1 EBITDA pt =$10/shr). And if it cannot,
        we believe downside is limited as Ashland is an attractiveasset in a consolidating industry. Eastman: The
        company¡¯s recent announcementthat excluding the impact of the Kingsport fire ¡¯17 EPS would be at the high end
        ofits 10-12% EPS guidance range was a critical step in restoring investor confidencein the ability of management
        to deliver on its expectations. If Eastman can deliver ina similar fashion in ¡¯18, we believe its P/E multiple
        will expand by 1-2 pts.</p>
