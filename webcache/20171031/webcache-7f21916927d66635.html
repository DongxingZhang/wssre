    <p> In the Czech Republic, the constitution vests relatively strong powers withthe President, and has a traditional
        parliamentary system, with two chambers.<br/><br/>
        The Chamber of Deputies is entrusted with greater powers than the Senate,especially regarding the exercise of
        parliamentary scrutiny over the government.<br/><br/>
        The Chamber of Deputies also has greater legislative powers than the Senate. Forexample, in the case of
        proposals for regular laws, the Chamber of Deputies mayvote to overrule the Senate, if the Senate has rejected a
        legislative proposal orproposed any amendments.<br/><br/>
        The Constitution dictates that a system of proportional representation must beused to elect the Chamber of
        Deputies. All 200 deputies are elected in a singleround of voting, held in 14 regions of the country. There is
        an election thresholdthat determines the minimum number of votes that a political party must receivein elections
        in order to be allocated a mandate (mandates) in the Chamber ofDeputies. The newest version of the election law
        gives the following thresholds:5% for a single political party or political movement; 10% for a coalition of
        twopolitical parties or political movements; 15% for a coalition of three politicalparties or political
        movements.<br/><br/>
        The government is formed by the members of the Chambers of Deputies andthe leader becomes the Prime Minister,
        usually for a full term of four years. Thepresident has the power to appoint the prime minister of the new
        government,but typically asks the leader of a large minority party to form a new government.<br/><br/>
        There is no constitutional deadline for the President to appoint the new primeminister. The newly appointed PM,
        however, has 30 days to obtain a vote ofconfidence from the Parliament, and must have full cabinet nominations
        by then.<br/><br/>
        The government wins the vote of confidence by an absolute majority, with quorumof 67 deputies. In the event of
        no confidence, the president can dissolve thechamber, and call early elections.</p>
