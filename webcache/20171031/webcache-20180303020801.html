        US housing starts dropped 4.7% MoM to SAAR of 1.13m units (vs. consensusof 1.18m) in September. Housing permits
        decreased 4.5% to 1.22m (vs.<br/><br/>
        consensus of 1.25m). Single-family home starts fell 5% to 829k, driven by a15% decline in the South region due
        to the impact of the hurricanes. However,underlying momentum remained strong, with starts up 6% YoY. We
        expectsingle-family starts to rebound in October and also revised upwards forSeptember as data collection for
        starts was impacted by hurricanes. Multi-familyactivity has been declining since mid-2015 and will serve as a
        headwind tooverall starts/permits growth. (Bloomberg Finance LP, DB).<br/><br/>

        continue if it is used as input in manufacturingand re-exported as finished jewelry. (Reuters).<br/><br/>
