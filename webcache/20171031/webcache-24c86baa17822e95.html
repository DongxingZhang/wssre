    <p> Weekly flows into global equity funds in % of NAV terms hit a 5-month highlast week with strong gains in
        developed market (11-week high) and emergingmarket equity fund mandates alike (5-month high). In USD-terms, the
        $6.6billion of weekly inflows even meant an all-time high, but needs to be adjustedfor the rapidly expanding
        global fund flow universe over the past three years.<br/><br/>
        Interestingly, within both regions, investors mostly chose broad diversified fundsover specific country
        exposures, arguably avoiding a host of (geo-)political risksin the regions. Albeit at a low level, US equity
        funds gained inflows for the firsttime in the four weeks and the break of US macro surprises into positive
        territorybodes well for US flow momentum over the coming weeks (see Fig. 1). Europeanequity funds, while
        reporting the lowest weekly inflows over the past four weeksas Spanish outflows continued, still expanded their
        regional inflow streak into thesixth week. Funds with a European equity mandate have absorbed $35 billion
        ofinflows over the past six months while their US counterparts have seen $30 billionof fund redemptions, but we
        expect relative macro surprises between Europe andUS to turn in favour of the US over the coming months, which
        would suggestdownside for European equity flows relative to those in the US (see Fig. 2).</p>
