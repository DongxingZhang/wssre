    <p> We have raised our estimates for most commodities, most notably for copper,zinc, nickel and coking coal (Fig
        10). As a result, we lift 2017-18 EBITDA estimatesby c.5%-10% across our coverage (Fig 11). For the large caps
        we sit c.10% above2018 consensus EBITDA. Stock picks : As outlined in our recent note Pick thecommodity, pick
        the cash flow investors should focus on two themes - cash flowquality and commodity exposure; our top picks are
        RIO (valuation, cash returns),GLEN (copper and zinc exposure, latent capacity growth) and FM (leading coppername
        for 2-3 year growth).<br/><br/>
        Copper: deficits from 2018.<br/><br/>
        We now expect the copper market to be in a sustained deficit from 2018(previously 2019) and have raised our 2018
        forecast by ~15% from $257c/lbto $297c/lb. We expect a greater deficit in 2018 of 295 kt (compared to 255kt
        previously) given slower expected pace of commissioning at several majorprojects including Katanga and Cobre
        Panama. We see sustained market deficitssupporting further upside through 2021.<br/><br/>
        Iron ore: buy the dips for a spring 2018 rebound.<br/><br/>
        As outlined in our recent iron ore report we expect Chinese steel production cutsover heating season (Nov to
        March) to put downward pressure on prices nearterm. We now forecast US$55/t for 4Q17 then a recovery to US$70/t
        by mid-2018;we think the winter restrictions could lead to a strong pick-up in demand in Spring2018. Our margin
        curve shows that c. 15% of global iron ore production losescash at US$50/t and we now see the fair value range
        for 62% Fe at US$50-70/t.<br/><br/>
        RIO and BHP are already discounting iron ore in the low $50s and we would useany weakness as a buying
        opportunity.<br/><br/>
        Mid-cycle valuation check: medium term re-rating potential.<br/><br/>
        We think ongoing capital/supply discipline and a focus on cash flow over growthcan re-rate the majors over the
        medium term (~20% upside to our mid-cyclevaluations).Our valuation framework, based around mid-cycle returns and
        cashflows, provides investors with a clear picture of what is 'in the price'. We thinkmid cycle FCF yields of
        8-11% are deliverable; if translated to a ~5% dividendwould make the sector one of the most attractive yielding
        in the market.</p>
