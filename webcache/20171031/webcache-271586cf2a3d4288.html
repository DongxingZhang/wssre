    <p> MTD GGR growth improved as VIPs came at tail-end of Golden Week.<br/><br/>
        This afternoon, Gaming Bureau (DICJ) released VIP vs mass GGR split for 3Q.<br/><br/>
        Like in 2Q, VIP GGR sharply outgrew mass table GGR in 3Q (35% yoy vs 6.7%yoy; or 7.9% qoq vs 4.7% qoq). This
        supports our previews which forecast WynnMacau (Buy) &amp; Galaxy (Hold) to deliver the strongest EBITDA qoq
        growth in 3Q.<br/><br/>
        On the flip side, we expect MGM China (Buy) &amp;SJM; (Hold) to be the weakestin 3Q as typhoons impacted casinos
        in Peninsula more than those in Cotai.<br/><br/>
        Separately, local consultants estimate that Macau MTD GGR (Oct 1-15th) is runratingMOP920m/day, or 16% yoy. This
        is a slight improvement from the low-teenGGR growth for Oct 1-8th, as some VIPs came at the tail-end of Golden
        Week toavoid crowds. However, mass GGR might only be growing at single-digit yoy asyesterday's typhoon disrupted
        ferry schedules for most of the day.<br/><br/>
        Why did VIP outgrow Mass by so much in 3Q.<br/><br/>
        In our report (3Q preview, 12 Oct 17), we explained that the sharp VIP growth in 3Qwas due to the aggressive
        expansion by small junkets. In 3Q, over 20 junket roomswere opened, of which 6-7 by new junkets. Among all the
        small junkets, we seeDavid Group the most aggressive as they have opened 4 VIP rooms so far this year,including
        the latest in Galaxy Macau (opened August). We expect David Group toopen another junket room by year-end, likely
        at MGM Peninsula. After adjustingDICJ data for re-classification, we estimate that VIP GGR +33% yoy while
        MassGGR +13% yoy in 3Q17. This mix-shift has a -ve impact on margin, though likelyoffset by operating leverage.
        As such, we expect 3Q industry property EBITDA+7% qoq (+18% yoy) and industry EBITDA margin roughly flat qoq at
        24.5%.<br/><br/>
        Sector already pulled back slightly after weak Golden Week trends; key risks.<br/><br/>
        Month-to-date, Macau stocks have pulled back 5% (vs MSCI HK +2%). We thinkthis has largely priced in the
        disappointing Golden Week GGR run-rate. Macaustocks now trade at 13.6x 12m fwd EV/EBITDA, which we view as
        reasonable.<br/><br/>
        We value Macau stocks on SOTP. Downside risks include a sharp slowdown inGGR momentum and regulatory changes.
