    <p> Jio pricing is inline with our sector view of normalization of pricing.<br/><br/>
        Jio has reduced the validity period on its popular Rs 399 plans from 84 days to70 days implying a 20% price
        increase. Further it has introduced a new Rs459plan with 84-day validity, a 15% price increase. See table for
        chronology ofJio¡¯s plans and effective price increases since it started charging for its servicesince Apr/17. We
        believe Jio¡¯s pricing trends suggests a progressivelynormalization of sector pricing which was significantly
        impacted by its freelaunch offer in Sept/2016.<br/><br/>
        A lower sector revenue table is a significant risk for Jio.<br/><br/>
        We believe Jio¡¯s initial strategy of a free launch offer was rational - it had toencourage customer sampling of
        its country-wide network in the shortestpossible time. However a continuation of aggressive pricing poses a
        significantrisk for Jio. The incumbents have been successful in rolling out 4G anddefending their rev-share via
        calibrated offers to counter Jio. We believe anexpanding sector revenue-base is crucial to support a fair return
        on Jiomassive investment of c$22-23bn in the wireless business.<br/><br/>
        Pricing increase is supportive of our Buy recommendations on Bharti and Idea.<br/><br/>
        We believe Bharti recent acquisitions cement its cost leadership in the sectorand provide the company with a
        robust spectrum position. Idea¡¯s ongoingmerger with Vodafone has a operating risk ¨C nevertheless the cost
        synergiesand benefit are significant and outweigh the risks. An improving sector pricingis the key catalyst
        stock performance. We retain our ratings: Bharti ( BUY, TPRs 480) and Idea (BUY, TO Rs 120).</p>
