    <p> We visited Guangzhou, Foshan and Zhuhai in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau (GHM) Greater Bay area last week, which are
        the core, satellite andlaggard cities, respectively, in the region. The companies we met areconfident regarding
        the long-term economic and property market outlookin GHM. They believe the world-class infrastructure network
        that creates¡°one hour commuting circles¡± will help promote stronger dispersion ofcapital/talent, more balanced
        economic development in the region androbust integration between more advanced East GHM and relativelylaggard
        west end. We believe a vibrant macro in GHM will continue toattract investments, foster business development and
        build solid demandgrowth (higher population levels with a concurrent rise in per capitaincome) to drive a
        buoyant property market in the longer run.<br/><br/>
        Therefore, despite different levels of restrictions on home ownership inthese three cities and the divergent
        impacts on price and volume (Zhuhaiappears to be weakest among the three) in the near term, we believe
        thatoverall market sentiment remains strong. Although more stringenttightening policies since April along with
        tighter mortgage conditions haveresulted in lower sell-through and cash collection ratios, developers arehighly
        confident that the market will be much more resilient in this cycle(mortgage and developers¡¯ financing
        conditions are not as severe as in theprevious downturn) and that any marginal policy loosening could
        stimulatetransactions and price appreciation quickly. Meanwhile, although presaleASP control appears to be
        stringent, the governments in Foshan¡¯s andGuangzhou¡¯s non-core districts allow two contracts (one for the
        propertypurchase to which the ASP control is applied, one for housing decoration),which provides headroom for
        developers¡¯ profitability, especially amidcontinuous soaring land prices in the region. Local governments plan
        toincrease land supply in most GHM cities during 2017-19 from the 2015-16trough levels with a focus on new
        development areas where industrial andinfrastructure upgrades are underway.</p>
