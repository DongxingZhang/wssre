    <p> The BSP kept the reverse repo rate unchanged at 3.00%, as widely expected. In his statementfollowing the
        meeting, BSP governor Nestor Espenilla said that "the current policy settings remainappropriate" given the
        current inflation trajectory and that liquidity in the system remains"adequate" in light of high domestic demand
        (Bloomberg, 21 September). The BSP also said that itwill continue to monitor geopolitical events and policies in
        advanced economies, but also notedthat the impact to the Philippines from the Federal Reserve's recent
        announcement to tighten itsbalance sheet is "likely not significant" (Bloomberg, 21 September). Like in previous
        statements,the BSP also acknowledged that inflation risks are tilted to the upside in light of a proposed
        taxreform by the Duterte Administration that seeks to impose higher excise taxes on fuel.<br/><br/>
        We agree with the BSP that upside risks to inflation remain, given higher oil prices and thelooming tax reform.
        The Senate recently approved their version of the tax reform, which suggeststhat it could be passed in Congress
        and signed by President Duterte before the end of the year(Inquirer, 20 September). However, we believe this not
        reason enough for the BSP to hike rates asthe price hike from the tax reform is likely to be transitory, while
        headline inflation remains nearthe midpoint of the BSP¡¯s 2-4% target band. Moreover, the BSP has little
        incentive to tweak policysettings in the short-term and risk the country's strong economic momentum (See:
        PhilippineCentral Bank Watch, Business as usual, 15 September 2017). We expect the BSP keep its policyrates on
        hold for the remainder of the year</p>
