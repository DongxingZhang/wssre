    <p> 11of our 18surveyed hotels are already fully booked for Oct 1-5th<br/><br/>
        Although Sept GGR is likely to be slow due to lingering typhoon impact, we believethis year's October Golden
        Week will be the busiest holiday in four years. To gaugethe strength of this holiday's demand, we checked online
        bookings for 18hotelsin Macau yesterday. Of the 18hotels we checked, 11hotels are already fullybooked for the
        first 5days of Golden Week, up from 8hotels this time last year. Inparticular, Cotai seems to be grabbing more
        visitor traffic as 6of the 7hotels withmore fully-booked days vs last year are in Cotai. Cotai beneficiaries
        include SandsChina and Galaxy. We reiterate our Buy ratings on Wynn Macau and MGM China.<br/><br/>
        Most hotels charging higher room rates this year<br/><br/>
        Year-to-July, the no. of mainland Chinese overnight visitors has risen sharply (17%yoy). This has allowed 5-star
        hotels to lift average room rate (ADR). In our survey,12of the 18hotels are now charging higher room rates for
        this year's GoldenWeek than last year's. In particular, Sheraton hotel at Sands Cotai Central (Cotai)seems to be
        enjoying the highest ADR increase. Also, all hotels at Galaxy Macau(Cotai) are charging higher ADRs this
        year.<br/><br/>
        Valuation can trade up to 16x on an upcycle<br/><br/>
        Over the past mth, Macau stocks +13% (vs MSCI HK +3%), largely caught up theQTD underperformance vs the index.
        Macau now trades at 14x DB 12m fwd EV/EBITDA, at +1SD over hist avg. Risks mainly relate to regulatory changes.
