    <p> Local UPS king is gaining its power over international peers in China<br/><br/>
        We visited Kstar's SZ UPS factory. The company is upbeat on its UPS marketshare expansion in both China
        (especially on 20kVA+ UPS) and overseas,thanks to its high precision and cost/performance products. We
        feelcomfortable with its 20%+ online UPS sales CAGR in 2017-2020E and 38-40%GPM thanks to favorable product mix
        change (integrated/higher power UPS).We also believe international UPS brands (Riello, Schneider, Emerson)
        willaccelerate their outsourcing to qualified ODMs like Voltronic, given risingcompetition from local kings.
        Voltronic and Kstar are our top picks in GreaterChina UPS fields; we reiterate our Buy ratings on both
        names.<br/><br/>
        Upbeat 2017outlook driven by online UPS/inverter strength<br/><br/>
        Kstar is upbeat on its 2017outlook and targets a 30%+ earnings CAGR in2017-2019E driven by online UPS and
        inverter strength. Propelled by continuedinverter order wins for the Chinese government¡¯s poverty reduction
        projects inrural areas, Kstar expects a 100% YoY inverter revenue increase this year, withGPM ramping to 35-36%
        vs. 30-33% before. For UPS, Kstar expects continuedmarket share expansion in 20kVA+ orders thanks to its R&amp;D;
        strength andpromotion from the Chinese government. Kstar is also offering an integratedUPS solution (battery +
        UPS + high-precision air conditioner) to China¡¯s IDC ,helping drive potential 20%+ online UPS revenue CAGR in
        the next three years.<br/><br/>
        Kstar¡¯s ongoing UPS gain implies rising pressure on international competitors<br/><br/>
        Kstar expects its Chinese UPS market share to ramp up to 20-22% in twoyears¡¯ time, vs. 15-16% currently.
        Management attributes the faster expansionto its take-off in 20kVA+ UPS. By leveraging its good relationship
        with localgovernment (in high-speed railway/governmental projects) and highcost/performance products (10-15%
        lower price vs. international competitors),Kstar continues to gain market share from international peers (e.g.
        Schneider,Emerson) in China. Besides the domestic market, Kstar is promoting its ownbrandproducts in emerging
        countries (e.g. South East Asia) by setting up 10branches overseas. The company believes its good customization
        capabilitiesin small-power UPS manufacturing will help it outperform international brandsin emerging countries
        (lack of power standard) going forward.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We raise our 2017EPS estimate by 12% to factor in stronger UPS/inverterdemand. We lift our TP to RMB18.6from
        RMB16.4as we roll over to one yearFW EPS vs. 2017E EPS before (still based on 30x 2017E P/E, or 1.0x PEG).Risks:
        weaker China UPS demand, price competition, and unfavorable FX.</p>
