        to RMB68.4bn, achieving 51% ofour FY17E revenue forecast. The revenue growth was likely driven by growthand new
        model launches from key OEM customers and good momentum onoverseas business, according to the company.
        Meanwhile, Huayu¡¯s 1H17gross profit grew 12.7% YoY to RMB9.4bn with 15.2bps YoY gross profitmargin improvement.
        Together with 17.4% YoY growth in profit contributionfrom its JVs/associates, but partially offset by 16.5% YoY
        jump in SG&amp;Aexpenses;, 1H17net profit increased by 5.5% YoY to RMB3.2bn, achieving 45%of our FY17E profit
        estimate and 49% of consensus.<br/><br/>
        On a quarterly basis, 2Q17revenue increased by 24.5% YoY to RMB36.8bnand JVs/associates income grew by 33.9% YoY
        to RMB1.1bn. Offset by 24.5%YoY growth in SG&amp;A; expenses due to increasing overseas sales, 2Q17netprofit
        increased by 11.8% YoY to RMB1.8bn.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C attractive valuation with expanding overseas sales<br/><br/>
        We raise our FY17-19E revenue by 2.1-6.2% to reflect slightly better-thanexpected1H17revenue growth. However,
        with lower margin assumptions andJV earnings contribution, we adjust down our FY17-19E earnings forecasts
        by2.5-6.1%. Our TP is based on 10.5x FY18E P/E (unchanged), about 10% belowHuayu¡¯s mid-cycle P/E of 12x. This is
        justified, in our view, as we expect Huayuto deliver a 12.0% FY16-19E three-year net profit CAGR. We think that
        theexpanding overseas sales of its interior trim subsidiary Yanfeng should providean additional growth driver.
        Maintain Buy on attractive FY18E P/E of 9.2x and5.8% dividend yield. Key downside risks: weaker auto sales;
        inability to acquirenew customers; and unexpected increase in raw material prices.</p>
