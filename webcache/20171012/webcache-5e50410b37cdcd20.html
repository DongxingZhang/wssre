    <p> Robust back-to-school points to sustainable demand growth<br/><br/>
        We recently visited selected offline sportswear distributors in Eastern China. For us, back-to-school is
        important as it: (1) hints at autumn season demand, and (2) is traditionally a very profitable season for
        distributors. The acceleration in retail sales YoY that we witnessed is encouraging, after rather muted sales in
        July (mainly due to inventory shortage). We believe Anta was the outperformer and take this opportunity to
        update our model post 1H17 results. We maintain our preference for Anta over Li Ning over Pou Sheng (all Buy
        rated).</p>
