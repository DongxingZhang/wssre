    <p> Expectations of policy relaxation wiped out amid a new round of measurestargeted at controlling housing
        re-sales. Over the weekend, six cities came out withanother round of policy controls, which restrict home
        re-sales, including Chongqing,Nanchang, Nanning, Changsha, Guiyang, and Shijiazhuang. Homeowners aregenerally
        prohibited from re-selling their homes within 2-5 years after obtaining realestate certificates. Xi¡¯an and Wuhan
        also introduced cooling measures on housingASPs and developers¡¯ sales activities. The new measures are targeted
        at furtherenhancing market control to prevent speculation in the housing market, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Timing of the new policies sends a clear message that the government will keepa tight grip on the housing
        market. While our view is that the policy environmentshould remain unchanged, we contend the timing of the new
        policies is somewhatsurprising, given the 19th Party Congress is scheduled for next month. In our view, thisnew
        round of measures provides a clear indication that the government will continueto closely monitor developments
        in the housing market and that cities with persistentlystrong home price growth will be under scrutiny. Indeed,
        NBS data shows that citiesthat have implemented new policies experienced rapid housing ASP growth in August,with
        Changsha and Xi¡¯an registering y-o-y increase of 16.5% and 13.4%, respectively.<br/><br/>
        Reiterate our view that risk appetite could decline towards year-end. Last week,we turned more cautious on
        China¡¯s property sector as we argue that investors shouldtake the opportunity to lock in gains after a
        record-breaking nine months (see ChinaReal Estate ¨C Caution: Entering a period of lower risk appetite, 21
        September 2017).<br/><br/>
        The new measures will likely cool market sentiment and serve to dampen sky-highgrowth expectations. We reiterate
        our cautious tone and advise investors to stayselective. Our preferred names include COLI (688 HK, HKD27.30,
        Buy) as a qualitylaggard, and Longfor (960 HK, HKD21.65, Buy) due to its balanced approach betweenscale and
        profitability. Fundamentally, a key risk to the sector remains tightenedliquidity, which could impact
        developers¡¯ contracted sales momentum.</p>
