    <p> New home sales declined 13% WoW in 26 major cities for the week ended Sep 17,per Soufun data, with 9%, -15% and
        -10% WoW in tier 1, 2 and lower tier citiesrespectively. Tier 1 cities saw positive WoW this week, except
        Shanghai, withabsolute transaction volume wandering at a historical low level of 700+ unitssince August. We
        attribute the sales slowdown in Shanghai mainly to: 1) limitednew launches, due to price cap; 2) government¡¯s
        determination of promotingleasing market development, as indicated by recent accelerated supply ofleasehold
        land, has repel speculative demand to some extent. Weekly sellthroughrate rebounded to 84% vs 76% the previous
        week, driven mainly by therecovered sell-through rate (from 60% to 75%) in tier 1 cities. Meanwhile,
        thesell-trough rate in major tier 2 cities stayed at a strong level of 84%, whichrepresents still upbeat market
        sentiment, although overall transaction volume isunder government control. September MTD sales recorded -20%
        YoY, vs -8% inAugust MTD. In terms of breakdown, tier 1, 2 and lower tier cities recorded -52%, -13% and -21%
        YoY in Sep MTD vs 58%, 6% and -22% YoY in Aug MTDrespectively. We expect mild sales growth and more negative YoY
        in October,due to: 1) a high base, and 2) a supply shortage because of price cap measures.<br/><br/>
        Secondary sales rebound 4% WoW in 11 major cities for the week endedSeptember 17, per Wind data, at 10%, 1% and
        4% WoW in tier 1, 2 and lower tiercities, respectively. September MTD secondary transaction GFA recorded
        -61%YoY, vs -51% YoY in August MTD, with -33%, -21% and -45% YoY in tier 1,2 andlower tier cities, respectively,
        vs -25%, 1% and -33% in August MTD.<br/><br/>
        August NBS data ¨C Growth picked up modestly. August property sales went up2% and 4% in volume and value terms,
        respectively, in August 2017, versus 0%and 4% in July 2017. New starts increased 10% YoY, reversing from
        negativegrowth in July, which is also in line with rebounded REI growth level of 11%YoY inAugust, vs 9% YoY in
        July. Meanwhile, national completed inventories recorded ahistorical low of 332mn sqm since January 2015. We
        expect sales growth todecelerate in Sep/Oct given a higher base, slowdown in lower tier cities andshortage of
        saleable resources. For new starts, we maintain our forecast at +6%for 2017, implying slower YoY growth in new
        starts in 2H17 vs. 1H17 (+15% YoY).</p>
