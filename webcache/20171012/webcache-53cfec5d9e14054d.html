    <p> Tech unwinding concerns waning....<br/><br/>
        We undertook a marketing trip to Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong last week, findingthat while some investors
        have reduced tech stock exposure, most have maintained theirs,based on: 1) expectations of solid profit growth
        and next year¡¯s bright earnings outlook;and 2) concerns of other sectors being more susceptible to regulatory
        and geopolitical risk.<br/><br/>
        Instead of reducing exposure, tech portfolio adjustments seem more probable.<br/><br/>
        ¡­but sector overrepresentation accelerates.<br/><br/>
        Reducing tech exposure aims to defend portfolios from unpredictable market impacts andappears based on the
        perception that such stocks¡ªas they are held by too manyinvestors¡ªseem unlikely to outperform. Conversely, some
        investors try to hedge risk byincreasing exposure to memory stocks that have seen rapid advancements of late.
        Insteadof being 2018 portfolio rebalancing, we believe the moves are instead aimed at takingadvantage of solid
        earnings momentum expected at year-end and fewer-than-usualnegatives during low season. Many investors foresee
        near-term upward revisions toconsensus estimates, with those in Taiwan interested in small memory makers like
        NanyaTechnology and Winbond.<br/><br/>
        Overall solid 2018 outlook.<br/><br/>
        By and large, investors have a positive 2018 industry outlook, which anticipates continualbig data-related
        investments. Still, some have tired of incessant talk surrounding thesubject, pointing out that: 1) cloud
        computing was conceived to reduce the investmentburden of individual companies and thereby enhance efficiency;
        but 2) cloud providersand customers are both investing on their terms, which some may say is excessive¡ªas thisis
        somewhat counterintuitive to the concept of clouding, where individual firms rentservers, thus raising concerns
        of ICT investments contracting once cloud computing¡¯sinfrastructure has expanded sufficiently. Indeed, such
        concerns may not be overblownsince cloud utilization rates are below 50%, with the unused portion continuously
        beingupgraded. Still, most investors agree that the investment cycle remains nascent, withslowing demand merely
        a risk.</p>
