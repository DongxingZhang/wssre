    <p> New issue from KWG<br/><br/>
        KWG (issuer rating of B1/B+/BB- by Moody¡¯s/S&amp;P;/Fitch respectively, withstable outlook) announced earlier
        today a 5NC3USD bond for refinancingpurposes, with Bloomberg reporting the IPT to be 5.6% area. Since about
        1.5-2years ago, KWG management has started to become less conservative inlandbanking and expansion, which has
        led to high leverage; having said that,the proactive landbanking should underpin a better growth path, with
        robustsaleable resources and good EBITDA growth for the next few years, in ourview. The company is a seasoned
        China HY issuer, with attributable landbankof about 15.67mn sq m as of August. Year-to-August, KWG acquired
        13sites,of which 10were via M&amp;A.; We like the developer¡¯s strong margins (facilitatedby still some vintage
        landbank in Tier-1and 2cities with low land cost),diversified landbank, and a good mix of property type
        (residential, office, retailand hotels), but reckon its leverage is high. There is also potential to unlockasset
        value via en-bloc office sales. KWG has various well-located officebuildings across a number of cities including
        Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhouand Beijing which could unlock some asset value. Its staff partnership schemecould
        help to align some incentives with employees, which we see as apositive move to improve the company¡¯s future
        growth.</p>
