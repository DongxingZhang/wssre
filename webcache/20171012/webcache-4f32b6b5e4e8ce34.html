        Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, likely to continue gradual interest rate hikes, despiteweak inflation. She acknowledged
        the Fed may have been slightly inaccuratein forecasting inflation and is even open to pull back from a rate
        hike, ifinflation dynamics change. However, she noted it would be ¡°imprudent¡± tokeep monetary policy on hold
        until inflation reaches 2%, as an overheatedlabor market could create inflationary problem triggering recession.
