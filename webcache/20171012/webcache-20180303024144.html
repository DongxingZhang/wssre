    <p> Focus on higher real rates and higher yields<br/><br/>
        We continue to favor higher real rates that are supported by domesticfundamentals (BoP and inflation) and - in
        credit - curve trades and higher yieldingsovereigns with an overall neutral stance. USD weakness - not carry -
        has been themain determinant of EM FX performance. BoP, real rates, and economic upturnssupport BRL and RUB
        longs. We expect CBT to continue to anchor TRY longs, butwe find it more sensitive to possible bouts of USD
        strength. The post-earthquakeMXN selloff should retrace given its limited economic impact. In rates, we
        favorreceivers where positioning is lighter and monetary dynamics/pricing/carry mostfavorable. We keep
        high-conviction Russia longs via OFZ and bull steepening inXCCY, Israel (forward-starting) and Poland (2Y2Y
