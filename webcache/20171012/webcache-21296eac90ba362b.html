    <p> Following our note on ICICI Prudential Life (see link to our report), we havereceived a number of queries around
        protection market share in India. While wedon¡¯t have clear data around overall protection premiums, insurers in
        India dodisclose sum assured on the new business (a good proxy on protection businessin our view). In this note,
        we have tried to compare market share of variousplayers in overall new business premiums to that of new sum
        assured(protection) over the past five years - see the chart below. Our key observationsare as follows:a)
        Private players are much more focused on protection compared to LIC andhave a market share on new sum assured at
        77% vs. 49% in overall new businesspremiums (APE basis) during F17.<br/><br/>
        b) Over the past five years, private players have increased their protectionmarket share on new business by
        ~21%pts to 77%. This compares to market sharegains of ~10%pts in overall new business premiums to 49% during the
        sameperiod.</p>
