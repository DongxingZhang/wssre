    <p> SIAC's pax growth slowed to 1.2% YoY in Aug-17, from 4.1% in Jul-17: Thisreflects weakness in domestic routes
        (-1.8% vs. +5.9%). However, we still seeimprovement in SIAC's traffic mix, given relatively stronger growth
        ininternational (4.4% vs. 2.7%) and regional routes (2.5% vs. 0.5%). In 8M17,aggregate pax throughput grew 5.4%
        YoY, lower than 10.0% in 8M16.<br/><br/>
        Aircraft traffic was flat YoY in Aug-17, after +2.9% in Jul-17: (Average pax peraircraft: 148 in Aug-17 vs. 146
        in Jul-17). Weakness was found in domestic (-5.1% vs.<br/><br/>
        +0.9%) and regional routes (-3.8% vs. -3.7%), while international momentumpicked up slightly (7.5% vs. 7.3%),
        reflecting capacity reallocations by SIAC amidthe Civil Aviation Administration of China's penalty on slot
        additions. YTD,aircraft movement growth normalized to 3.2% YoY, from 7.7% in 8M16.<br/><br/>
        Cargo/mail volume growth remained robust at 12.1% YoY in Aug-17, vs. 12.6% inJul-17: It was mainly driven by
        strong international momentum (16.7% vs. 16.6%).<br/><br/>
        Domestic volume declined 6.6% YoY (vs. -0.9% in Jul-17), while regional growthstrengthened to 3.6% YoY (vs. 0.8%
        in Jul-17). In 8M17, volume growthaccelerated significantly to 13.3% YoY, from 2.0% in 8M16.<br/><br/>
        CAAC penalty update: According to CAAC official news on August 31, 2017,approval of temporary flights, chartered
        flights and new route applications bySIAC will continue to cease until December 31, 2017, due to low
        punctuality.<br/><br/>
        However, SIAC is allowed to reallocate its existing flight capacity tointernational/regional routes from
        domestic ones.</p>
