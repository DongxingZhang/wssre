    <p> While we anticipated that Stanley Fischer would likely resign once his term as ViceChair expired in June 2018,
        yesterday¡¯s announcement of his resignation effectivein mid-October came as a real surprise to us. We take him
        at his word that he hasimportant personal reasons for leaving early. With his departure, the Board andthe FOMC
        will lose a most prominent macroeconomist, with a wealth of expertisein monetary policy, international
        economics, and first-hand experience leadinga central bank during a financial crisis. Below, we detail several
        implications ofFischer¡¯s early resignation.<br/><br/>
        The ¡°core¡± of the Committee has lost one of its more hawkish members<br/><br/>
        Fischer has been a consistent force on the Board of Governors that has advocatedfor the median or ¡°consensus¡±
        Fed view of a continued ¡°gradual¡± normalizationof monetary policy. This view has hinged on the fact that current
        monetary policyremains accommodative and that, with the unemployment rate expected to fallfurther below NAIRU,
        inflation should move upward towards the Fed¡¯s target overtime. According to this view, failure to continue to
        tighten in at least a gradualmanner could tilt the balance of risks toward a significant inflation overshoot
        inthe future. That is, Fischer has supported the continued validity of the Phillipscurve framework for
        forecasting inflation and used this to guide his monetarypolicy expectations.<br/><br/>
        In this role, Fischer has been consistently more hawkish than other core membersincluding Yellen and Dudley. He
        has also been generally less concerned aboutinflation falling modestly below the Fed¡¯s 2% inflation objective.
        For example, inMarch 2016, with core PCE inflation around 1.7%, Fischer noted that he believedthat the Fed was
        ¡°not that far away¡± from its inflation goal.1This view on inflationwould be critical in the upcoming debate
        about when to next raise rates in thepresence of a string of softer inflation prints.<br/><br/>
        December rate hike odds should fall at the margin<br/><br/>
        In the absence of convincing evidence that inflation has firmed following therecent spell of soft inflation
        prints, the December rate hike decision is setting up tobe contentious. A number of Fed officials have voiced
        concern about low inflationand caution about whether it will return towards the Fed¡¯s target, includingBrainard,
        Evans, Kaplan and Kashkari. In a close call, it is possible that there couldbe at least three and possibly even
        four dissents to a December rate hike decision.We still believe that the Fed will hike rates in December if the
