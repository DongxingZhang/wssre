    <p> In this note, we take stock of risks to headline inflation over the coming months fromeach of its major
        components ¨C core, fuel and food.<br/><br/>
        Weakness in manufacturing stood out the most in the latest GDP print. A part of itcould be due to inventory
        drawdown in the run-up to the GST and could reverse soon.<br/><br/>
        However, small- and medium-sized enterprises are believed to have been hit a littleharder, especially by a
        working capital squeeze, due to delays in tax refunds. Supplyfrom their end is likely to remain constrained
        until the input tax credit mechanism startsfunctioning in full swing. Hence, an inadequate supply-side response
        from a weakmanufacturing sector could translate into higher core inflation over the coming months.<br/><br/>
        The recent increase in global crude prices, possibly due to supply constraints as well,poses further upside
        risks to domestic fuel costs, especially when the pass-through toconsumer prices has become rather easy due to
        the newly implemented daily priceadjustment mechanism.<br/><br/>
        But food prices alone can save the day. After spiking in August, they fell once again inSeptember, particularly
        vegetable prices, which are cooling rapidly. If vegetable pricesremain benign over the coming months, due to a
        normal monsoon and ongoing foodsupply management reforms, low food inflation could offset the upside risks
        emanatingfrom core and fuel, keeping the headline in the ballpark of the 4% RBI target.<br/><br/>
        Looking through short-term disruptions from recently implemented structural reforms,we believe underlying
        inflation will remain around 4%. Another way of saying this isthat the RBI has met its inflation target in
        record time and is unlikely to move oneither side in terms of policy actions, i.e. we expect it to keep rates
        unchanged for theforeseeable future.<br/><br/>
        However, there are faint risks of a 25bp cut towards the end of the fiscal year, only ifheadline inflation
        continues to undershoot the 4% target by a comfortable marginover the remaining FY18. This could happen if the
        fall in food prices is sharper thanexpected, or if the demand-supply gap reduces due to lower current
        incomestranslating into lower consumption demand over the coming quarters, thereby easingpressure on core prices
        as well.</p>
