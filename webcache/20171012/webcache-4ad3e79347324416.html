    <p> Consumer prices increased 2.6% y-o-y in August, notably accelerating from 2.2%in July and surprising the market
        on the upside. However, we note that fasterinflation was largely due to a 18% y-o-y jump in fresh food prices
        and somepositive base effect from lower utility prices last year. Indeed, underlying pricesmeasures remained
        stable. The central bank's preferred measure of core inflation,excluding food and energy prices, actually
        decelerated to 1.4% y-o-y in Augustafter staying at 1.5% y-o-y for three straight months. We expect headline
        inflationto decelerate in 4Q17, as the base effect in energy prices washes out.<br/><br/>
        The headline consumer price index (CPI) increased 2.6% y-o-y (HSBC: 2.3, BBG: 2.2) inAugust, accelerating
        notably from 2.2% in July and marking the highest level of growth sinceearly 2012. Seasonally adjusted by HSBC,
        CPI increased 0.3% m-o-m sa in August, followinga similar gain in July.<br/><br/>
        Headline price gains were largely driven by a sharp rise in fresh food prices, reflectingunfavourable weather
        conditions. Indeed, prices of fresh foods increased 18.3% y-o-y (or+3.3% m-o-m sa) in August, led largely by
        vegetable and fruit prices. Meanwhile, the baseeffect from energy prices also contributed to y-o-y price gains
        due to temporary electricitytariff cuts in 3Q17 last year.<br/><br/>
        Excluding food and energy prices, the BoK's preferred measure of core CPI remained largelyunchanged,
        decelerating to 1.4% y-o-y in August after staying at 1.5% for the previous threemonths. Core CPI, excluding
        agriculture and oil prices, was also kept unchanged at 1.8% y-o-y(HSBC: 1.7, BBG: 1.8) in August. Indeed,
        service prices are showing few signs ofaccelerating, in both public and private services.</p>
