    <p> Kinross will proceed with both the long-awaited Phase 2 (P2) of Tasiast(Mauritania), as well as Phase W at Round
        Mountain (Nevada). P2 expansionwill transform Tasiast into a large, low-cost, operation with a 10+ years of
        minelife. Phase One (P1) was initiated in 1Q16 for ~$300m and is now ~66%completed and on-track for commercial
        production in 2Q18. P2 will see milloutput to increase by 18ktpd to a combined capacity of 30ktpd and
        productionaveraging 812koz/year in the first five years. Cost of sales estimated at $440/ozand AISC $655/oz.
        Kinross expects strong free cash flow of ~$2.2bn over thelife of mine. Management expressed confidence in its
        relationship withMauritanian authorities who have been supportive following Kinross¡¯s 7-yeartrack record of
        operating in the country and increasing local hires.<br/><br/>
        The construction of P2 should begin early 2018, after P1 commissioning. Initialplant and infrastructure capital
        costs have been lowered to $590m comparedto Pre-Feasibility estimate at $620m due to operational efficiencies
        (improvedthroughput at existing mill). P2 includes: 1) the replacement of the two currentball mills with a new
        larger ball mill, 2) new leaching, thickening and refinerycapacity additions to the mining fleet, and 3) new
        power plant. Commercialproduction expected in 3Q20. The combined P1 and P2 non-sustainingcapitalized stripping
        costs estimated to reach $560m and remaining $370m tobe spent from 2018 through 1H20. P1¡¯s IRR at ~20% with a
        Net Present Valueof $635m (post-tax), P2¡¯s incremental IRR is estimated at 24% and the Two-Phased project
        combined Net Present Value is $1.43bn (after-tax) usingdiscount rate of 5%, gold price of $1,200/oz and oil
        price of $55/bbl. While theinitial combined NPV was estimated at $885m and P2¡¯s IRR at 15%, estimateshave
        improved based on positive processing enhancements at the mine.<br/><br/>
        Kinross will also develop the Phase W at Round Mountain, pending completionof the permitting process (expected
        by year-end). Phase W will extend miningby five years (2020 through 2024) and increase mine life production by
        1.5Moz.<br/><br/>
        Capex are currently estimated at $230m and include the layback of the currentpit and construction of a new
        Carbon in Column (CI) plant and heap leach pad(completion by 2Q19). Capitalized stripping expenses to reach
        $215m andstripping starting early 2018. Production to be sustained at ~341koz at costs of~$765/oz and AISC
        $905/oz despite initial low grade Phase W ore until mid-2019. With incremental cash flow of $265m, Phase W
        should deliver IRR of13% and NPV of $135m (after-tax) (same assumptions than P2).<br/><br/>
        Company forecasts pro-forma liquidity of $2.5bn, with cash balance of $1.1bn,along with an available line of
        credit of $1.4bn. Kinross has no debt maturitiesuntil 2021 and both projects expected to be funded with
        internally-generatedcash. ~$930m of combined incremental NPV from P2 and W compare favorablyto Kinross¡¯s market
        cap of $5.6bn (+16%), but worth noting are based on 5.0%project discount rates applied uniformly to both
        Mauritania and Nevada. Weestimate ~15% lower NPV for each 1pp increase in discount rate applied.</p>
