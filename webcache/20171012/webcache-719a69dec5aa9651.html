    <p> Europe - Focus Europe - Mark Wall<br/><br/>
        After a rather uninspiring campaign Germany is going to the polls this weekend.Only during the brief period of
        the Schulz hype at the beginning of the year didthere seem to be some real suspense emerging. Pretty soon it
        become clear thatChancellor Merkel would almost certainly garner her fourth term. Still, lots ofthings are up in
        the air with respect to German politics over the next four years,including the strength of Merkel¡¯s mandate and
        her choice of coalition partner.<br/><br/>
        Europe - SIREN - Peter Sidorov<br/><br/>
        Both SIREN Momentum and Surprise improved on the back of positive Q3datareleases this week, especially the flash
        September PMIs, with SIREN Surpisereaching its highest level since March. The euro area PMI surprised strongly
        tothe upside in the September flash reading, with the composite index up 1ptto 56.7(exp. 55.6), just below the
        cyclical highs seen in the spring. The risewas seen in both sectors, with manufacturing reaching new cyclical
        highs, ledby Germany. However, the flash PMIs implied a services-driven fall of almost1pt in the periphery.
        Elsewhere September German ZEW improved more thanexpected (17vs 12mkt. exp). Among hard data releases we had the
        July euroarea construction improving by 0.2% mom. The improvement was broad basedacross euro area countries
        except for Netherlands and Belgium.<br/><br/>
