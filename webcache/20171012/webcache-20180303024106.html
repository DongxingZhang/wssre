    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +4.3%. Weekly loadings up 3.1%¡£<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 4.3% in Week#35(ended 08/26/2017) vs. a 3.9%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 0.8%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 3.1% YoY (versus a 3.6%
        increase in the priorweek) and increased 0.3% sequentially (vs. a 0.5% decrease in the prior week).¡£<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices down 1c/gal to 25c/gal. Propane up 4c/gal to 80c/gal¡£<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices were down 1c/gal last week to 25c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has
        declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston.
        Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/fundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from
        thestart-up of 8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade toward
        its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue, with the premium reflecting fractionation, transportation
        and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate ethane prices will
        move toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.¡£<br/><br/>
        Propane prices rose 4c/gal last week to 80c/gal. While propane inventorieswere up 2% last week to 73.5MM bbls,
        they are 18% and 10% below theirand 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventories
        todecline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).¡£<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene up 1c/lb 26c/lb. Margins up 1.5c/lb to 10.5c/lb¡£<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices increased 1c/lb last week to 26c/lb (vs the July contractprice of 29.25c/lb). Spot deals
        for August ranged between 25.5-26c/lb withdeals for September delivery ranged between 27.5-27.75c/lb. Average
        spotethylene margins expanded 1.5c/lb last week to 10.5c/lb on higher sellingprices and lower naphtha and
        ethane.¡£<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forAugust delivery ranged between
        41-42c/lb. August propylene contract pricessettled up 0.5c/lb at 39.5c/lb for PG and 38.0c/lb for chemical
        grade.Propylene prices, which had risen 21c/lb, or 68% (for PG), from December toMarch, fell 14c/lb, or 27%, in
        April/May due to improving refinery-basedsupply. After rolling over flat in June and a 0.5c/lb increase in July,
        Augustcontracts settled higher driven by less-than-expected supply levels due todelayed start-up of the new
        Enterprise PDH unit .¡£<br/><br/>
        3% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in September¡£<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, more than 50% of the US ethylene capacity is currently offline asresult of Hurricane Harvey¡¯s landfall
        in Texas, with most of the shutdowns dueto flooding or loss of power. Nova Chemical¡¯s Sarnia, Ont cracker (2% of
        NorthAmerican {NA} ethylene capacity) and Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NAethylene capacity) will be
        offline in September under planned turnaround work.For ¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 3.5B
        lbs, or 4.1%, ofcapacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or4.1%, of
        ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.¡£</p>
