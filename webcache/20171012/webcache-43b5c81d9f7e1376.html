    <p> We visited companies in the augmented reality (AR) supply chain in China,including brand makers, optical
        modules, micro displays, chipsets and EMS.<br/><br/>
        We also tried several new AR glasses and reaffirm our confidence in the growingAR trend and technology upgrading
        in China. With Apple launching its newiPhone equipped with AR functions, we expect more technology giants to
        followsuit. Compared to VR, we expect AR to enjoy a larger market potential given it isless disruptive for end
        users (as there no need to restrict vision and can be usedin fragmented time, and it can be embedded in
        smartphones or stand-alone ARheadsets). IDC expects the AR headset market to grow at a 198% CAGR in2016-21E to
        US$49bn (see beneficiaries in Figs 1 and 2).<br/><br/>
        Optical modules are crucial to AR glasses, as they determine image quality, fieldof view (FoV), distance of the
        projected digital information from the end users¡¯eyes, the size of the projected virtual screen, the
        combination/alliance of digitalinformation and the real world, etc. Mainstream optical solutions
        includediffraction grating, prism, freeform and waveguide, with the latter two solutionsfeaturing larger FoV and
        fewer difficulties in mass production. Sunny Opticallens + modules) and ASMPT (CIS/AA/3D sensing equipment) are
        our top picks.<br/><br/>
        Beijing NED+AR, a private company in which Lenovo Capital invested Rmb10m+in Jan 2017, is a leading AR optical
        module supplier in China specialising infreeform, with clients such as Google, Meta, Lenovo, Huawei, ZTE and
        Hiscene.<br/><br/>
        Micro displays present the virtual images for the optical module to project outand combine with the real world.
        Current production is dominated by a global-tiersupplier, and we see more Chinese panel makers adding capacity.
        BOE(000725 CH, Rmb4, Neutral, TP: Rmb3.7, Louis Cheng), Yunnan North Olightek(833932 CH, NR), Kopin (10% holding
        by Goertek) and Yunnan IndustryDevelopment invested Rmb1.2bn (US$176m) in Aug 2017 to form the first OLEDmicro
        display mass volume production line in China. We expect the resulting 1munit annual capacity expansion to lower
        the BOM costs of AR glasses,supporting expansion of AR glasses to the consumer market from thecommercial market.<br/><br/>
        We are seeing an increasing number of Chinese AR glasses brands, withleading names enjoying annual shipments of
        ~5,000-10,000 units and ASP40-60% below that of global peers. The lower costs are mainly due to in-houseoptical
        module design and self-developed algorithms, the most vital componentsof AR glasses. The market for Chinese AR
        glasses brands includes bothenterprises and consumers. For enterprises, the primary uses are in
        education,industry, tourism and cultural activities. Consumer uses are mainly in videostreaming and gaming.
        However, we expect AR will go beyond video andgaming to enhance people¡¯s lives with new applications in tourism,
        education,medicine, shopping and e-commerce. With tech giants joining the camp and iOS11 released in
        mid-September, adding AR capabilities to iPhone SE/6s/6s+/7/7+,iPad Pro and iPad 2017, we expect more consumers
        to experience AR,stimulating demand.<br/><br/>
