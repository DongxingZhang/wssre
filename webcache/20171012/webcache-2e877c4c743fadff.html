    <p> Current account returns to surplus in Q2。<br/><br/>
        The central bank reported today that the current account returned to a surplus lastquarter, albeit a tiny one of
        USD15mn. This follows a deficit of USD248mn in Q1(smaller than previously reported) and the largest deficit in
        nine years of USD1.0bnin the final quarter of last year. Today's figure actually exceeded, slightly,
        ourexpectations, but we think supports our view that the worst is behind for thecurrent account. We expect a
        surplus of 1% of GDP this year and 2.0% next year.。<br/><br/>
        Within the details of the report, merchandise exports continue to grow at a healthydouble-digit pace, as the
        customs data had already told us. Exports rose 14%yoy,only mildly weaker than Q1's 15.6% rate. Imports are
        growing at a similar pace,so the trade balance was broadly stable at a deficit of USD7.5bn. Services
        exportssimilarly grew only very slightly slower than in the previous quarter, 6.7%yoyversus 7.1%, and in line
        with expectations. But services imports fell 2.3%yoy,which was the main source of the positive surprise in the
        current account figuretoday. Lastly, on the current account side, incomes and transfers rose 7.5%yoy,by a narrow
        margin the fastest growth since at least 2005, but consistent withour expectations that strengthening growth
        abroad would yield a faster pace ofremittance growth.。<br/><br/>
        The government last week reported July export growth of 10.4%, exactly as we'dforecast, but a decline in imports
        of 3.2% which was again much lower than we'dforecast. As a result, the trade deficit fell to USD1.6bn, the
        lowest in 17months.The improvement in the trade balance over the past year has been the moststriking aspect of
        the Philippine external accounts. Curiously, this hasn't beenmatched by an improvement in the balance of
        payments measure of the tradeto the same extent. Unlike most other countries, the Philippine customs importare
        reported fob not cif, so the difference is puzzling. It has been suggested byothers that the improving trade
        surplus reflects mis-reporting of trade flows, buta comparison with trade partner data shows that whereas in the
        past there havebeen large differences between the Philippines' measure of the trade balance andthat obtained by
        looking at trade partner data, that is no longer materially the case.。<br/><br/>
        While the Philippines has, for at least the post-GFC period, run trade deficits, thecurrent account balance was
        until very recently usually in surplus. That's becausethe balance of trade in services has been positive and
        offshore worker remittanceshave provided a consistent inflow of nearly 9% of GDP each year.。</p>
