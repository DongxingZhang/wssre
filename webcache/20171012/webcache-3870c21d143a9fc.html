    <p> GGR in 2H is usually 10% higher than in 1H。<br/><br/>
        QTD, Macau stocks have underperformed MSCI HK by 10ppt as 2Q results mostlymissed expectations. Of the
        5companies reported, only Wynn delivered both GGR&amp; EBITDA qoq growth. On 30Aug, we think Galaxy will be the
        next one to deliverboth GGR &amp; EBITDA qoq growth. Recently, local checks told us that more smalljunkets are
        expanding footprints (Fig 4). e.g. Galaxy Macau just opened a VIP roomfor David junket in August. Historically,
        2H is the high season with GGR typically10% above that in 1H. But consensus seems to be too conservative,
        forecasting2H17EBITDA to be merely 1% above 1H17. We think Wynn and Galaxy have thestrongest consensus upgrade
        potential (Fig 20). Our 2H17F EBITDA for Wynn &amp;Galaxy; is 12% above consensus. Top pick Wynn.。<br/><br/>
        2Q17wrap: Wynn the biggest beneficiary in this Macau recovery。<br/><br/>
        Five of the 6Macau gaming operators had reported 2Q results. Key takeaways:<br/><br/>
        (1) In the 2Q low season, Macau GGR slipped 1% qoq as VIP (roll +4% qoq)did not grow enough to offset the
        seasonal softness in mass (Mass GGR -4%qoq).<br/><br/>
        (2) Cotai continued to gain share, esp in the mass market.<br/><br/>
        (3) Competitionsremained largely disciplined - Promotional allowances (comps) rose from 10% ofMass GGR in 1H16to
        11% in 2H16after Wynn &amp; Sands openings, but remainedlargely flattish in 1H17. That said, Cotai casino comps
        are noticeably higher thanPeninsula (11% vs 9% of Mass GGR), which may become a problem when moreCotai casinos
        open. Thankfully, other cost items such as junket commissions andlabour costs had remained stable (Figure
        24).。<br/><br/>
        2H17outlook: GGR growth slows, but not as much as the market fears。<br/><br/>
        Consensus is expecting a sharp slowdown in GGR momentum from 29% yoy inJuly to 12% yoy in Aug-Dec. While we
        agree that GGR growth will slow giventougher comps, we think it will only slow to 17% yoy in Aug-Dec. We're
        morebullish than the Street because we¨ve learnt from junkets that China's Tier-3cities are minting new VIPs as
        the "Shanty Town Reimbursement Plan" has beenpropping up property prices in Tier-3cities. Recall that Macau's
        VIP GGR is mostlycorrelated to Tier-3city property prices (75% correlation Figure 6) , and not toTier-1city
        property prices (Figure 5).。<br/><br/>
        Valuation now more reasonable after pullback; key risks。<br/><br/>
        We value Macau stocks on SOTP with target multiples on 2017e EV/EBITDA.Downside risks: a sharp slowdown in GGR
        momentum, a change in investorpreference from momentum stocks to value stocks and regulatory changes.Upside
        risks: milder-than-expected tightening of China's macro credit policy.。</p>
