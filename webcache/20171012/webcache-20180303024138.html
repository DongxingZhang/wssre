    <p> Ready to capture the rising WPC adoption in both iPhone and Android phones<br/><br/>
        Sunway delivered solid 2Q17results and kept 2017EPS guidance (100%+ YoYgrowth) unchanged. Sunway is positive
        about the 2018outlook and identifiesthree key catalysts: 1) ASP increase for iPhone components; 2) market
        sharegain in Samsung three-in-one module; and 3) the rising adoption of wirelesspower charging (WPC) on both
        iPhone and Android camp. Maintain Buy rating.<br/><br/>
        In-line 2Q17results: strong YoY growth continues<br/><br/>
        Sunway reported 2Q17EPS of RMB0.2(+109% YoY; -7% QoQ) and operatingprofit of RMB156m (+54% YoY; -5% QoQ) on
        sales of RMB714m (+73% YoY;<br/><br/>
        flat QoQ). Sales missed market expectations by ~10%, due to soft iPhonedemand and some project delays from
        Chinese clients. However, GPM rose3ppt QoQ to 32.7% (vs. market expectations for 31-32%), owing to
        improvedproduct yields. Propelled by a higher non-op gain (government subsidiary andequity investment income),
        EPS came in 4% above consensus.<br/><br/>
        Positive 2H17/2018outlook: ASP increase, market share gain and WPC<br/><br/>
        For iPhone antenna, due to a key design change (placing Wi-Fi/BT antenna ontop of a supporting frame of dual
        cam), ASP could increase to USD2.5+ (upfrom USD1.5for legacy iPhone antenna). For Samsung¡¯s WPC/NFC/MSTmodule
        (ASP of USD4+), Sunway expects its market share to grow from 10-15% in 2016to 25-30% in 2017and further to
        40-50% in 2018. To cope withthe strong order increase, Sunway is now evaluating if it should set up afactory in
        Korea (dedicated for Samsung) and could finalize this decision inSep. For iPhone¡¯s WPC module, Sunway missed the
        2017project, but see afair chance that it can be a qualified supplier of this module for new iPhones in2018. In
        the Android camp, Chinese OEMs (Huawei, Xiaomi, etc.) are keen onadopting WPC modules (ASP of USD2+) in their
        2018flagship devices.Sunway believes that it will be the primary WPC module supplier for ChineseOEMs, given its
        first-mover advantage and solid relationship with them.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        We raise our 2018/19EPS forecasts by 2% and increase our target price fromRMB40to RMB45. Our new target price is
        still based on 35x PER (but rollingover from 2017-18average EPS to 2018EPS) or 0.8x PEG, which is in line
        withregional peers. Risks: order allocation loss on i-devices; severe pricecompetition; and global smartphone
        weakness.</p>
