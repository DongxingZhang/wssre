    <p> DB¡¯s view ¨C Downstream channel expansion continues<br/><br/>
        As per the company announcement, the current valuation of Maoyan is atRMB13.67n. Note that previous Valuation of
        Maoyan stood at RMB8.3bn.<br/><br/>
        As Enlight Media has strong presence in upstream movie production anddistribution; and Maoyan/Weying is the
        leading online ticketing platform.The investment in Maoyan offers Enlight Media direct channel access tomovie
        viewers.<br/><br/>
        In addition, Weying focuses not only movie ticketing platform, but alsoticketing business for
        show/exhibition/sports events. As of 2016, itsticketing business covered a total of over 2,000theater/exhibition
        hall/stadium.<br/><br/>
        However, we believe that the profitability of online ticketing businessis still low. Note that Maoyan generated
        RMB1bn revenue and net lossof RMB109m in 2016, while its bottomline turns positive in 5M17bydelivering revenue
        of RMB1bn and net profit of RMB73m (implies netmargin of 7%) per company disclosure.<br/><br/>
        As the listco Enlight Media only holds 20% stake in Maoyan, we believethe near-term financial impact is still
        minimum.</p>
