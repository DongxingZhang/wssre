    <p> Rates have re-dipped into loss-making territory<br/><br/>
        Shanghai Shipping Exchange just released container rates for the week endedSept 22. SCFI composite this week
        plunged another 5% WoW to 736, which wasthe largest drop over the past six months. This composite has been
        falling eightweeks in a row and collectively has dropped 18% since early Aug. YoY, SCFI hasalso turned to
        negative this month, which was the first time since Sept 2016. Inlight of both sequential and YoY decline in
        this composite, history suggests thatcontainer stocks are highly likely to retreat. By routes, after falling 17%
        in lastthree weeks, Asia-Europe container rates slashed another 4.6% WoW this weekto USD734/TEU, at which we see
        it difficult for most lines to make money. Asia-USWC container rates, after a brief rise last week, resumed a
        downtrend, fallingas much as 6.4% WoW to USD1,484/FEU as lines reduced rates in order to securecargoes. As SCFI
        has dropped 20% since July, the 3Q peak season earnings arehighly likely to miss market's bullish expectations,
        in our view. And given thetough demand outlook and rising newbuild supplies, we see a high chance thatthe
        industry will re-dip into red in the coming 4Q.<br/><br/>
        Cloudier outlook: falling demand, rising new supplies, and returning megavessel orders<br/><br/>
        On the demand side, 3Q peak season demand was largely muted. Our channelchecks with SME exporters suggest that
        that RMB appreciation, rising rawmaterials costs, and closure of factories will heavily weigh on container
        volumesin coming months. In addition, triggered by the latest new orders from CMA CGMand MSC, we are concerned
        that lines may again start chasing mega vessels,leading to prolonged downcycle.<br/><br/>
        Reiterate Sell on Cosco Shipping and OOIL<br/><br/>
        We use P/B method to value shipping companies due to the cyclical nature ofshipping industry. We reiterate Sell
        on Cosco Shipping given the tough sectoroutlook. Our target price is HK$1.8, based on 0.8x forward P/B. This
        stock looksexpensive at current 1.9x P/B. We also rate OOIL a Sell with target price of HK$45.6based on 0.8x
        2017E P/B. Key risks for Cosco Shipping:<br/><br/>
        (1) stronger-thanexpectedglobal trade and<br/><br/>
        (2) stronger-than-expected merger synergies of OOIL.Key upside risk for OOIL is higher rates and profitability
        drive a higher offer pricefor OOIL by Cosco/SIPG.</p>
