    <p> Bullish view #1<br/><br/>
        We are optimistic about market performance in Sept, but we continue to believe that thiswill be a ¡°slow bull¡±
        market. News that came out over the weekend mainly painted apositive picture: the CPI and PPI came in higher
        than expected, which should be a positivefor the market; the Rmb has strengthened strongly, and its appreciation
        momentumremains despite the PBoC¡¯s cooling measures; the regulator¡¯s recent denouncement ofbitcoins will help
        drive more liquidity to go into the stock market. That said, resourcesstocks might be a cause for concern, as
        the drops in non-ferrous and ferrous metal futuresmight represent some negativity for the underlying sectors.
        The news about ¡°a timetablefor phasing out oil-fueled vehicles¡± that came out over the weekend was a surprise ¨C
        thenew energy vehicles industry chain is likely to experience a rally this week. We believethe iPhone 8to be
        launched on Sept 12will be a significant market focus. The Sept-Octtraditional peak season is under way, and we
        maintain our view that the SHCOMP is likelyto reach the 3,500mark around the 19th CPC national
        congress.<br/><br/>

        <br/><br/>
        The market might fluctuate upwards in Sept. We suggest increasing stock positionmoderately given that
        maintaining stability is the key market tone at the moment.However, we remain cautious about 4Q17, as quarterly
        earnings growth might deceleratein 4Q17due to the high base effect. We prefer new energy vehicles, the Apple
        (AAPL US,NR) supply chain, non-ferrous and steel.<br/><br/>
        Bullish view #3<br/><br/>
        The market has rebounded recently with an increased trading volume, which indicatesthat investor sentiment has
        continued to improve. In terms of fundamentals, economicdata declined across the board in July, but in Aug the
        monthly PMI and industry data suchas heavy duty truck sales came in much better than market expected. It is now
        fullyexpected by the market that any declines in economic data in 2H17should be mild andmanageable. Continued
        Rmb appreciation has also boosted market confidence. Inparticular, the fact that the date of the widely followed
        19th CPC national congress hasbeen fixed has largely removed all political uncertainties. The financial
        regulatoryenvironment should be relatively benign prior to the CPC meeting, meaning a surprisecontraction in
        stock market liquidity is unlikely to happen. The market is likely to movefurther up with fluctuations before
        the 19th CPC national congress, though investorsshould not hold overly high hopes for the scale of the market
        rebound considering thateach major sector has essentially experienced a rotation of share price strength
        recently.Restrictions on industrial production led by environmental regulation are bound to betougher in
        2H17compared with last year, and we suggest focusing on cyclical sectorssuch as non-ferrous, steel, chemical,
        building materials and papermaking, as well as thefinancial sector while their share prices are still at a
        relatively low level. Meanwhile, wehighlight the impact of Rmb appreciation on the airlines and papermaking
        sectors. The SME and ChiNext boards, especially solid growth stocks from the TMT sector, might be even
        morenoteworthy in the near future. In addition, stocks related to chips &amp; semiconductors, 5G networks &amp;the;
        Internet of Things, cyber security and local SOE reform are also worth watching, as well asopportunities that
        might arise as defense stocks¡¯ share price growth catches up.</p>
