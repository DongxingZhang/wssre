    <p> Bank Indonesia surprised the market by cutting the 7-day reverse repo rate (RRP)by 25bps to 4.25%, its second
        consecutive rate cut. The cut was a response to stillsubduedlending activity and lower-than-expected inflation,
        in particular food priceinflation (which fell to 1.5% y-o-y in July and August). Although its policy
        stanceremains neutral, BI left open the possibility of further easing, which it stated wouldbe contingent on
        inflation. We expect no change for the rest of 2017.</p>
