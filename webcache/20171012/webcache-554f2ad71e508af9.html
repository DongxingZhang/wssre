    <p> Our HSI target for the year is 29,200, implying around 5% upside - the HSI does not look very attractive on
        risk-reward considerations. Our target for the HSCEI is 12,400, implying around 12% upside. Our HSI target
        implies consensus PE of 13.2/12.2x FY17F/18F, respectively (5-year average: 11.8x). Our HSCEI target implies
        FY17F/18F PE of 9.4/8.6x, respectively (5-year average: 7.9x).<br/><br/>
        Better take some profit in some sectors. We are seeing some signs that the market is losing steam, and some
        risks are growing: 1) China economy - M2 growth at historical low, other indicators are also at their recent
        lows. 2) Unclear US interest rate outlook - bond yields are exceptionally low. Is that a bubble or investors are
        worried about the growth outlook? 3) The ample liquidity in HK may end, and this could trigger a huge chain
        reaction. 4) Investors are too complacent - market volatility seems to be too low, and market participants are
        not paying enough attention to potential risks. Investors should take profit in auto makers and China consumer
        sectors like Geely (175.HK) and Tingyi (322.HK).<br/><br/>
        In general, we like the laggards. Some sectors we like include China banks (underperformed, margins and bad
        loans improving), oils (operating results improved, largely underowned), IT and software (re-rating still
        possible), China materials (commodities prices going up), and railway &amp; construction (OBOR and strong CNY).
        We also like Swire Properties (1972.HK), Wharf (4.HK) and Lee and Man Paper (2314.HK).</p>
