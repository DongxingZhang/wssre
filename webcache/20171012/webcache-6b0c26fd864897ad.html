    <p> SmarTone fights on postpaid<br/><br/>
        SmarTone has launched an unlimited offer for $298/month, aimed at reducingdownshifting into 5GB for HK$96plans -
        which have become widely promoted.Telcos in SG and TW have performed poorly during unlimited plan
        periods,however, we see this plan as helpful in preventing mobile revenuedeterioration. We believe that much of
        the pain may instead be felt in wireline,as some single people and couples look to use their phone as a modem.
        Mostlikely this does not impact mobile much, as other unlimited plans at lowerprices have long
        existed.<br/><br/>
        Cannibalizing broadband<br/><br/>
        Chunghwa Telecom has seen broadband revenue drop 6% this decade, ascable competition and unlimited mobile plans
        combined to hurt it. We expectHK users will also consider cutting their broadband cord ¨C but note that
        thepricing by address and more competitive market means broadbandaffordability is a more niche issue in HK.
        Average broadband pricing is almost2x more affordable on a GDP adjusted basis. HKT is likely to see some
        highspend users turn off, but we suspect HKBN is likely most impacted by this, asits users are more price
        sensitive. While there might be some medium-termpain, we think this development may be healthy for the sector,
        possiblyencouraging HKBN to reach something of a truce with the mobile operators,after surprising even its
        wholesale providers SmarTone and CMHK, with thedegree of industry mobile revenue pressure generated. We believe
        itswholesale deal is one year into a three year agreement. An early redo of itsterms would be welcomed.</p>
