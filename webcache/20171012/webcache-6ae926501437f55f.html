        Environmental: More regular environmental inspections to bring opportunities for industrialwater
        treatment<br/><br/>
        China recorded industrial wastewater discharge of 19.95bn tonnes in 2015with papermaking,chemical, coal mining
        &amp; washing, and textiles the most polluting industries accounting for a combined45.5% of total discharge.
        There has been a lack of regulation for industrial wastewater discharges inChina with companies (especially
        SMEs) illicitly letting out wastewater a sever issue, somethingwhich is reflected by a relatively low on-record
        discharge to water usage ratio. However, toughenedenvironmental regulation targeting the industrial sector will
        kick start widespread pollution treatment.</p>
