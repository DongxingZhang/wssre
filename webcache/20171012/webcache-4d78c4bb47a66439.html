    <p> Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) flows1: FIIs continued to sell Asian equitiesfor the third consecutive
        month, as net equity outflows touched USD9bn sinceJuly 2017. A combination of a hawkish tone from the US Federal
        Reserve andincreased geo-political tension surrounding North Korea kept investors on their toes,as they looked
        for ¡®safer havens¡¯ outside emerging Asia.<br/><br/>
        The net outflows so far in September (up to 25 September 2017) were USD3.6bn.<br/><br/>
        Thailand (USD280m) and the Philippines (USD55m) were the only markets withpositive flows in September. Taiwan
        (USD1.6bn) and India (USD920m) led theoutflows from the region.<br/><br/>
        The recent bout of outflows has resulted in a sharp decline in YTD inflows in Asianequities to USD18.4bn, down
        c50% on y-o-y. However, we believe EM Asia iscontinuing to offer attractive valuations, and better growth
        prospects compared to thedeveloped world could still give the stock market a modest rally for the rest of the
        year.</p>
