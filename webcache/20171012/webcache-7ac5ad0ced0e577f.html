    <p> April-June (1Q FY18) GDP growth came in at a three-year low. Manufacturing, at afive-year low, stood out most.
        Today's weak data can be attributed to somespecific factors such as GST related destocking, auto-correction in
        growth printsas prices stabilize, rupee appreciation, weaker agriculture and higher subsidypayout. While some of
        these could reverse over the next few quarters, others maynot. Growth has been moderating since the middle of
        2016 and we see downsiderisks to our below consensus growth forecast of 7.1% for FY18.</p>
