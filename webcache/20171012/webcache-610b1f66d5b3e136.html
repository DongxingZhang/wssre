    <p> With the September Fed meeting behind us, market attention will turn toUS tax reform prospects. Since January,
        the market has steadily loweredexpectations for such reform. Despite a tough legislative process and thelooming
        2018midterms, there are potential avenues for targeted reformsthat could be a positive for longer term GDP
        growth, if designed properly.There are two avenues for tax reform. Regular process in Congressrequires 60Senate
        votes to avoid filibuster. The Republican leadershipis currently pursuing the reconciliation process, which only
        requires amajority, allowing legislation to be passed without the minority party.For the most part in
        reconciliation, legislation must be scored as deficitneutral, although there are ways to exempt legislation from
        deficit neutralrequirements.<br/><br/>
        There are some constraints that limit the scale of tax reform. First,Congress has a busy calendar, including
        repeal / replace of the AffordableCare Act and government funding that expires December 8th. Second,the grim
        long-term fiscal outlook could act as a binding constraint, asRepublican deficit hawks may be reluctant to sign
        up for tax ¡°reform¡±that adds to the deficit. Third, finding additional revenues or offsettingspending cuts to
        limit the impact on the deficit will prove difficult. Inthis respect, as market participants parse the upcoming
        headlines out ofCongress, particular focus should be on how measures are paid for.<br/><br/>
        While there is still uncertainty, we conclude that the lowest hanging fruitfor tax reform may lie at the
        corporate level. Along with corporate tax ratecuts, one example of achievable corporate tax relief could be a
        permanentextension of business bonus depreciation, previously extended four timessince its enaction in 2008. The
        Trump administration and CongressionalRepublicans may also seek a modest household tax cut ahead of the
        midterms.Trump¡¯s recent overtures towards Democrats may help passage inthis area if cuts are skewed toward the
        middle class.<br/><br/>
        Even if a modest tax cut passes, there are forces that will likely limit thegrowth impulse. Reduction of tax
        expenditures, offsetting spending cuts,and tighter monetary policy would all work to limit the tax cuts'
        positiveimpact on growth, though it is uncertain how pre-emptive next year¡¯sFed will be after it is overhauled
        with Trump appointees. The current Fedwould want to tighten policy to prevent an overheating economy, a
        morelikely prospect if Janet Yellen is reappointed.</p>
