    <p> Stewardship code to gain ground: At our research forum for institutional investorson Sep 14, Korea Corporate
        Governance Service president MH Cho gave a presentation onthe likely effects of the introduction of Korea¡¯s
        stewardship code, which major pensionfunds and other institutional investors are likely to adopt next year. The
        government hasno intention of making the stewardship code legally binding; any legislation would stop atfleshing
        out the ¡®fiduciary duties¡¯ specified in the Financial Investment Services andCapital Markets Act.<br/><br/>
        Key issues and interpretation: MH Cho¡¯s presentation shone a light on three keyissues. First, participating
        institutional investors should adhere to the seven principles ofthe code. If, for some exceptional reason, they
        introduce a handful of the principlesselectively, or choose to apply the principles only in some cases, then
        they should explainwhy¡ªthis is known as the ¡®comply or explain¡¯ rule. Second, investors¡¯ engagement
        withcompanies should not constitute undue interference in day-to-day operations but ratherconstructive attempts
        at problem-solving. Third, institutional investors should adoptinternal guidelines that help them avoid making
        proposals (eg, regarding dividends) thatwould breach regulations banning the use of undisclosed material
        information.</p>
