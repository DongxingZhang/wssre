    <p> Another project start helps underpin mid-term outlook<br/><br/>
        BP has announced the start-up of its major 1.0bcf/d (175kboe/d) Khazzan tightgas project (60% BP) somewhat
        earlier than we had initially projected and at astated lower cost. The project start adds to the five already
        commenced so farthis year and goes a long way to underpinning BP's objective of addingc800kboe/d of new
        production by 2020. Long duration, we estimate that theKhazzan gas project should add over c$1bn to BP's annual
        operating cashflows for multiple years. Taken together with BP's other major start-ups it addsmaterial
        visibility on forward growth and cash flow, better balance to theoverall portfolio and increases forward capex
        flexibility. Buy.<br/><br/>
        Capital intensity is falling<br/><br/>
        In our recent note ¡®Sustainable? Barrels, capex, returns and cash flow to 2025¡¯available here we highlighted
        that by virtue of projects under developmentBP¡¯s production profile out to 2025added greater visibility than its
        Europeanpeers and would see BP undergo the most marked reduction in capitalintensity of the group over the next
        several years. Moreover, looking at thesuite of in development projects we estimated that BP was also
        recyclingcapital at a higher rate of return that its European peers.<br/><br/>
        Khazzan adds to cash flow stability<br/><br/>
        Following hard on the heels of other start-ups over the past several months(West Nile Delta, QAD204, Juniper,
        Persephone, etc) the announcement thatBP has started production from the Oman Khazzan tight gas project
        modestlyahead of our confidence in BP¡¯s emerging production and cash flow profile. Along duration project
        offering BP c$1bn of operating cash flow once up in fulland an IRR of c20% plus, the project not only offers BP
        material and largely oilprice independent cash flow but also helps shift BP¡¯s production profile to onethat is
        far more durable, less deepwater dependent and affords managementgreater visibility and confidence over forward
        cash flows.<br/><br/>
        Valuation &amp; Risk<br/><br/>
        Central to our investment thesis on BP is our view that as visibility on forward,project driven cash flow growth
        is better than peer. Taken together with ourexpectation that Macondo costs are set to fall materially as we move
        into 2018we believe investors will gain greater conviction that BP can sustainablysupport its dividend and grow
        cash returns to shareholders. Our price targetargues that BP should move towards a 6% nominal yield at a $1.30/¡ê
        exchangerate and is supported by our DCF model which assuming an 8% WACC, F&amp;Dcosts; of $17.5/boe and 0%
        terminal growth implies fair value at 520p.</p>
