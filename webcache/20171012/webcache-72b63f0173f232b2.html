    <p> Maintaining Hold at a target price of USD37.09<br/><br/>
        We expect YUMC to report an 18% rise in NP to RMB225m on the back of a5% rise in sales to USD1.98bn. We expect
        KFC¡¯s SSS to accelerate vs. 2Q dueto the continuous marketing campaign in an improved macro environment(China
        catering sales increased by 11.9/11.1% for Jun/Jul) and a low base in3Q16. On the cost side, we expect GPM to be
        maintained yoy and savings tocome from operational and other costs, given better store productivity. Wefine-tune
        our forecasts and maintain our Hold rating as it is fairly valued.For 3Q17(Jun-Aug), we expect 18% rise in NP to
        RMB225mThis is on a 5% rise in sales to USD1.98bn. We expect SSSg of 5% for KFC, upfrom 4% in 2Q, as 3Q16had a
        low base (affected by the Sino-US tension onthe South Sea dispute in Jul 16). On PH, we expect a 2% decline in
        SSS, due tohigher base and the continuing revamping of the operation.<br/><br/>
        Revising NP forecast for FY17/18/19<br/><br/>
        We revise our FY17/18/19estimates by -5%/-0.3%/+0.2% to reflect the latestRMB trend, revisit our EBITM
        assumption, and update our model based on itslatest segment breakdown. As a result, our revised target price is
        USD37.09.<br/><br/>
        Raising our target price by 1% to USD37.09; risks<br/><br/>
        Our primary valuation methodology is DCF, employing COE of 9.2%, a beta of0.95and a TGR of 2%. This produces
        USD37.09/share, implying a 2017/18P/Eof 26x/23x. Upside risks: better-than-expected operating margins and
        SSSg;<br/><br/>
        lower-than-expected intensity in competition; and lower-than-expected laborcost increases. Downside risks:
        intense competition; changes in consumerpreferences; failure to pass on cost hikes to customers; and failure to
        optimizestore portfolio (see p.3).</p>
