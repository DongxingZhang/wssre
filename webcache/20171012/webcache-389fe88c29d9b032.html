    <p> Weak sentiment for metals/commodities<br/><br/>
        The commodity complex has been generally weak for last few days. Several neartermevents might triggered the
        weakness.<br/><br/>
        (1) Chinese macro data in August createdsome reads about slowdown of China economy resulting from supply-side
        reform(SSR) and environmental control;(2) China government starts to halt/freezeinfrastructure projects in major
        northern cities as Beijing and Tianjin;(3) near-termUSD appreciation also assisted to correct certain commodity
        prices. We believethese have triggered investors to take profits from commodity futures andcommodity equities.
        We think the market will take some time to factor these newdevelopments but our fundamental bullish view remains
        intact.<br/><br/>
        There are phases and magnitudes for "freezing"According to what have been announced, construction projects
        (representingdownstream demand) in Beijing and Tianjin have halted. From Oct 1st, cokingfacilities need to slow
        down about 30% for Northern China 26+2cities. Steel millswill need to halt 50% production starting from Nov 15.
        As government freezesdownstream demand unexpectedly ahead of midstream producers, spot/futuremarkets are
        factoring this short term weakness. Nevertheless, based on our checkswith various producers/traders, general
        belief is SD balance will still be steel = coke&gt; coking coal &gt; iron ore due to various magnitudes of
        shutdown by sub-sectors.<br/><br/>
        Strict environmental measures implies structural change<br/><br/>
        Recent developments crystallize China government's determination to fight againstpollution in winter. Beijing
        City government has an aggressive target of reducingPM2.5by 20-25% measured by overall average and polluting
        days. We believe thisshould be also associated with 2022Winter Olympics to be held in HebeiZhangjiakou, only
        200km from Beijing. China only has five winters to experiment andfix the winter air pollution in Northern China.
        Similar pollutants might need decadesto fix in precedent examples in other developed countries. We believe this
        shouldimply China government's endeavors for SSR are structural and can sustain longerthan the market
        expected.<br/><br/>
        Hot spring after freezing winter<br/><br/>
        We found interesting dynamics can evolve after the infrastructure project halts inwinter. A possible scenario is
        that infrastructural projects will resume in spring 2018,by which time Meanwhile, inventory level for steel and
        industrial products mightremain low. As such, restocking activities will potentially be strong again by then.The
        Chinese government's temporary initiatives in winter might help to lengthen thecycle for steel and other metals.
        With the structural changes driven by priority ofenvironmental policies at the supply side and potential pushed
        further demand cycle,our bullish views for most of the sub-sectors as steel, aluminum, cement
        remainsintact.<br/><br/>
        Another round of mismatches; Buy on dips<br/><br/>
        We believe recent corrections offer another window for investors to build uppositions in several commodity
        sub-sectors. In our view, several mismatches will stillcorrect in the end. For example, some investors trade
        steel stocks using iron oreprices as leading indicators but fail to observe resilience of steel mills
        profitability,while some trade coal sector based on the government's announcement aboutincrease supply but
        failed to see limited capex being invested to counter to high coalprices. Inventory levels are reasonably
        healthy for both examples. We therefore reiterateour bullish views and our top picks remain Maanshan, JFE, and
        ChinaShenhua. We value these cyclical names based on PBx/ROE matrix and the threestocks have the greatest
        mismatches for their high ROE against low PBx.</p>
