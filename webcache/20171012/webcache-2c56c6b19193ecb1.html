    <p> Conference call and cancellation of syndicated loan¡£<br/><br/>
        Shandong Ruyi conducted a conference call last week wherein it mentionedcancellation of a EUR600million
        syndicated loan. This loan was partlyexpected to be used for buying out co-investors¡¯ stake in the SPV
        holding81.9% stake in SMCP. We understand that this buyout was not mandatory asthe company has no obligation to
        buy the stake from co-investors till 2019(ifcertain financial targets are not met for 2017and 2018). Separately,
        if SMCP¡¯sIPO doesn¡¯t take place within 5years of acquisition (in 2016), Ruyi is alsorequired to buyout
        co-investors. That said, we do think co-investors may stilllook to sell their stake in SPV prior to potential
        overseas IPO of SMCP.¡£<br/><br/>
        The company also provided more details on the holding structure of the SPV(which in turn holds an 81.9% stake in
        SMCP). Ruyi holds a 51.8% stake(contributed RMB2.9billion) in the SPV, while Yinchuan SASAC andZhonghang hold
        24.1% each (contributed RMB1.35billion each). Based on theconference call, we understand that Zhonghang is AVIC
        Trust.¡£<br/><br/>
        Separately, the company also mentioned that recent discussion with YinchuanSASAC indicated that the Yinchuan
        Government might designate YinchuanFinance Holding, rather than Yinchuan Yinxin, as the successor of
        YinchuanTonglian¡¯s 26% stake in Ruyi.¡£</p>
