    <p> Slower banking assets &amp; credit growth, less shadow, but better transparency¡£<br/><br/>
        Last Friday the regulators released loan &amp; TSF data and balance sheet detailsof all banks in China. We note
        the financial deleveraging campaign hascontinued to make progresses: banking assets growth softened further;
        loanand TSF beat estimates but the overall credit growth actually moderated;<br/><br/>
        shadow banking size was shrinking while loan growth stayed resilient. As suchfrom the financial system¡¯s
        perspective we see improving transparency andlower liquidity risks. While the deleveraging has contributed to a
        modestlyslower economy, the growth momentum is in line with our house view. We donot foresee policies to ease
        and we expect the deleveraging to carry on orderly.¡£<br/><br/>
        Softened banking asset growth, driven by smaller banks and shadow banking¡£<br/><br/>
        Asset growth in the China banking system has slid to a 10-year low at 10.3%yoy as of August 2017(2016: 15.7%),
        as banks cut excessive leverage. Lenderwise, the slower asset growth was dragged down mainly by smaller
        banks.Total asset growth of joint-stock and city/rural banks (45% of total bankingassets) decelerated notably to
        12% yoy in July from 19% in 2016(Figure 3).Particularly, JSBs¡¯ asset growth declined to 7.5% from 17.2% in
        2016.Business wise, interbank assets and interbank liabilities fell 14% yoy and 2%yoy respectively, according to
        CBRC. Banks¡¯ WMP balance continued to slow,driven mainly by reduced interbank WMP by Rmb2.2tr YTD.¡£<br/><br/>
        Credit volume beat estimates, but credit growth actually moderated¡£<br/><br/>
        August new loans and TSF recorded Rmb1.09tr and Rmb1.48tr, respectively,both exceeding consensus estimates.
        However, if the municipal bond issuanceof Rmb470bn (July: Rmb845bn) were added, the adjusted system creditgrowth
        would have moderated to 15.0% yoy vs. 15.4% in July (Figure 6).Notably following a series of tightening
        regulations banks are bringing off-BSshadow banking into on-BS, leading to strong loan growth (13.2% yoy)
        butslower shadow banking growth. Total bank loans represented 78% of TSF inAugust vs. 67% in the past three
        years. Shadow banking finance wererelatively muted, while trust loans were the only exception with strong
        growth.¡£<br/><br/>
        Household leveraging up¡£<br/><br/>
        A breakdown by borrower suggests household and corporate sectorscontinued to lever up, which made up 35%/38% of
        new system credit inAugust vs. 25%/23% in July. Note that while mortgage growth had slowed,short-term retail
        loan growth further accelerated to 15.8% yoy in August (vs.15.3% in July or 7.3% in 1Q17). We attribute this to
        the strong growth in creditcard receivables (up 31% yoy as of Jun 2017; see our report: ¡°China¡¯s creditcard
        boom?¡±) and consumption loans (43% yoy). What still puzzles us is theuse of funds. We cannot exclude the
        possibility of some consumption loansbeing used to finance purchases of property, as reported by media. But
        giventhe PBOC¡¯s credit data system in place and banks¡¯ post-loan management weinitially believed the portion of
        property-related lending might be insignificant.¡£<br/><br/>
        Policy outlook: easing unlikely, so elevated market rates to benefit the Big4¡£<br/><br/>
        We believe China will continue to push for financial deleveraging as the goalhas not been achieved and economic
        conditions stayed resilient. With elevatedmarket rates the big banks should benefit. We continue to prefer big
        banksand stay cautions on smaller ones. Top picks: ICBC and BOC.¡£</p>
