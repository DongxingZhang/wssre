    <p> Search for next growth driver is ongoing: We attended the 2017 SEMICONTaiwan hosted by global industry
        association SEMI last week. Speakers at theMarket Trends forum mainly focused on the near-term prospects of the
        global techindustry and their expectations for the next growth driver. In the near term, speakersexpected the
        focus to remain on smartphones, while investment focuses on theespecially strong memory demand and ongoing
        expansion of auto electronics anddata centre. Looking into the longer term, speakered highlighted growth in AI,
        highperformance computing (HPC), and robotics as the major drivers of semi content.<br/><br/>
        Power and compound semis: Given consolidation within pure Silicon is quite clear,we were more attracted by Power
        and Compound Semi¡¯s given this segment¡¯spositive outlook, given potential demand from
        5G/VCSEL/Power/Automotive/IoT,despite the still-evolving industry dynamics. During the forum, speakers focused
        onthe current developments of GaAs, GaN, and Silicon-based compounds and uses invarious applications. While
        there were some debates as to whether Silicon-basedcompounds could be a good substitute for III-V compounds in
        specific applications,consensus remains positive given a growing need for high power density andoperation
        efficiency systems. Speakers also highlighted key trends they expect tosee as we head closer to 5G, including:
        (1) pre-standard in 2018, commercial launchin 2019/2020, and mass adoption by 2025; (2) adoption of MIMO
        (Multi-in/Multi-out)to boost capacity/switching and temperature capabilities, reduce interference, andfacilitate
        more machine communication among IoT devices; and (3) deployment ofbase stations/small cells in enabling
        millimetre radio waves.<br/><br/>
