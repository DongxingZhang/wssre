    <p> Apple unveils upgrades¡­: Apple CEO Tim Cook yesterday unveiled upgradedversions of several flagship products,
        which is part of the US giant¡¯s efforts to stemslowing sales by enhancing or utilizing established technologies
        (vs showcasing new ones).<br/><br/>
        The latest Apple Watch will feature phone functionality (like the Galaxy Watch), while thenew: 1) Apple TV will
        support 4K and HDR video; and 2) iPhone 8 and 8 Plus will includewireless charging and upgraded cameras. We
        expect the latest versions to attractreplacement demand from customers already using the firm¡¯s
        products.<br/><br/>
        ¡­and iPhone X: Cook unveiled the iPhone X (ten) during a traditional ¡°One MoreThing¡± announcement, which some
        believe can revive growth momentum after previousversions of the Apple Watch and TV (as well as HomePod) all
        faltered. The iPhone X lacksnew killer apps, but its technological advancements warrant attention and are likely
        toattract replacement demand, with shipments set to commence on Nov 3. Even though thelate date is unfortunate,
        it will still be in time for Christmas gift-giving season.<br/><br/>
        ¡¤ 3D sensors: The X version will utilize facial recognition to authenticate and unlockthe phone and facial
        mapping to recognize and confirm IDs. This should allow 3Dmapping via the device¡¯s rear-facing camera, which can
        also be utilized for Animoji, thecompany¡¯s term for animated emojis used in the iMessage feature.<br/><br/>
        ¡¤ Flexible displays: The X only has a flexible display on its front, but such technologycould eventually alter
        the way information is relayed on such devices. Notably, SECplans to debut a foldable smartphone next year,
        which might be a precursor to onefeaturing the technology in sizes twixt an iPad and Note.<br/><br/>
        ¡¤ Machine leaning: The iPhone X will feature several independent processors,including an A11 bionic AP, GPU,
        ISP, and neural engine, with the latter to beembedded in the former to optimize machine-learning algorithms. The
        neural enginewill also function with the GPU to perform on-device learning and computations.</p>
