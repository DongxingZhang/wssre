    <p> The global gas glut is creating more opportunities forconsumers to lower costs, as implied by PLNG's reported
        pricerenegotiations with Exxon. We see upside risk from lower gascosts and higher volume growth for top gas glut
        plays ¨C PTTand PLNG ¨C as well as benefits for refiners and CNG players.<br/><br/>
        Price renegotiation to lower PLNG's gas import (LNG) prices by 10-12%: Mediareports (e.g., Financial Express)
        today have suggested that PLNG has renegotiatedthe pricing of LNG for its 1.4Mtpa contract with Exxon to import
        LNG from itsGorgon project signed in 2009. If correct, this would be the second successfulrenegotiation carried
        out by an Indian gas company, after a successfulrenegotiation with Qatar in late 2015. The media reports also
        suggested thatunder the revised terms, Exxon has agreed to charge 13.9% of the oil price on adelivered-to-India
        basis versus the earlier price of 14.5% on an FOB (free onboard) basis. While still high compared to recent
        contracts signed by regionalplayers, this does highlight the rising upside risk for Indian gas players
        andconsumers.<br/><br/>
        Limited impact on earnings in near term, but reduces investor concern abouthigh-cost gas: PLNG remains a
        defensive gas play, as it doesn¡¯t take any pricerisks ¨C even Gorgon volumes were sold back-to-back to BPCL, IOCL
        and GAIL.<br/><br/>
        However, investors have been concerned about the scenario of a possibledefault on this contract by its
        offtakers, due to higher prices, which, in our view, isnow well addressed. The impact on GAIL, BPCL and IOCL's
        earnings would be inthe order of 1-2%, by our estimates, considering it remains a small part of theiroverall gas
        portfolio.<br/><br/>
        The downward price revision in long-term LNG contracts also highlights upsiderisks for PTT's earnings as it
        signs new contracts for importing gas. We estimatethat the company will double its LNG sourcing contracts by
        2019, after havingincreased them by ~3x in the past year. While PTT¡¯s gas sourcing contracts havebeen not as
        expensive as those signed by Indian firms, upside risk exists from gasprices converging towards the current oil
        linkage at 10-11%. A 10% reduction inLNG prices impacts earnings by 4-5% as gas to oil spreads widen (for
        details seehere.)Global oversupply of LNG to persist until 2022-23: Our analysis of globalsupplies (for detail
        see here) suggests that the LNG market is likely to remainoversupplied until 2022-23, as we expect ~135mt of LNG
        supplies to come onlinebetween 2016-20e, which is ~50% of existing LNG capacity. This supply additioncompares
        with just ~5 Mt of supply that was added between 2011 and 2015.<br/><br/>
        Most of the new supply will come from the US and Australia.</p>
