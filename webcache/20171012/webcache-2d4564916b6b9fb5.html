    <p> Industry recovery and market share gains through high-end products.We expect the liquid milk industry to grow by
        6% in 3Q17(vs. 7% in 1H17)and Yili's market share in liquid milk to increase from 33.6% in June to34% in
        September. High-end products, including UHT yoghurt, high-endyoghurt and pro biotic drinks, are the key sales
        drivers. Meanwhile, weexpect the lower tier region and special channel to deliver higher salesgrowth helped by
        Yili's increasing penetrations.<br/><br/>
        Our recent channel check indicates that its sales growth remainsstrong in 3Q. The Shanghai distributor indicated
        that its room temperateproducts grew at 8% in both 1H17and 3Q; the Shenzhen distributorindicated its sales grew
        at higher than 10% YTD. Meanwhile, we find thatMengniu and Yili are revising up ex-factory price and retail
        price from July,implying that industry competition continues to ease down.<br/><br/>
        90bps yoy expansion of recurring EBIT margin. Our recent channelcheck indicates the price competition is
        stabilizing. We believe themore balanced supply/demand in upstream should also lead to a stablecompetition
        environment. Accordingly, we forecast a yoy flattish sellingexpense/sales ratio in 3Q17. The yoy EBIT margin
        expansion is mainlyhelped by lower G&amp;A;/sales from a high base in 3Q16, while partly offsetby lower gross
        margin on rising packaging cost and milk powder price.<br/><br/>
        Sales growth to accelerate in 2017-19<br/><br/>
        Liquid milk growth is recovering from low single digits in 2016to high single digitsin 2017. Firstly, we think
        this is mainly helped by more balanced supply from2017, and we expect raw milk cycle to turn from over-supply in
        2014-16to undersupplyin 2018-19. Secondly, the recovery is also helped by trading up demandfrom low-end milk
        beverage to pure milk and yoghurt. Thirdly, this is helped byYili's increasing penetration in lower tier regions
        and special channels. We believethese drivers are sustainable. We forecast Yili's sales CAGR to improve from
        8%in 2014-16to 11% in 2017-18E.</p>
