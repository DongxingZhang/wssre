    <p> Summary<br/><br/>
        The meeting statement and press conference message came across as expected.Reinvestment tapering will begin in
        October, and barring negative surprises, theCommittee is on track to raise rates one more time this year and
        still expects threehikes in 2018. Chair Yellen emphasized that the balance sheet tapering processthat has been
        set into motion will not be stopped or reversed unless the economytakes a significant hit and the fed funds
        target has had to be reduced back close tozero. There were a few interesting changes in the FOMC¡¯s economic
        projections,and we came away from the press conference feeling that Yellen would accepta second term as chair if
        offered.</p>
