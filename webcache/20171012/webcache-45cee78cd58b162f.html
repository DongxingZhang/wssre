    <p> Bank Indonesia is likely to keep its policy unchanged when it meets on September22. While there are some
        expectations of further easing following the surprise ratecut on 22 August, we believe it was likely a one-off
        for now (see: Time to cut: Anopportunity for Bank Indonesia, 7 August) and was a response to weak growth in
        thefirst half of the year coupled with decelerating inflation (particularly around Eid: foodprices rose 1.5%
        y-o-y in July, a rate that was unchanged in the August print).<br/><br/>
        We believe growth will remain below potential this year, particularly given thedeceleration in loan growth since
        the peak in April (9.5% y-o-y, compared to the10-12% full year target). But there are signs that growth will
        improve slightly intoyear-end. Loan growth appears to have stabilized in July after falling to 7.7% in June,and
        exports accelerated sharply to 19.2% y-o-y in August (Bbg: 8.3%). Meanwhile,consumer confidence and motorcycle
        sales have remained elevated, and the recentcement consumption trend has accelerated.<br/><br/>
        But what about inflation? True, headline CPI has continued to decelerate in August, fallingto 3.8% y-o-y from
        3.9% in July. But we think the prints in the coming months will riseslightly and hover around the mid-point,
        before falling more meaningfully in January 2018when high base effects kick in (thanks to electricity subsidy
        adjustments in early-2018).<br/><br/>
        However, this also coincides with the 50bp downshift in BI's inflation target to 2.5-4.5% in2018, which also
        means that the central bank will need to tread cautiously.<br/><br/>
        All the while, the Fed will be embarking on an unprecedented divestment program, themarket impact of which is
        hard to fully ascertain. As such, BI will likely opt for the cautiousroute, and preserve its ammo. That said, we
        believe that the outturn of Fed and ECBpolicy will ultimately prove more dovish than markets are currently
        expecting. As such,foreign appetite for Indonesian assets should remain robust into next year, which canprovide
        a protective environment for further easing. Indeed, with growth likely to remainbelow-potential next year, even
        if partly driven by structural concerns, we expect anadditional rate cut in 2Q18, bringing the policy rate to
        4.25% by end-2018.</p>
