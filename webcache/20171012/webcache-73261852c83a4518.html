    <p> PBOC &amp; Beijing CBRC: Prohibiting Consumer Lending Fund from Flowing to Property Market (Sina, Sept
        6)¡£<br/><br/>
        Beijing CBRC and PBOC on Tuesday issued notice to check illegal fund use of consumer loans for house purchase,
        requiring local banking institutions to self-check retail consumption and operational lending business, local
        media reported. The self-checking focus will be illegal fund use of consumer loans backed by existing property,
        which flowed to property market seen in some cases. Post the self-checking, the regulators will conduct special
        inspection and punish those institutions which still have the issues.¡£<br/><br/>
        (DB view) We saw strong growth in China¡¯s short-term consumption loans in the past 3-4 months, with balance up
        34-35% yoy to make up close to 9-10% of all net new credit provision in China. From bottom-up perspective, we
        note joint-stock banks grew credit card business very strongly in 1H17, with credit card receivable accelerating
        to 43% yoy and fees up 51% yoy. However, we are not entirely sure that the banks maintained strict underwriting
        standards and monitored the uses of funds properly. In the past months, CBRC has imposed fines on some banks
        regarding lending to unqualified borrowers and lack of proper post-lending monitor. We think those banks with
        loosened underwriting standard may face tighter regulatory pressure going forward. Please refer to our report:

        Risks Arose Frequently in Consumer Finance Companies (Sina, Sept 6)¡£<br/><br/>
        Year-to-date, consumer finance companies have accumulatively received three tickets from regulator with total
        fine close to Rmb10mn. The first ticket was issued to Mashang Consumer Finance in Chongqing City for the
        violation of credit check regulation. Bank of Chongqing is the company¡¯s 4th biggest shareholder. The second one
        was issued to Hubei Consumer Finance for conducting unapproved business; Hubei Bank owns 50% of the company¡¯s
        share stakes. Bank of Beijing Consumer Finance Co. was the third one to be punished for several violations; the
        fine reached Rmb9mn, above 10 times higher than total fines to the first two companies. BOBJCFC has reported a
        net loss of c.Rmb1.35bn in 2016. On the flip sides, some consumer finance companies still operated well so far,
        ie, BOC Consumer Finance and CMB Consumer Finance have reported net profit of Rmb640mn/Rmb541mn respectively in
        1H17, both up above 100% yoy.¡£</p>
