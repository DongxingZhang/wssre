    <p> Green Certificates, subsidies, carbon trading. Given aggressive solar installationthis year (2016: +34GW; 8M17:
        38GW; 2017e: 50GW), the current RMB60bn deficitat the Renewable Energy Fund will likely widen, putting at risk
        the predictability of thesettlement cycle of subsidies to renewable energy operators. The Green
        Certificateprogramme (GC) is the proposed solution, as it creates incentive alternatives to thefixed subsidies.
        We understand the government is preparing an elaborate GC policy,but the final launch (mandatory application) is
        likely to be delayed from the originalstart date (Jan 2018) given some political obstacles. Both the National
        Development&amp; Reform Commission (NDRC) and State Grid (unlisted) believe it will be a challengefor nationwide
        GC trading to gain popularity. The China Emission Exchange inShenzhen, on the other hand, is confident about a
        national launch of a carbon tradingscheme in 2018, which could eventually replace GC, as the two schemes
        servesimilar purposes. Although the policy outlook remains unclear, we are optimistic onrenewable energy (e.g.
        wind operators) given current valuations and year-to-dateunderperformance. On this trip, we learned that GC is
        likely to be applicable only tonew installations while existing capacity should enjoy the grandfather law ¨C
        implyinglimited downside to average tariffs. Other than IPPs, electricity retailers may berequired to purchase
        GCs. Also, the government may consider hiking the renewableenergy surcharge for electricity users by 58%, to
        RMB0.03/kWh, which does notconflict with GC trading and could provide temporary relief for the subsidy
        problemthat operators now face (with delayed settlements). Buy-rated Huaneng Renewables(958 HK, CP: HKD2.58, TP:
        HKD3.30) is our preferred wind farm operator.<br/><br/>
        Gas distribution/transmission. As the 19th Party Congress approaches (opening on18 October), we expect the
        government to continue to support the use of gas over coal,with increased local support (e.g. subsidies to
        users). Since the recent transmissiontariff cut, Beijing Gas (owned by Beijing Enterprises Holdings, ¡°BEH¡±, 392
        HK, Buy,CP: HKD42.00, TP: HKD48.00) believes its Shaanxi-Beijing pipeline will alreadyoperate at an 8% ROA per
        the latest regulations, with the risk overhang removed.<br/><br/>
        BEH is acquiring a 29% interest in the LNG terminal at Tangshan at an undemanding1.0x 2016 PB, which stands to
        benefit from China¡¯s accelerating growth in gas imports(LNG imports y-t-d: up 38% y-o-y) and add stability to
        gas supply in the region.<br/><br/>
        Data centres ¨C Driving force of power demand. We visited the data centres ownedby HSBC (Hong Kong) and Global
        Data Solution (Shenzhen) running on some of thelatest energy-efficient technologies. We note that
        telecommunications has the fastestgrowth in electricity demand (8M18e: +14.8%) versus the national (+6.8%).</p>
