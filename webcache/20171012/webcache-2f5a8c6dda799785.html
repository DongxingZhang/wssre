    <p> Our Oil and Gas Plenary Session Conference Highlights<br/><br/>
        On 14th September at DB's Annual Oil &amp; Gas Conference industry consultantWood Mackenzie presented its latest
        thoughts on the prospects for oil supply,US tight oil, refining and global gas &amp; LNG. Reflecting its
        detailed analysis ofthe shifts in the supply/demand balance across the different end markets, WMremains cautious
        on the near-term outlook for oil markets although it does seegrowing risk to the consensus for US supply growth.
        However, the mid-termpicture for oil is tightening and the outlook has also improved for Europeangas, LNG and
        refining. Summarized below this note includes key slides fromthe presentations and the main messages contained
        within.<br/><br/>
        Shifting back into surplus in H2-18but $70-80/bbl needed longer term<br/><br/>
        Strong supply growth is expected to return in 2018almost entirely on the backof US tight oil, with growth of
        +1.2mb/d nearly enough to satisfy world oildemand growth of +1.3mb/d. Field-level analysis suggests non-OPEC
        declinerates will not go much beyond 5% through 2020on improved efficiencies,targeted spending, and greater
        production from early-life assets. Longer term,Wood Mac (WM) continues to believe that a mid-cycle oil price of
        $70-80/bblwill be required to incentivize sufficient non-OPEC investment beyond the USonshore in order to offset
        a potential 17mb/d supply gap by 2025.<br/><br/>
        US Tight Oil: Strong near-term, but flagging some LT areas of downside risk<br/><br/>
        US tight oil continues to dominate non-OPEC growth, with the Permianresource base remaining especially
        advantaged. However, WM also outlineseveral areas of concern vs investor expectations. Near-term growth rates
        arenot as strong as implied by weekly EIA data, with more accurate monthly 914data showing a more modest
        run-rate. Analysis also points to mid-term risks tothe rate of growth, where reservoir downside (parent-child
        wells, GOR) holdspotential to offset incremental technology gains. The production trend towardsa lighter barrel
        (API &gt;45) is also unhelpful for realized liquid prices.<br/><br/>
        Refining: Extended robust demand has tightened to global system<br/><br/>
        Stronger than expected demand growth at a time of modest capacityexpansion has improved the near term outlook
        for refining margins. Withchanges in marine bunker fuel requirements also coming into view (2020) theoutlook for
        European and global refining margins through end decade is seenas much more supportive. Move beyond 2020,
        however, and demand growthis expected to start to moderate most notably in Europe and the US despitewhich Asia
        continues to add refining capacity. Petchem integration grows inimportance, transport demand growth is skewed
        towards middle distillates(trucking and aviation) whilst gasoline supply moving to excess.<br/><br/>
        Gas &amp; LNG: Rebalance pulled forwards a year but 2019/20look very long<br/><br/>
        Demand from China and Asia has been notably stronger than expectedenabling markets to remain in balance, and has
        the potential to continue todrive above forecast demand - not least in Korea &amp; China. Modest start-updelays
        have also lent near term support. However, 2019/20still appearchallenged by excess supply with US shut-ins
        likely dependent upon Russia¡¯sapproach to m/s. Overall, the era of supply excess may, nevertheless,
        unwindearlier than thought with the new supply needed by 2022(was c2023).</p>
