    <p> Government unveils 10-year biotech industry support roadmap¡­: Korea¡¯sBiotechnology Policy Deliberation Council,
        which is overseen by the Ministry of Scienceand ICT, yesterday approved its third masterplan for biotech
        support. The cross-industryplan to nurture biotech is formulated once a decade and amended every 5 years under
        theBiotechnology Support Act. Expecting a rise in demand for biotech¡ªrelated to populationaging, infectious
        diseases, food safety, and climate change¡ªthe blueprint aims to nurtureKorea¡¯s science and technology for the
        biotech industry and make the nation an innovatorin the forthcoming bio-economy era. Officials see biotech as a
        high-value-added futureindustry as well as being a pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.<br/><br/>
        ¡­that aims to lift nation¡¯s global biotech market share to 5% by 2025: Thelatest plan envisions raising Korea¡¯s
        global biotech market share from 1.7% (KRW27t) in2015 to 5% (KRW152t) in 2025, by: 1) discovering 100 new drug
        candidates, adding to thetotal of 85 discovered thus far; 2) creating 120,000 industry jobs for a total of
        145,000through 1,250 venture startups, 30 local listed firms with promising technology, fourglobal players, and
        two industrial clusters employing over 30,000 each; 3) increasingglobal out-licensing deals by 500%; and 4)
        relying more on biotech R&amp;D; to solve socialproblems. Accordingly, the government has set out three
        strategies¡ªie, innovatingbiotech R&amp;D;, shifting to a bio-economy, and providing the basis for a
        nationalecosystem¡ªand nine action plans. This year alone related investments will probablyreach KRW3.1t (up 0.7%
        from 2016) for R&amp;D;, infrastructure, and to groom talent.<br/><br/>
        Details: The roadmap aims to: 1) develop unique technologies via innovative R&amp;Dactivities; in promising
        areas¡ªeg, synthetic biology, microbiome, and gene correction; 2)reinforce R&amp;D; investments in home-grown
        blockbuster drugs, green bio business, finedust reduction, and to develop safe chemical substitutes; 3) promote
        convergent R&amp;Dactivities; spanning precision medicine, brain research, and next-generation medicaldevices;
        and 4) achieve first-mover advantage in nascent markets and new convergencetechnologies. To make economic gains
        from unique technologies, the government plans tonurture human resource, new businesses, and create jobs that
        combine biotechnologieswith ICT technologies and medical and financial services. Related support will: 1) be
        givento the ICT-based medical service industry; 2) foster homegrown contract researchorganizations; 3) support
        equipment/materials suppliers; 4) pursue development oftechnologies that could reduce imports; 5) create
        intercity clusters; 6) turn hospitals intoinnovative bases; and 7) expand bio-ecosystems to compete globally.
