        Strategy.***After several weeks of summer quiet, fund investors showed increased signs ofconviction last week as
        our 'money at work' indicator rose to its highest level intwo months (see Fig. 4). While a weaker dollar
        continued to help make US assetsmore attractive overseas, investors also seemed to have cheered the
        risk-positivenewsflow out of Washington with the UN security council's unanimous decisionto impose new sanctions
        on North Korea and the rise in expectations of a longpromised US tax cut. As a result, last week's inflows were
        largely driven by therenewed interest in developed market funds, with both equity (seven-week highinflows) and
        bond funds (five-week high inflows) picking up from their summerlows. Most notably, US equity funds saw
        three-month high inflows, snapping outof their recent outflow trend which noted 11 weeks of outflows over the
        past 12.<br/><br/>
        On the other side of the Atlantic, the stronger Euro and the fade in Euro area macromomentum continued to drag
        on European equity funds. And with Euro areamacro surprises continuing to roll over relative to those in the US,
        flow momentuminto US-domiciled equity funds has now moved back to US shores and away fromEurope (see Fig. 1).
        However, the sharp drop in the market-implied probability ofthe Fed hiking this week meant that bond funds
        sustained their inflow trend, asUS sovereign bond funds witnessed highest weekly inflows since January
        2016.<br/><br/>
        The continuously weak dollar on the back of this reflected well in EM bond andequity funds, which saw inflows
        for yet another week. And EM inflows over thepast three months could have been even stronger, given the fall in
        the dollar overthe same period (see Fig. 2).</p>
