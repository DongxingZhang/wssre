    <p> Mexico: Political implications likely more relevant than economic implications<br/><br/>
        On September 19th , Mexico City, Guerrero, Edomex, and Morelos were hit bya 7.1magnitude earthquake on the
        Richter scale. Rescue operations are stillongoing but over 320deaths have been confirmed and more than
        7,500buildingswere damaged in Mexico City alone. Despite the tragic human costs of thedisaster, we think that
        the economic implications are likely to be limited: yearendgrowth is likely to fall by 0.1percentage points
        while inflation is unlikely tobe impacted significantly. Political implications might be more relevant:
        Andr¨¦sManuel L¨®pez Obrador has quickly capitalized on the widespread antigovernmentanimus by offering to donate
        half of Morena's campaign funds to the victims ofthe earthquake. Because he is perceived as an outsider, AMLO's
        candidacy islikely to strengthen in the post-earthquake environment. If the government failsto meet public
        expectations as the reconstruction process gets under way, or ifthe collapse of buildings in Mexico City can be
        attributed to failures of regulators,the AMLO's chances for 2018would become stronger. See our note on
        Mexicofordetails.</p>
