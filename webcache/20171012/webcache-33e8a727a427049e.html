    <p> In this issue we ask whether cryptocurrencies are just a passing fad and whetheranything can replace US$ as
        store of value and medium of exchange.<br/><br/>
        When a number of financial executives recently described Bitcoin as a ¡°fraud¡±akin to the tulip mania, it
        exhibited their apparent lack of appreciation offundamental shifts that are altering global monetary and
        financial systems. If onedescribes Bitcoin as a fraud, how would one describe a ¡®financial cloud¡¯ that is
        atleast 4x-5x larger than the underlying economies? It is unlikely that US$400trillion+ of financial instruments
        circulating around the world would ever be repaidand most are now backed by assets that are already either
        worthless or arediminishing in value. How does one describe rates and the yield curve that areeither directly
        determined by CBs (BoJ or PBoC) or heavily influenced by them(Fed or ECB)? People living in glass houses should
        not throw stones.<br/><br/>
        We view cryptocurrencies as a response to a world where business and capitalcycles are micromanaged by state
        agencies, with the single most important price(cost of money) determined by CBs, thus precluding price
        discovery. Statederivedprices lead to ¡®black market¡¯ economies as the only means of reflectingpressures that are
        otherwise suppressed. In extremes, it ultimately leads tobarter economies. In the 1920s, the US prohibition made
        liquor more valuablethan dollars, while in the mid-¡¯90s, Russian factories traded tanks or missiles forpotatoes,
        and a similar barter system prevails today in Congo, Cuba andVenezuela. As potatoes kept value better than
        tanks, cryptocurrencies areperceived to be outside the state-controlled system. While we do not pass ajudgement
        as to the value of Bitcoin, we view cryptocurrencies as a naturaloutgrowth of an over-financialized fiat-based
        monetary system. Fintech thatenables cryptocurrencies is currently rewiring the entire global monetary
        system.<br/><br/>
        It reduces costs but threatens to disintermediate banks (commercial &amp; CBs).<br/><br/>
        However, some argue that if cryptocurrencies impinge upon the ability of CBs tomanage liquidity, they can just
        ban them. This is true, but it ignores fundamentalreasons as to why these alternatives appeared in the first
        place, which wouldremain valid, irrespective of state actions. If Bitcoin is banned or restricted, anew
        alternative will arise. Why not seashells? Seashell Beach in WA has beenrated as the place with the most
        abundant supply of some of the best seashells;perhaps Perth could become the new global CB. What about gold?
        Although it isincompatible with ongoing financialization, gold is far from a ¡®barbarous relic¡¯ andis highly
        likely to maintain its attractiveness. What if gold is also banned? Thenother barter swaps would emerge. Indeed,
        the world of the Information Age isincreasingly one of commons, where people already exchange products
        andservices (spare bedroom for a car; book review for coupons). While it doescreate a major headache for
        economists, within a decade this sharing is likely tobecome ubiquitous and perhaps even the dominant form of
        interactions.<br/><br/>
        Just as Sheena Easton¡¯s 1981 hit song (Nine to Five) has already passed intoancient history, together with other
        antiquated concepts, such as middle class,picket fences and career path, the idea that CBs can manage billions
        of signalsis as outdated as the Soviets measuring output by weight. Even with AI-assistedplanning, human
        ingenuity and technology are likely to outsmart planners. Isthere a role for cryptocurrencies and gold in
        investment portfolios?Absolutely. These are insurance policies against degrading of fiat currencies.<br/><br/>
        However, for now, US$ remains the king and until changes to the monetarysystem become more pronounced
        (cryptocurrencies account for ~0.5% of cashin circulation), economies would continue to reside on a de-facto US$
        standard.</p>
