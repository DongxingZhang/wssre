        Trump administration releases Unified Tax Reform Framework. With a goal ofraising American salaries and bringing
        more jobs and dollars into the economy,the framework shrinks the current 7personal tax brackets into 3(12%,
        25%and 35%). Other key highlights: corporate tax to be set at 20% (vs. 35%), whilesmall and family-owned
        business would be taxed at 25%. Expensing of capexto be allowed for 5-years. However, this reform could cost the
        government upto $3tn over 10-years, so it is still unclear which parts of the proposal will make itto formal
        legislation. We believe there is a prospect for some reforms occurringat the corporate level, especially with
        small corporates, but the potential forsubstantive reform of personal tax is lower. (Reuters, DB)</p>
