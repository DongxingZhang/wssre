    <p> Bottom Line: August cross-border flows turned positive for the first time in 26months, suggesting reduced
        capital outflows and improved market sentiment.<br/><br/>
        However, the removal of reserve requirements on FX forward positions onSeptember 8 indicated the PBoC¡¯s fading
        desire for a stronger trade-weightedCNY. We believe that the pace of CNY appreciation will slow and be largely
        afunction of a broad trade-weighted US dollar for the remainder of this year.<br/><br/>
        First monthly inflow since June 2015: FX-denominated outflows came down toUS$4.1bn in August (vs. US$6.3bn in
        July), driven by a narrowed current accountdeficit. Adjusting for forward contract positions, FX-denominated
        settlementturned positive for the first time over the past three years, at US$3.1bn in August(vs. -US$0.03bn in
        July). The RMB-denominated settlement also turned positiveat US$5.8bn (vs. an outflow of US$13.8bn in July). As
        a result, our estimated totalcross-border flows were +US$9bn in August (vs. -US$14bn in July), marking thefirst
        monthly inflow in 26 months.<br/><br/>
        Policymakers eased countercyclical measures at the margin: In light of theimproved cross-border flows and eased
        market expectations of RMBdepreciation, the PBoC removed the 20% reserve requirement on foreignexchange forwards
        on September 8, and cited the reason that CNY has fullypriced in the improved fundamentals and is close to
        equilibrium levels (incomparison, it said CNY diverged from economic fundamentals when it changedthe yuan fixing
        formula on May 26). We believe this move indicates that thePBoC is turning less desirous of strong CNY
        appreciation, as the trade-weightedCNY has appreciated 2.4% since May 26, reversing its loss of 2.5% from
        January 1to May 25 (Exhibit 2).<br/><br/>
        Outlook and policy implications: We expect outflows to remain subdued aspolicymakers would continue with the
        current capital control measures,particularly for overseas investments in the "negative list" ¨C which includes
        realestate, hotel, cinema, media, and sports club businesses. Meanwhile, we believeCNY moves will be largely a
        function of a broad trade-weighted US dollar afterthe PBoC's recent signal (Exhibit 3). Our global FX team
        continues to expectdollar weakness for the remainder of this year, so there would be some room forCNY vs. USD
        appreciation, though likely at a slower pace. CNY strength againstthe USD should fade away if the trade-weighted
        dollar rebounds.</p>
