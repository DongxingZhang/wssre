        It feels like most investors have refused to take a strong view on Bharti and arejust sitting on the sidelines.
        Based on our recent client meetings, it seems thereare a few large holders that are not adding, while the rest
        are staying away,citing sector concerns and risk of a downgrade to HY. This has led to the Bhartibonds moving in
        a tight 20bp range for most of this year (Figure 1). We don¡¯tsee this changing in the near term, however, stick
        with our longer-termfundamental and valuation views.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentals<br/><br/>
        The latest cut in the mobile termination rate (expected to reduce Bharti¡¯sEBITDA by 5% per DB equity research)
        is perhaps the last negative headline onthe fundamental front. This cut combined with RJIO¡¯s recent feature
        phonelaunch could lead to a weak December quarter, though September quarternumbers (to be released in end Oct)
        should be fine. On an organic basis, westick with our long-held belief that Bharti should be able to maintain IG
        ratings.Industry price war is closer to the end than beginning and sector consolidationis also in the final
        stages. Further, as we know, management has publiclyreiterated &amp; demonstrated their commitment to stay IG
        through asset sales,and Bharti has one of the strongest balance sheets &amp; spectrum holdings. Therisk to our
        fundamental view emanates from any inorganic activities ¨C thecouple that have been well flagged in the press
        (Bloomberg) includeacquisition of Tata Teleservices telecom assets and the balance of a stake inIndus Towers.
        But even if either/both of these happen, we trust the companyto structure them in the right manner to protect
        its credit ratings.</p>
