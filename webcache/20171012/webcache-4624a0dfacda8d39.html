    <p> Commentary for Thursday: As we noted about three weeks ago, HurricaneHarvey will impact several key economic
        data series over the next couple ofmonths (see: Potential impacts of Hurricane Harvey on US economic
        data).Unfortunately, since we published that report, Hurricane Irma has batteredsouthern Florida and at present
        Hurricane Maria is wreaking havoc in theCaribbean. As a result, we are downgrading our Q3real GDP growth
        forecast from2.9% to 2.0%. However, most of the lost output in the current quarter should bemade up in Q4and we
        now expect growth of 3.1% compared to 2.4% previously.Q42017/ Q42016real GDP growth remains unchanged at
        2.4%.<br/><br/>
        With respect to the components of GDP, we have lowered current-quarter realPCE growth to 2.0% (vs. 2.6%
        previously). This is consistent with the latest retailsales data, which were soft even if allowing for some
        possible impact due to theweather disruptions. For example, while the drop in auto sales last month couldpartly
        be chalked up to delayed purchases in the Hurricane-impacted regions,retail control, which excludes autos,
        building materials and gasoline stations, wasalso weak. Recall that retail control is a key input into goods
        spending in the GDPaccounts. Through the first two months of the quarter, retail control is up just
        1.3%annualized, the weakest since Q32016. Indeed, the downward revision to the Julycontrol figure pointed to
        modestly less momentum in consumer spending growththan previously anticipated. That said, we anticipate
        inflation-adjusted consumerspending growth to rebound in Q4, rising 2.7% (vs. 2.4% previously).</p>
