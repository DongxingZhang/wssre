        CN: Housing policy tightens in nine cities¡£<br/><br/>
        Since last Friday, nine cities (Chongqing, Nanchang, Nanning, Changsha,Guiyang, Shijiazhuang, Xi¡¯an, Wuhan and
        Wuxi) have announced newregulations in the property market, including sales restrictions and regulation
        ofdevelopers¡¯ sales procedures. The restrictions related mostly to the resale ofproperties within the first
        2-5years after purchase (please refer to p.2for details).We believe the impact on the physical market will be
        immaterial amid the lowinventory level, and may even drive buyers from the secondary to the primarymarket in the
        medium term. However, the announcements of the policytightening in all these cities together convey a negative
        signal of the future policytrend and could dampen overall investor sentiment. (HKET, CFI)¡£</p>
