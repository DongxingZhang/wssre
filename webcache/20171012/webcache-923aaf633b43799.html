    <p> This is what we wrote in our Asia Credit Monthly on Sep 12<br/><br/>
        - ¡°The key for India HY will be a broader macro recovery in our view, so we willbe closely watching how quickly
        the country recovers from the negative effectof one-offs like demonetization and GST. Plus, it's hard to get
        excited on any ofthe sectors - telcos are facing a price war, autos are reeling under higher dealerincentives
        and slowing global sales, real estate has been difficult for a fewyears now, renewables are under renewed
        pressure with declining tariffs andattempts by some SEBs to renegotiate old PPAs.¡±<br/><br/>
        - ¡°China and India remain the wild cards that may disappoint investorexpectations for asset quality recovery and
        improvement in capitalisation.Indian banks and CITIC Limited are the two remaining pockets of likelynegative
        news flow in the financial space ¨C both driven by the deterioratingcapital. This still has not been fully priced
        in and we recommend investors stayUW there.¡±<br/><br/>
        The markets finally appear to be agreeing<br/><br/>
        We have been highlighting our concerns for a while now. But India has been aconsensus long across asset classes
        and our bottom-up view has been takinga back seat. However, the tide finally seems to be turning. Various
        pressreports (including Economic Times) have suggested that the government mightbe launching some fiscal
        stimulus measures to arrest the growth slowdown(two consecutive quarters of sub-6% growth). We believe part of
        this couldalso be driven by populist goals with elections due in less than 2years in 2019.DB economists argued
        in their note on Sep 22that the reported measuresmight increase fiscal deficit for FY18to 3.5-3.7% from the
        targeted 3.2%. Ifthis is the case and assuming it is not a one-off (i.e. continues into FY19), therecould be a
        risk of Moody's changing the positive outlook to stable on thesovereign rating. Separately, our economists think
        RBI is unlikely to pursue aloose monetary policy in conjunction with fiscal stimulus, implying the rate cutcycle
        might be coming to an end for now. Even DB rates and FX team havenow turned negative on the INR, recommending a
        short against the IDR.<br/><br/>
        India credit strategy<br/><br/>
        We have been Underweight India HY since July and reiterate that view.Relatively, we like Indonesia HY and China
        property within Asia HY. We feelmore comfortable with India IG than HY given nature of underlying credits
        andlack of supply in the IG space. Plus, unlike India HY, which has materiallyoutperformed YTD, India IG has
        broadly performed in line with the Asia IGmarkets. Hence, we remain neutral on that front. We acknowledge that
        IG bondsmight also underperform if macro concerns grow, although we could turnconstructive if spreads widen
        15-20bp, especially for the corporates. Within IG,we have been negative on bank fundamentals for a long time,
        though have beencutting losses on our Sell recommendations on account of strong technicals. Westill have three
        Sells vs. zero Buys. On IG corps, our only Buy recommendationcurrently is Bharti Airtel, which as last discussed
        in the note on Sep 21is an IGname trading at HY levels. Please see the Asia Credit Monthly report for full
        listof picks &amp; pans and their risks &amp; rationale.</p>
