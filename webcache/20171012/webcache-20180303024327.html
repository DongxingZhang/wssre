    <p> Run rate accelerated w-o-w, helped by luck: The first 24 days of September yieldedMOP17bn in gross gaming
        revenue (GGR). This implies an average daily run rate (ADR)of MOP757m/day for the past week, compared with
        MOP700m/day the week before andMOP557m/day during the same period last year. Luck played a role in lifting
        ADR.<br/><br/>
        Month-to-date win rate tracks ~3.0% (vs. 2.8% last week) based on our estimates. Bysegment, mass GGR narrowed to
        4% lower vs August while VIP was only down 3%m-o-m. Based on a recent investor trip, VIP continued to track
        ahead of mass especiallygiven the typhoon impact. Operators and industry players deem policy risks are low
        andexpect data to hold up into end of 2017.<br/><br/>
        September to track ~13% y-o-y: Accounting for a potential slowdown ahead of GoldenWeek, we forecast full-month
        GGR to come in at ~MOP20.8bn i.e. MOP630m / day forrest of the month. With that, 3Q17 GGR would come in at ~+6%
        q-o-q, or ~+21% y-o-y.</p>
