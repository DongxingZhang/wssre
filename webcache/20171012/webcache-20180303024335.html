    <p> It¡¯s been nearly six months since the ¡®financial deleveraging¡¯ policy first came toprominence. The combined
        effect of higher interbank rates, tighter liquidity andmultiple prodding efforts from regulators led to sharp
        moves in the market, beforethese quieted down. How should we assess these policies and what are the nextsteps?
        Data suggest that policymakers have achieved some success, as banks pulledback from interbank borrowing (down by
        over RMB2trn from December 2016 levels)and reduced the issuance of interbank certificates of deposit. The stock
        of wealthmanagement products has also declined, including the off-balance sheet portion.<br/><br/>
        After claiming some ¡®low-hanging fruit¡¯, further regulatory reforms are likely.<br/><br/>
        Policymakers, however, have again assured the market recently that they will moveflexibly and cautiously, and be
        mindful of the negative impact on growth. Meanwhile,the overall policy agenda on risk prevention has shifted to
        state-owned enterprises(SOEs). SOEs account for over 70% of corporate debt in China, and 50% of systemwidedebt
        but produce less than a third of economic output. The economic rationaleis overwhelmingly in favour of faster
        debt restructuring. With cuts to overcapacity aswell as recent anti-pollution measures, progress is already
        picking up in heavyindustries. The continued recovery in the manufacturing sector should provideopportunities
        for progress to accelerate after the 19th Party Congress.</p>
