    <p> August data showed a modest pickup. We expect sales growthto decelerate in Sep/Oct given a higher base, slowdown
        inlower tier cities and shortage of saleable resources. For newstarts, we maintain our forecast at +6% for 2017,
        implyingslower YoY growth in new starts in 2H17 vs. 1H17 (+15% YoY).<br/><br/>
        August property sales showed slight YoY growth: Sales grew 2% and 4% involume and value terms, respectively, in
        August 2017, versus 0% and 4% in July2017. Sales MoM growth at 4% in August 2017 is similar to that in 2016, as
        we aremoving to traditional peak season. However, we expect YoY growth to deceleratein Sep/Oct given a higher
        base (Sep/Oct 2016 sales +61%/+38% YoY) and gradualslowdown in lower tier cities demand. Some developers might
        be faced with theissue of shortage of saleable resources in peak season given government pricecap measures.<br/><br/>
        Land market continues to be active: Land transaction area increased by 4% YoYin August vs. 24% YoY in July 2017,
        and the transaction amount rose 51% YoY vs.<br/><br/>
        53% in July. Developers remain hungry for landbanking. The implied land priceper sq m increased 45% YoY in
        August.<br/><br/>
        New starts increased 10% YoY, reversing from negative growth in July: Floorspace new starts grew 10% YoY vs. -3%
        YoY in July 2017. Residential propertyinvestment growth expanded further to 11% YoY vs. 9% YoY in July, given
        activenew starts and land acquisition activity.<br/><br/>
        Completed inventory continues to destock: National completed but unsoldresidential inventory fell a further 3%
        MoM in August 2017 to 332mn sq m vs.<br/><br/>
