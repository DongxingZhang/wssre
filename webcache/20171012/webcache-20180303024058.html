        China¡¯s Caixin PMI rose to six-month high of 51.6 in August (+0.5 MoM).<br/><br/>
        Production rose to meet new order growth, while finished goods inventory fellfor the third consecutive month.
        Input costs (such as steel) increased to eightmonthhigh, but factories were successfully able to pass on
        incremental costs.<br/><br/>
        Commenting on the PMI, Caixin noted improving operating conditions formanufacturing but cautioned that quick
        rise in prices could weigh onprofitability of companies in the middle of the supply chain. (SBB)Investment in
        Mexico¡¯s mining sector expected to increase in 2017 to $5bn(+33% YoY) after 4-years of declining. Expenditures
        peaked in 2012 at $8bn,but waned thereafter on low commodity prices and increased taxes on thesector in 2014.
        However, with the revival of copper (+23% YTD), gold (+15%)and silver (+11%) prices in 2017, spending is
        expected to pick up. A change intax rates could significantly boost investment, as Mexico is currently one of
        themost expensive countries to invest in. (Reuters)US construction spending slips to SAAR of $1.21tn in July
