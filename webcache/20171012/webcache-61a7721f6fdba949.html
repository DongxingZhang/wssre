    <p> RMB100bn sales target in 2019; 3key drivers<br/><br/>
        Management is targeting RMB100bn sales in 2019, suggesting CAGR16-19E of18%. Major drivers include geographical
        expansion, increasing product offeringand deeper penetration of hospital channels. First, the company expanded
        itslogistics network coverage to 30provinces in China, noting 5distribution centersin construction and typically
        smaller base for newer regions. Second, productsinitiated over recent years continue to ramp up, while the
        company developsnew offerings in high-margin segments such as medical devices and nutritionsupplements. Lastly,
        as the company started its direct sales business in 2009,there is plenty of room for sales channel expansion.
        Going forward, managementreaffirms 2H17to outperform 1H17per historical trends, and that over RMB73bnsales can
        be achieved in FY17.<br/><br/>
        Dynamics of DS and IDS under two invoice implementation<br/><br/>
        Indirect sales (IDS) remains high at 44% of total sales as of now, down 1% from45% in 2016. However, management
        also expects IDS to stay at 35% by 2019,as a two invoice policy is unlikely to be strictly implemented in rural
        areas, drugstores and device/consumables. For 1H17, robust growth was attributed partiallyto JT's ability to
        take market share due to the following two changes under thetwo invoices: 1) JT was able to get more contracts
        directly from manufacturers,bypassing JT's previous upstream distributors as those distributors exited the
        IDSbusiness; 2) JT was able to assume more contracts directly from more drug stores,as JT's previous downstream
        distributors exited market.<br/><br/>
        Approximately RMB10bn additional working capital required<br/><br/>
        On liquidity, the working capital to revenue ratio currently stands at 6:1, and isexpected to go up with higher
        hospital concentration. As there is a RMB40bnrevenue gap between the 2019target and revenue in 2016, management
        budgetsRMB10bn in capital requirements and plans to tackle liquidity pressure by raisingRMB3.6bn equity, while
        additional debt can go up to RMB7.2bn. Cost of debt willlikely be around 4-5%.</p>
