    <p> Commodities Day ¨C Environmental protection is the common theme<br/><br/>
        DB Asia hosted its first commodities corporate day in Hong Kong, featuringcompanies across the Oil and Gas,
        Paper, Steel, Aluminum, Lithium, andGlass sectors. We also had experts from Mysteel and Wood Mac, to presenton
        the industry trends in Steel/Iron Ore and on the gas outlook in China.Across the board, China¡¯s policy priority
        to fix the pollution issue and bemore environmentally sensitive was a common theme. Because of the
        Chinesegovernment¡¯s policy to tackle pollution issues, especially during typical smoggywinters, existing heavy
        industrials, such as steel, paper, aluminium, and glassproducers, are seeing strict government execution on
        shutting down pollutingproduction facilities during winter to constrain supply. The Chinese governmentis also
        taking a long-term view to ensure its environmental sustainability and thusis aggressively adopting gas for
        industrial usage and winter heating. Meanwhile,the trend in EV adoption also seems to be promising, due to the
        government¡¯spush, thus allowing lithium companies to continue to be aggressive in terms ofexpansion.<br/><br/>
        Energy sectors - Oil &amp; Gas should be a top sector to own into 4Q17<br/><br/>
        In the energy complex, cost-cutting continues, while 3Q17is shaping up tobe a strong quarter with the rebound in
        oil prices, inventory gains in refiningand a rebound in chemical spreads due to Hurricane Harvey. Wood Mac
        alsocommented on the strong demand outlook for gas in China, particularly in 4Q18,with rapid coal-to-gas
        switching as the main driver. We believe CNOOC and COSLshould offer the best risk/reward over the next
        6-12months in the energy mix. Forthe coal sector, the Chinese government¡¯s initiatives for pressing coal prices
        andcoal-to-gas switches during winter might continue to haunt sentiment on coalstocks, even though we think
        China Shenhua¡¯s valuation is undemanding. TheLithium sector should continue its secular story, though we believe
        the near-termvaluation of Tianqi is too stretched.<br/><br/>
        Oil and Gas ¨C Recovery for oil and promising outlook for gas<br/><br/>
        In Oil &amp; Gas, key themes were around the oil recovery and cost-cutting measures,and strong gas demand growth
        and pipeline tariff reform. Chinese oil companiesexpect oil price recovery to continue with healthy demand
        growth, while theyanticipate overall E&amp;P; profitability improving, with stringent control on
        costsparticularly on lifting costs. Among the big three, CNOOC is the most aggressiveon cost-cutting with the
        all-in cost declining to US$33/boe, Sinopec aims to lowerthe all-in cost to US$55/boe (vs. US$62-63/boe
        currently), and PetroChina expectsthe cash cost to be lowered to US$11/boe, though DD&amp;A; could be higher,
        leaving its all-in-cost at c.USD47.5/boe. Gas demand in China could exceed expectationswith PetroChina
        anticipating 12% growth in 2017during its interim briefing. AnRMB10cents cut in the end-user gas price induces
        more industrial users toswitch from coal to gas. Moreover, the new distance-based transmission tariffallows
        pipeline companies to conduct "two-way" gas transmission with variousgas sources and to lift utilization rates
        for gas pipelines.</p>
