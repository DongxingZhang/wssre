        On 19Sep 2017, Gree confirmed it had teamed up with Luoyang LocalGovernment and IIT Committee of Henan province,
        to participate in the ¡°Luoyangintelligent equipment manufacturing production base project¡±, reported by thepress
        on 15Sep 2017. Total investment of this project is around RMB15bnincluding a site area of 5000mu, and the
        estimated production value will reachRMB30bn per annum after completion. Gree will also participate in the
        stateownedenterprise Reform of LYC Bearing; the investment amount from Gree hasyet to be defined. The company
        will make a further announcement if necessary.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, Gree<br/><br/>
        denied it intended to acquire Tianjin FAW Xiali as Souhu.comreported on 16Sep 2017. Gree clarified that it has
        never discussed the acquisitionof Xiali with Tianjin FAW.<br/><br/>
        Event 2- Acquisition of 5% stake in Shanghai Highly Group<br/><br/>
        Gree resumed trading on 19Sep and announced on 20Sep 2017that it hadsuccessfully bid for 43m shares of Shanghai
        Highly Group (600619.SS, NR)between 29Aug 2017and 19Sep 2017from its controlling shareholder, ShanghaiElectric
        Group (601727.SS, NR). Following the purchase, Gree owns a 5% stakein Shanghai Highly.<br/><br/>
        Rationale for the purchase ¨C to be an international company with well-rounded<br/><br/>
        supply chain capability. Through this acquisition, Gree targets to expand itssupply chain base and consolidate
        quality capacity and resources in the market.It will also leverage on its international vision as a Shanghai
        company, on humanresources, information and innovation.It also mentioned the possibility of increasing its stake
        in Shanghai Highly in thenext 12months, although it does not intend to be the controlling shareholder ofHighly
        at the moment. It stated that: 1) it will not sell the purchased shares in thenext 12months; 2) it will continue
        to participate in the bidding for Highly¡¯s sharesin the next 12months should Highly¡¯s controlling shareholder,
        Shanghai Electric,plan to sell its stake in Highly.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C maintaining Buy<br/><br/>
        We believe that business diversification remains as one of the key strategies forGree, and is in line with what
        it mentioned in its 2016annual report. Automationin the manufacturing process is one of the focuses for all
        upstream players. In1H17, Gree's manufacturing equipment business sales grew by 270%. As theinvestment of
        RMB15bn will be contributed by various partners, we believe Gree'sinvestment in Luoyang LYC can be funded from
        internal resources and will notaffect Gree's cashflow or dividend payout. To recap, as of end-2016, Gree hasnet
        cash of RMB84bn including net working capital. In 2016, its dividend payoutratio was 59%.<br/><br/>
        Gree bought its<br/><br/>
        interest in Highly at a price of RMB11.6-15.5/share (withinHighly's trading range during the period), which
        indicates Gree¡¯s total investmentinto Highly is around RMB556-578m. The consideration implies a 2016PE of63-66x,
        EV/EBITDA of 11~12x, PB of 2.8-2.9x. The impact on the P&amp;L; should bevery minimal, in our view. The reason
        for this acquisition is mainly to verticallyintegrate its supply chain, as explained by Gree. Shanghai Highly is
        the leadingcompressor manufacturer in China with a 31.4% share of non-self-supportingcompressors in 1H17,
        according to Highly's interim report. As the largest clientfor Highly, Gree purchased 6m sets of compressors
        from Highly (total productionof 25m sets) in 2016. Other air conditioners, e.g., Midea and Haier, are all
        clientsof Highly. Gree also owns a compressor manufacturer, i.e., Zhuhai Landa, asubsidiary of Gree. We believe
        the investment in Highly will further secure Gree¡¯scompressor supply and help it to gain market share and
        strengthen its dominantposition in the air-conditioner market, particularly in a high demand market.</p>
