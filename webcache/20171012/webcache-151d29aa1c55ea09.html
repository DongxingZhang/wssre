    <p> Healthcare, POSCO and Kepco were key areas discussed。<br/><br/>
        During our conversation with 34investors in Asia last week, investorsdisplayed the most interest in the
        following order: Korea Healthcare excludingHanmi Pharm, POSCO, and Kepco. Some clients wanted to know whether
        theNAV discount of Samsung C&amp;T; could narrow on the back of earnings recoveryand expanding investment asset
        values. Despite many Korean steel sectorrelatedtopics being covered during the meetings, Hyundai Steel was not
        amajor part of discussions, given investors' concern on captive clients, relatedto plunging production in China.
        Kogas did not attract much interest from assetmanagers, due to limited upside in oil prices with regard to E&amp;P;
        earnings.。<br/><br/>
        Healthcare: limited fundamental reasons for Korean biosimilar sector¨s upsurge。<br/><br/>
        Most investors held the following view on Korea biosimilars: a) recent hikes inSamsung Biologics and Celltrion
        have thin support from a fundamental pointof view, b) competition in both CMO and biosimilar businesses will be
        gettingtougher, and c) valuations are stretched despite generous assumptions. Wereiterate our bearish view on
        Korean biosimilars, as we note catalysts will beexhausted and the print related to sell-through revenue will not
        grow enoughto give investors relief in H1-18. We sensed divided feedback on Medytox.Though some remain bullish,
        with the increased capacity targeting the US andChina markets, others are worried about lack of progress in
        Innotox's clinicaltrial in the US, competition in Korea from Medytox¨s capacity addition in July,and tensions
        with China, if any, which could lead to revenue downside.。<br/><br/>
        Steel: balanced view from investors。<br/><br/>
        In contrast to the positive bias of the feedback received during marketing inAsia, US and Europe in Q1, it
        appears that investors in Hong Kong andSingapore remain neutral, given (a bull case) the continuing expectation
        for aseasonal supply cut in the winter season and (a bear case) downside risks onsteel-making materials and
        regional steel prices. We highlight a re-ratingwithout upward earnings revisions is unlikely at the current
        valuation of 0.6xPBR and 6% ROE, which is based on historical context. Therefore, we wouldsuggest investors
        focus on earnings upside with higher OP/t from expandingspreads, if any, in the event of stronger
        demand.。<br/><br/>
        Utilities: downside largely protected, but limited catalysts。<br/><br/>
        We pitched our Buy recommendation on Kepco. After uncertainty in relation topolicy measures disappears with the
        first results of the Shin-Gori #5,6publiccommittee on 20October and the 8th power development plan at the end
        ofthis year, we believe the Street will recognize that the (ROE) profile will bedifferent from policy direction
        thanks to: a) stable commodity prices in 2018,and b) better generation mix with three new nuclear power plants
        in 2018-20and nine thermal power plants in 2016-17, as well as no risk of tariff cuts forthe time being. Most
        fund managers seemed to accept our view that Kepcohas limited downside, but did not identify any catalyst in the
        near term.。<br/><br/>
        Samsung C&amp;T;: interest level is rising。<br/><br/>
        In the midst of earnings recovery, investors thought the divergence betweenSamsung C&amp;T; and Samsung
        Biologics/Samsung Electronics too wide to bejustified in valuation terms. We highlighted that earnings should be
        stablethanks to a higher affiliate portion in construction and completed restructuring.。</p>
