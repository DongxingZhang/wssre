    <p> The government's economic policies aim at guaranteeing basic livingstandard for all. These include not only a
        big boost in (minimum) wages,living allowances and (public sector) jobs, but also cuts in the costs of
        certainliving necessities. Despite its expansionary budget plan, we do not see thegovernment's debt rising
        meaningfully during President Moon's term. However,Korea's demographic headwinds do call for the government to
        commit to alegally binding fiscal rule to ensure its fiscal sustainability.<br/><br/>
        The government seems well on its way to achieving its socio-economic policyagenda ¨C guaranteeing basic living
        standard for all. Its budget plan seeks arelatively higher spending growth of 5.8% in 2017-21, vs. the 4.2% rise
        plannedfor 2016-20. In particular, this growth is led by welfare spending, which will see anannual average
        growth of 9.8% in 2017-21, up sharply from the previous mediumtermplan of 6.9%. This would leave the welfare
        spending share of the budgetsharply higher at 38% in 2021, up from 32% in 2016and 28% in 2012. (Pleasesee Figure
        1on page 3for details.) Moreover, the government has introduceda number of redistributive policies, including a
        more progressive tax system,to help finance its spending. Despite the more expansionary spending plan,the
        government¡¯s debt is unlikely to rise excessively during President Moon'sterm, barring unexpected external
        shocks. Even with less optimistic assumptions(taking the past five years' nominal average GDP growth of 4.2% and
        revenuegrowth of 4.9% as our guidance, vs. the government¡¯s assumptions of 5.6% and5.5%, respectively), we
        expect the government debt to be well contained, at42.3% of GDP in 2021, only slightly higher than the
        government's projection of40.4% of GDP.<br/><br/>
        South Korea¡¯s long-term fiscal prospects remain a source of concern,however, given its rapidly ageing population
        and expanding welfare benefits.In fact, President Moon's successor is likely to see government debt rise
        sharplyduring his term to reach around 49% of GDP in 2026, as Korea enters a superagedera, with the population
        share of those 65years and older at 21%. Thisshare would rise further to 33% in 2040from 23% in 2030, then to
        41% in2060. The National Health Insurance Service expects a deficit from next year,while Employment Insurance
        sees this happening in 2020, after Long-term CareInsurance reported deficit since last year. By its own
        estimate, the governmentsaw the National Pension Services reporting a deficit from 2044. This will
        requirebroad-based tax increases and cuts to discretionary spending to ensure fiscalsustainability. To ensure
        confidence in its finances, the government might committo a fiscal rule, like that in Germany or the EU. Without
        a legally bindingcommitment and even without higher welfare benefits, the National Assembly'sBudget Office
        forecasts that government debt will double to 80% of GDP in 2040,</p>
