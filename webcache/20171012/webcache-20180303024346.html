    <p> The recent reduction in termination rates announced by the regulator of 58% to 6paisas from the current 14
        paisas has not come as a big surprise as we were alreadybuilding for a 3 paisa decline in our base case for
        incumbent telcos. We believe themove will definitely hurt the near- to medium-term profitability of incumbent
        telcos andmore importantly will allow 4G-entrant Jio (not listed) to be more aggressive as itaddresses concerns
        over its near-term profitability. In our update report Indian Telecoms¨C Termination rate review to decide sector
        tariffs of 7 August 2017, we highlighted thatJio could see its EBITDA margin double if termination rates were
        reduced by half. Withthe actual reduction being 58%, this suggests a sharp jump in EBITDA margins is likelyfor
        Jio over next 12 months. However, our aforesaid analysis assumes a steady ARPUincrease. Given Jio¡¯s aspirations
        of a 50% market share, it is possible that Jio may usethe lower termination rate to maintain cheap prices and
        defer any price increases.<br/><br/>
        For the sector, a lot depends on how Jio perceives its wireless business in thecontext of its overall
        investments, including fibre to home, online content and cable TVservices. The Indian residential broadband
        market is supply starved, significantlyfragmented and mostly served by balance sheet-constrained cable TV
        players. Weunderstand that Jio is making good progress with its fibre-to-home rollout in metromarkets/cities at
        the least and that this space is not seeing any meaningful investmentfrom the incumbent telcos. As such, Jio
        stands a chance to benefit from lowercompetitive intensity and its rapid move to profitability in the home
        broadband space.<br/><br/>
        Moreover, Jio is likely to add more services to broadband, including cable TV, homesecurity and surveillance,
        and this may take care of ARPU issues that the purebroadband players have been struggling with. The incumbent
        telcos are balance-sheetconstrained; although Bharti appears to be better off, we believe it does not haveenough
        flexibility to make big investments in wireline unless it were able to monetize itstower/Africa assets soon. If
        Jio were to gain a 12% market share in the residentialbroadband space, we estimate that it would add at least
        cUSD1.3bn annually to itsEBITDA and that it could choose to remain disruptive in wireless, limiting upside
        forincumbents. Furthermore, a strategy to capture metro markets/cities earlier may limitincentives for late
        entrants to capture the low-ARPU markets.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Hold rating on Bharti and cut our DCF-based SOTP-driven TP to INR385from INR400 and maintain Reduce
        rating on Idea and cut our DCF-based SOTPdrivenTP to INR73 from INR77. We cut our EPS estimates for FY19 by 9%
        for Idea andby 9.3% for Bharti to factor in the lower termination rates. For our discussion on risks,please
