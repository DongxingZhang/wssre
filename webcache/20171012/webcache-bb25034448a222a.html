        Chinese Banks - China's credit card boom?<br/><br/>
        The eight joint-stock banks (JSBs) we cover have released 1H17 results and it<br/><br/>
        is worth noting that all of them reported faster growth in the credit card<br/><br/>
        business. With receivable accelerating to 43% yoy and fees up 51% yoy, credit<br/><br/>
        card revenue has contributed 20% of JSB¡¯s revenue in 1H17 (2016: 16%). This<br/><br/>
        partly explains the recent surge in China¡¯s short-term consumer debt, which is<br/><br/>
        now growing at 34-35% yoy (see report China¡¯s consumer debt boom). The<br/><br/>
        stronger credit card business should boost banks¡¯ revenue in the near term,<br/><br/>
        but it is unlikely to fully offset the deleveraging pressure faced by JSBs, and<br/><br/>
        the asset quality and growth sustainability will be tested in coming years.<br/><br/>

        China Cinda - 1H17 results: initial read¡£<br/><br/>
        China Cinda reported 1H17 results with net income of Rmb8.9bn, up 11% yoy<br/><br/>
        but 25% behind our forecast. We calculate recurrent profit (excl. Rmb3.4bn<br/><br/>
        disposal gains on P&amp;C; sub) was Rmb6.5bn, down 19% yoy. TDA income was<br/><br/>
        strong (up 90% yoy) but RDA business missed on both yield and asset quality<br/><br/>
        (225bps credit cost vs. 67bps in 2016). Cinda reported other DES disposal<br/><br/>
        gains as Rmb3.3bn lower than 1H16, being another major drag on the results.<br/><br/>
        We understand the company may intend to set aside more provision using the<br/><br/>
        P&amp;C; disposal gains, but think the market may react negatively to the results.<br/><br/>
        Meantime, we hope to seek management¡¯s comment around RDA outlook and<br/><br/>
        investment income movement during the analyst briefing on Aug 30 morning.<br/><br/>
