    <p> We estimate 2/3to consumption, 1/3to home equity loans<br/><br/>
        There is a notable trend in past months that China¡¯s short-term consumer debthas suddenly been picking up to
        around 35% yoy and making up c.10% of netnew credit creation (see report China¡¯s consumer debt boom). What
        puzzled usand the market is where this short-term credit was deployed. Our studies showthat the growth of
        short-term consumer debt was mainly driven by decentconsumption growth (c.2/3of Rmb1.4tr new consumption loans
        YTD), ashouseholds are borrowing more to buy autos and other goods online, decoratenew homes and travel. The
        other one-third is home equity loans, which were tofinance purchases of second homes under stricter home
        purchase restrictions.<br/><br/>
        Stable but decent growth in consumer goods partly explains the story<br/><br/>
        We looked at the recent sales growth of major consumer goods and servicesthat may need short-term financing e.g.
        automobiles, online sales, homedecoration, home appliances and travel etc. Most of these consumer goodsdelivered
        stable, but decent growth of high-single digit to mid-teens yoy salesvolume. Meanwhile, the penetration of
        credit in consuming these goods andservices is rising steadily. Credit cards are clearly the key measure to
        obtainbank credit for consumption purposes, with the loan balance amounting toRmb4.7tr as of June 2017, up 31%
        yoy (see our report China¡¯s credit cardboom for details). In our view, the underlying drivers include
        structuralconsumption upgrades, changes in consumer behavior and also wealth effectsfrom property price
        increases.<br/><br/>
        c.Rmb400bn YTD to finance purchases of property<br/><br/>
        Nonetheless, consumption growth with rising credit penetration does not fullyexplain the sudden pick-up in
        short-term consumer debt growth. Reflectingstricter home purchase restrictions, some home buyers were required
        to pay ahigher proportion of the transaction amount as a downpayment and hence,were forced to turn to other
        financing channels to obtain home equity loans,such as banks¡¯ unsecured consumer lending. We estimate that in
        8M17, therewas approximately Rmb400bn of new consumer loans that were used tofinance purchases of property. We
        believe the risks related to property-relatedfinancing are limited. The size is small, as Rmb400bn only makes up
        1% oftotal consumer debt. More importantly, the financing is supported by genuineupgrade demand rather than
        investment or speculation demand. The PBOC¡¯scredit data system and banks¡¯ proactive post-lending management
        should alsorelieve the risks.<br/><br/>
        Expecting ST consumer loans to slow, but at decent growth; Buy retail banks<br/><br/>
        Regulators in various municipalities including Beijing, Shenzhen and Jiangsuhave warned of the risks of illegal
        home equity loans and released guidelinesto rein in the aggressive expansion. As such, we expect short-term
        consumerloans to slow in the coming months, but still at a decent growth rate asconsumption growth is likely to
        remain resilient. Banks with faster growth inconsumption loans are likely to be subject to regulatory risks. We
        remainpositive on the big banks, as they have the strongest retail banking franchiseamong peers, with less
        property-related lending. Our top picks remain ICBCand BOC.</p>
