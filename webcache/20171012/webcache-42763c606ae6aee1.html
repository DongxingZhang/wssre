    <p> Though we remain optimistic that a new business cycle is rolling back around, we believe now is thetime to take
        profit on cyclical sector investments, and await new opportunities to reinvest in thecyclical sector, as we are
        concerned over the potential for a retreat in cyclical stock valuations in thecoming two quarters.<br/><br/>
        August macro figures. Many argue August macro data came in much lower than expectation, wefind out that
        infrastructure plays a large role, and real estate and industrial investment are bothquite weak. With both
        supply side (manufacturing investment) and demand side (fixed assetinvestment) show weakness in August, we are a
        little bit concern about the future, as the higherbase effect and weak infrastructure would gradually harm the
        looking of the macro figures in thecoming quarter.<br/><br/>
        Price hike not sustainable. As we have communicated with investors, price hike supported bysupply-side reform
        and environmental regulation is the major driver for the cyclical sector rally, forthe market believes that
        price hike both reflect demand to be better than expectation, and betterearning for up-stream manufacturers.
        However, in reality, to keep price hike sustainable, theremust be stricter environmental regulation among
        industries. Moreover, as per our analysis on priceand investment, price hike in 2017 has become negative to
        manufacturing investment. Therefore,for the future, there are two possible scenarios: material price stop
        rising, or material pricecontinue to hike, further harming the demand, leading to a price halt or price drop.
        For eitherscenario, the price hike is not sustainable, thus the cyclical sector rally of this round is
        notsustainable.<br/><br/>
        Market misunderstanding the driver. As we have mentioned in out September outlook, Juneoutlook, and May outlook,
        the driver for continuing recovery comes from market clearance, supplyshortfall, and industrial investment
        demand improvement. While the market believe in price hikeand margin expansion driven by supply-side reform,
        which would eventually lead to the temporaryfall of both supply and demand, a negative sign for recovery. It
        might take time before the marketrealize that the clearance and recovery of investment demand to be the major
        driver for cyclicalrally in the coming new cycle.<br/><br/>
        No further support before 2018Q2. Our accumulating depreciation fixed-asset model introduced inSeptember outlook
        suggest that the new cycle might start in 2Q2018, due to strong marginalimprovement of utilisation rate in
        3Q2017 (utilisation rate leads investment for 3Q in China). Before2Q2018, however, our model do not suggest any
        upside potential from industrial investmentdemand, which can become a pressure upon sentiment.<br/><br/>
        Take profit on cyclical names. We suggest investors to take profit on cyclical sector investments,and,
        accordingly, we lower the pro-cyclical exposure of our Conviction BUY portfolio. We cut ourweighting of Sinotruk
        (3808:HK - BUY) by 7ppts, Nine Dragons Paper (2689:HK - BUY) by 5ppts, CIMCEnric (3899:HK 每 BUY) by 2ppts and
        Anhui Conch (914:HK - BUY) by 1ppt. We add to our portfolioCSPC Pharmaceutical (1093:HK 每 O-PF) with a 3%
        weighting and Yongda Auto (3669:HK 每 BUY) witha 4% weighting, and raise our weighting on ENN Energy (2688:HK -
        BUY), New Oriental Education &amp;Technology; (EDU:US 每 BUY) and Huaneng Renewables (958:HK - BUY) by over 3ppts
        each.</p>
