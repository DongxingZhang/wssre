    <p> Online business in two different business lines, with a solid start for both<br/><br/>
        'XRS at Home' has been developed by the 'XRS Peiyou' business line, while the'IDO' system is driven by the 'XRS
        online' business line. The former mainlyleverages city-level local teaching resources to serve students who
        alreadyhave good understanding of the subjects but prefer to save time on logistics.The latter mainly leverages
        the centralized teaching resources in Beijing toserve students that are urgently looking for high-quality
        teachers all over thecountry. Both are currently using the 'live broadcasting + double teacher'model. Going
        forward, 'XRS at Home' will work closely with local content,while 'IDO' will focus more on new technology like
        VR.<br/><br/>
        Internal competition is good for developing new initiatives<br/><br/>
        ¡®XRS online¡¯ previously used recorded content among rich coverage ofsubjects to attract students. In the process
        of competing with ¡®Haibian livebroadcasting¡¯, ¡®XRS online¡¯ evolved into a better model by adding more
        livebroadcasting content and more teacher assistants. In addition, ¡®XRS online¡¯ putmore focus on new technology
        like IMS, VR and expression recognition. ¡®IDO¡¯is the new highlight of ¡®XRS online¡¯.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, in order to better compete with ¡®XRS online¡¯, ¡®Haibian livebroadcasting¡¯ merged with ¡®XRS Peiyou¡¯ and
        was rebranded as ¡®XRS at Home¡¯.Live broadcast of content by city-level resources, intensive service from
        localteacher assistants, and more closed local study groups help to attract localstudents. Going forward, ¡®XRS
        at Home¡¯ will continue to better leverage localstrength to compete with ¡®XRS online¡¯. We believe these two
        business linesalready show differentiation and decreased overlap. ¡®XRS online¡¯ can attractlower-tier markets
        that do not have enough teachers in local cities, while ¡®XRSonline¡¯ could target students in higher-tier markets
        who are more focused andprefer to save travel time. In total, we expect online revenue to contribute morethan
        10% of TAL¡¯s total revenue in FY21.</p>
