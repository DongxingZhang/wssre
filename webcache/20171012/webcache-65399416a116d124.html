    <p> Real exports solid: The August BoJ real exports, which indicate exports on avolume basis (announced 2pm), showed
        growth picking up to +3.0% MoM(Exhibit2). Jul-Sep real exports to date are up at a solid pace of +3.3%
        QoQ,indicating solid global demand. Estimates by region are released later, butlooking at the Cabinet Office¡¯s
        export volume index by region, we see solidgrowth trend in exports to the US and Asia.<br/><br/>
        Export values up sharply YoY: We focus on trends in the seasonally adjustedreal exports (volume) when looking at
        the overall economy, but in terms ofearnings at exporting companies and the impact on share prices, YoY moves
        inthe yen-based export value is also crucial. The August yen-based export value inMoF¡¯s trade data shows export
        value up 18.1% YoY, rising for nine straightmonths and marking the strongest growth in nearly four years since
        Nov 2013.<br/><br/>
        That said, this was partly because of the YoY base effect from a weaker yen: Theaverage forex rate disclosed by
        the Directors-General of Custom-Houses back inAugust 2016 stood at £¤103.24/$ partly due to the impact of Brexit,
        but the yenweakened to £¤110.77/$ in Aug 2017, which boosted yen-denominated exportvalues. See Exhibits 4-7 for
        YoY trends in top export items by value to keyregions.<br/><br/>
        Real imports mixed: Real imports in August continued to be mixed at +0.8%MoM. Real imports for Jul-Sep is
        running at a nearly flat pace of -0.3% QoQ fornow. Imports will very likely recover mildly ahead reflecting the
        recovery indomestic demand.<br/><br/>
        Next external demand contribution to lift Jul-Sep GDP: Reflecting the Augusttrade data, we estimate that net
        external demand contribution (exports minusimports) in the Jul-Sep GDP (1st prelim Nov 15) is currently up
        around +1.4%ptQoQ SAAR (or around +0.3%pt QoQ), boosting real GDP growth. While theprojection could change
        depending on the data ahead, unlike the Apr-Jun GDP,where net external demand contribution came in negative
        driven by domesticdemand, we expect the renewed upturn in net external demand contribution toshore up GDP growth
        for Jul-Sep. We now see an increasing likelihood that Jul-Sep real GDP would show positive growth for seven
        consecutive quarters, even ifdomestic demand contribution was marginally positive.</p>
