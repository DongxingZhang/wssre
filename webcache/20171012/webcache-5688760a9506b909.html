        Natural Gas: Benchmark price cut to lower cost for downstream and benefit environmentalrenovation companies<br/><br/>
        The latest Rmb0.1/m3cut in the benchmark gate station natural gas price for non-residential usersis likely to
        reduce downstream companies¡¯ gas cost by Rmb16bn. Central government departmentsissued an action plan in Aug
        regarding air pollution control in Jingjinji during the winter of 2017and2018. Replacing the use of coal with
        natural gas is a key means to this end, and cheaper gas priceshave made coal-to-gas substitution more
        economically practical. We expect clean heat supplyfacilities renovation to speed up in the Jingjinji region.
