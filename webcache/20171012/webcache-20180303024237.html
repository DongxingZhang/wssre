        Return to shareholder cash return?<br/><br/>
        As evidenced by APC's (APC.N) announced share buyback program last week,investor (and by extension corporate)
        focus has begun to shift towards unlockinga path towards sustainably driving shareholder value (even at the
        expense ofgrowth), offering a sharp contrast to an industry that traditionally (and almostexclusively) captured
        value through accelerating the recovery of resource via thedrill-bit. We look forward to discussions with
        management teams on the extentto which this ideologic shift in value creation has begun to permeate board
        rooms(or whether it evaporates when crude passes $55/bbl), how the corporates arelikely to respond to
        potentially increased pressure from shareholders to dial-updistributions (and free cash flow) as well as broader
        implications for the macro(US oil growth), A&amp;D;, and a renewed appetite for conventional, FCF
        generatingassets.</p>
