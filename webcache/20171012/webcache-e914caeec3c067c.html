    <p> As the fourth quarter approaches, we are entering what should be the finalstretch of the selection process for a
        possible new Fed chair. Not surprisingly, thefrequency of both news stories on the subject and lists of
        potential candidatesemanating from somewhere near the White House has been on the rise of late.<br/><br/>
        Four names have come up that warrant further attention. The first three of thesefour names featured prominently
        in a piece we put out seven months ago.1The first is Janet Yellen. She continues to be listed as someone the
        Presidentis seriously considering, and as we observed in a recent Fed note, her remarksat the September FOMC
        press conference came across to us as suggesting shewould happily accept reappointment.2 This outcome would
        clearly be the onewith least disruption to the markets ¨C four more years of the Fed being led undervery
        effective Yellen stewardship.<br/><br/>
        The second is Jerome (Jay) Powell, current Fed governor, a Republican, andsomeone who has learned the monetary
        policy trade well during his more thanfive-year term at the Board so far. Powell has Republican credentials,
        knows theBoard and FOMC well, and while not a PhD-trained economist a la Yellen andBernanke, has impressed with
        his grasp of monetary economics in his speechesand public presentations. We suspect that a Powell-led Fed would
        not be a largestep away from a Yellen-led Fed and would thus represent policy continuity formarkets.<br/><br/>
        The third, and perhaps most interesting, because a fair amount is known abouthim and he could represent some
        shift in direction for the Fed in the coming years,is Kevin Warsh. Today, press reports noted that Trump and his
        economic adviserswere slated to meet with Warsh and several other (unnamed) candidates. Warsh,too, has
        significant Fed experience including during the crisis years as a memberof the Fed¡¯s Board; he also has ample
        private / market experience.<br/><br/>
        While in the private sector (including at Stanford University) Warsh has not shiedfrom being openly critical of
        the Fed. His criticisms are often nuanced, makingit difficult to draw direct implications for how monetary
        policy could be differentunder his leadership, but our sense is that he would come down on the hawkishside of
        the current leadership. For one, he has been critical of the size of the Fed¡¯s balance sheet, suggesting that it
        poses risk of "fiscal dominance" ¨C potentialfor fiscal policy to drive monetary policy decisions. Also, one of
        his clearestcomments on monetary policy came in a January article in the Wall Street Journal,where he said:
        "..the Fed should establish an inflation objective of around 1% to2%, with a band of acceptable outcomes. The
        current 2.0% inflation target offersfalse precision.¡±3 With inflation currently in the middle of this range,
        there is notmuch room to hold the line on rate increases as it recovers from recent one-offnegative influences.
        In short, we would expect Warsh to be at least as hawkishas Yellen and Powell if inflation began to rise faster
        than expected.</p>
