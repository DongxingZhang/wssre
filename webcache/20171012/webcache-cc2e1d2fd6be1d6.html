    <p> We have had a neutral view on Asia credit since our 2H Outlook on June 1,arguing that it will largely be a carry
        play. This has more or less played out withthe overall spreads almost unchanged. We have also argued that the
        carry willbe volatile, which hasn¡¯t really been the case with the Markit Asia cash indexmoving in a very small
        10bp range despite all the headlines around us. To befair, the HY range has been 50bp vs. 15bp for IG. As for
        the headlines, we arecertainly not done yet. Even with the ECB almost proving to be a non-eventlast week and the
        US debt ceiling debate pushed back to December, we havea string of them lined up for September ¨C FOMC, German
        elections, NorthKorea headlines, and a heavy supply pipeline. But again, none of these shouldlead to a major
        negative surprise, at least not in our base case. If our base caseplays out, we would not be surprised to see
        spreads resume their tighteningbias sometime in October. In the meantime, they should stay range
        bound.<br/><br/>
        With fundamentals supportive and technicals strong, tight valuations areperhaps justified. Our biggest fear is
        the "unknown" - some negative catalystthat most of us don't foresee currently - similar to what has happened in
        thepast major crisis episodes ¨C though this is likely a 2018 event.</p>
