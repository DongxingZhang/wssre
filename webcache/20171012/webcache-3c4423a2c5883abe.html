    <p> Brent crude has recovered by ~USD10/b from its June low. While the weakness inthe US dollar has undoubtedly been
        a factor, we think price strength also reflects anumber of pointers that the oil market continues to
        rebalance.<br/><br/>
        The strength of demand has been a key feature with 2Q17 y/y demand growth thestrongest since mid-2015. While 3Q
        demand will be adversely affected by the recentUS hurricanes, 2017 still looks set to be an extremely strong
        year.<br/><br/>
        US production is set to continue growing strongly for now, not least thanks to a likelyfall in the number of
        drilled uncompleted wells (DUCs). However, after a &gt;140% jumpfrom its 2016 lows, the US rig count peaked in
        August and has since fallen slightly.<br/><br/>
        This reinforces our view that current rates of US supply growth are unlikely to besustainable longer term
        without a material rise in US crude prices from recent levels.<br/><br/>
        OPEC supply fell slightly in August with improved compliance and a drop in Libyanoutput from its recent peak,
        but the net cut vs pre-agreement levels is still less than0.5mbd. The OPEC agreement runs to end-1Q18, but we
        believe it could beextended if global inventories remain in excess by that stage.<br/><br/>
        Recent US inventory data is hard to interpret given the effects of the hurricanes, butit is clear that a
        significant amount of the global surplus has been eliminated. As ofend-July, the OECD inventory surplus stood at
        around 7% vs the five-year average,vs 12% at the peak early this year.<br/><br/>
        We remain convinced of longer-term upside to crude prices. With the lack of newmajor project sanctions, we
        expect conventional non-OPEC supply to start decliningpost-2018. Even with growth in OPEC supply, we think this
        points to the need forsustained growth in short-cycle US tight oil well beyond 2017-18 in order to meetglobal
        demand. Without materially higher prices in the longer term, we are notconvinced that this sustained growth is
        deliverable.<br/><br/>
        We have marked to market our 3Q Brent price assumption, bringing it down fromUSD54/b to USD52/b. This brings our
        FY17e assumption down from USD55/b toUSD54.4/b, but our longer-term assumptions remain unchanged at an average
        Brentprice of USD65/b in 2018e and USD70/b in 2018e. While any reversal of the recentUSD weakness would pose
        downside risks to prices in the short term, we think thefundamentals are becoming increasingly supportive.</p>
