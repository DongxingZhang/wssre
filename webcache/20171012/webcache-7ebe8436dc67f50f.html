    <p> Recent press reports (The Economic Times, Business Standard) suggest that thegovernment is contemplating
        providing a ¡°fiscal stimulus¡± to support near termgrowth momentum, which has weakened particularly in the last
        two quarters(sub-6% real GDP growth). This can potentially increase the central government¡¯sfiscal deficit to
        3.5-3.7% of GDP in FY18, from the budgeted 3.2% target (3.5% ofGDP achieved in FY17), depending on the size of
        the stimulus (0.3-0.5% of GDP).<br/><br/>
        This would be a setback to the fiscal consolidation momentum that was enduredthrough the past few
        years.<br/><br/>
        Likely RBI reaction. Fiscal slippage risks (both at the central and state financeslevel) will naturally make the
        RBI more cautious and defensive regarding theirmonetary policy stance and probably mark an end to the ongoing
        rate cuttingcycle. With inflation expected to inch up above 4% in the 1Q of 2018, US balancesheet unwinding
        program ready to take off, and domestic fiscal outlook shroudedin uncertainty, a forward looking inflation
        targeting central bank will naturallywant to maintain a cautious stance, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Rupee. In our view, both RBI and the government will not be overly concerned bythe recent bout of rupee
        depreciation which has pushed INR/USD above the 65mark. On the contrary, the extent of rupee appreciation
        (particularly in real terms)was turning out to be a source of concern, given its adverse impact on exportsand
        overall growth. INR/USD was close to 69 last November and since then hasappreciated to lower than 64 levels, led
        by a weak Dollar. In this context, theretracement back to 65 levels should be seen as a healthy correction and
        possiblyfavorable for the exports and growth dynamic.</p>
