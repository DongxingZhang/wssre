    <p> Economics Focus: In Asia, we expect CBSL to hike while BoT stays on hold; Vietnam¡¯s growth is likely to
        accelerate amid mixed inflation and trade data. In EMEA, both the CNB and CBE are likely to keep rates on hold,
        we expect Polish CPI inflation to accelerate to 1.9% YoY in September. In Brazil, watch for signs confirming low
        inflation, low CAD and possible uptick in collection. Focus is on Colombia, where BanRep will debate between
        pausing or easing (we expect 4.0% terminal rate).<br/><br/>
        Strategy Focus: We continue to favor higher real rates that are supported by domestic fundamentals (BoP and
        inflation) and - in credit - curve trades and higher carry/beta sovereigns with an overall neutral stance.</p>
