    <p> Open bidding for natural gas with total volume of 4 mn cbm on September 12:This was according to the Shanghai
        Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange(SHPGX). PetroChina¡¯s Eastern Gas Sales Company was the vendor. The city
        gateprice in each province was the floor and price increases of up to 20% wereallowed during the bidding. More
        open bidding is likely to be arranged in thefuture (see report). We believe this bidding implies that 1)
        PetroChina is likely toenjoy a gas premium during the winter; 2) the city gate price cut of Rmb0.1/cbmhas
        already removed the tariff risk for PetroChina.<br/><br/>
        Bidding results are encouraging ¨C they confirm that end markets can affordhigher gas prices: All the gas
        contracts were sold at the maximum price, at a 20%premium to the city gate price in each province. Besides, the
        bidding wascompleted within 30 minutes of the start in the afternoon of September 12,implying that end demand is
        strong even with a 20% price premium. This furtherconfirms our view that the market-oriented gas price reform
        doesn¡¯t warrant agas price cut. It should be determined by China¡¯s natural gas cost curve andsupply-demand
        equilibrium. As a result, it is likely to increase from the currentlevel. (Gas Price Reform ¨C from
        Semi-Regulated to Fully Market-Oriented)LNG price rose 3% last week, to US$10.3/mmbtu: Overall, supply and
        demandremained largely stable last week. LNG prices increased in Shandong, and East,North, Northwest and
        Southwest China. They declined in Central China andremained stable in Northeast and South China.</p>
