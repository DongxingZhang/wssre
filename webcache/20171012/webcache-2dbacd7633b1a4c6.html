    <p> Conclusion: we conducted more channel checks. Nike¡¯s upcoming results mayreveal more innovation, which should be
        more important than the earningsitself for our ODM coverage.¡£<br/><br/>
        Nike¡¯s F1Q18(Jun, Jul and Aug) earnings due 9/27morning HKT¡£<br/><br/>
        Please kindly see below report by DB Nike analyst Paul Trussell (dated 2017Sep-13):<br/><br/>

        ODM faced pressure in calendar 2Q17¡­¡£<br/><br/>
        n Recall major US exporters (Feng Tay, Eclat¡­etc.) indicated continuedshipment delay and weak monthly sales
        growth during calendar 1H17.These likely point to a weak sporting goods retail environment in the USduring
        summer 2017.¡£<br/><br/>
        Legacy products (e.g. Feng Tay¡¯s Lebron James 14, Eclat¡¯s legacyleggings¡­etc.) likely faced pressure during the
        past summer.¡£<br/><br/>
        However, innovation will be a major driver for ODMs¡¯ calendar 2H17and 2018Earnings¡£<br/><br/>
        Our channel checks suggest a surge in demand for innovative products,this should boost ODMs¡¯ 2H17and
        2018growth.¡£<br/><br/>
        Lebron James 15: likely received very positive feedback from focus groupresearch. Thanks to its new upper
        (improved version of the first generationFlyknit) and the new cushion system.¡£<br/><br/>
        Vapor Max: saw significant order upward revision in the past two months,suggesting strong retail
        performance.¡£<br/><br/>
        New fabric: including Nike¡¯s new jacquard jacket collection for 17autumnas well as a series of leggings and
        sports bra.¡£<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks¡£<br/><br/>
        We value the sporting goods sector using DCF, as we expect investors tofocus on the sector¡¯s long-term value
        creation. For WACC, we follow DB¡¯sview on RFR and ERP while assigning a beta between 0.9to 1.3and terminalgrowth
        of 1-2%.¡£</p>
