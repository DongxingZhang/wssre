    <p> Korean telcos still face uncertainty over the timing and extent of tariff cuts. TheKorean telcos have decided
        not to challenge the government¡¯s decision to raise thetariff discount rate. As the tariff was already hurting
        growth at its prior level of 20%,the increase to 25% has further exacerbated the situation. Further, the
        government isexploring new measures to cut costs for low-income and elderly consumers. Thiscould take the form
        of a mandatory discount for elderly customers and a cKRW30k1GB data plan for low-income customers. Depending on
        the exact form of themeasures, 3-6m customers may be eligible for these discounts.<br/><br/>
        Expiry of the subsidy cap appears to be less of an issue. The Korean telcos havehad to abide by a KRW330k cap on
        per-handset subsidies since October 2015. Thisis set to expire at end-September, but we are less concerned about
        a return to theextremely high marketing spend and volatility that characterized the Korean telcomarket
        previously. This is because of other restrictions that remain in force ¨C thattelcos need to provide advance
        warning of tariff changes and implement themnationally reduces the scope, in our view, for the type of rapid
        increase in competitionthat was common before.<br/><br/>
        KT is our top pick. Regulatory pressure on the wireless sector has clearlyincreased. Alongside this is the
        pressure for the Korean telcos to invest early in 5G.<br/><br/>
        Our top pick among the Korean telcos is KT, which we see as having the mostdiversified business with clear
        growth prospects in areas separate to the current pricecontrols. These include IPTV, broadband and real estate.
