    <p> On 20 Sept 2017, Economics Information Daily (经济参考报) reported that fouradditional provinces, namely Jiangxi,
        Yunnan, Gansu and Shanxi, had included 36high-priced medicines into their provincial reimbursement drug list
        (RDL). Thesedrug names are the same as those shortlisted by the national government on 19July. Including these
        four provinces, it should now have over 19 provinces to addthese 36 drugs into their RDL.<br/><br/>
        The article highlighted that, as imported drugs can now be included into RDL at thebigger expense of selling
        prices, this makes the cheaper local-made medicines tobe less competitive in the market. In addition, the
        national government will try toimplement this bigger price cut mechanism on high-priced medicines in exchangefor
        their volume jump in most provinces. Coupled with good surveillance of drugcost spending, Chinese government
        aims to curb the over-usage of these highpriceddrugs, including monoclonal antibodies.<br/><br/>
        The same source also cited that, with the drug cost reimbursement amount fixedby the government post
        negotiation, it would be unlikely to see bigger selling pricefluctuations to hospitals for these high-priced
        medicines. Whereby these drugs areusually (1) to treat critical and rare diseases such as cancers; and (2) hard
        toproduce with good barriers of entry.<br/><br/>
        As we flagged in our 12 Sept 2017 note, we see these drugs with clinicalimportance would likely have their sales
        volume rebound (in particular to foreigndrugs), at the expense of their selling prices, similar to the case with
        GSK’sTenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (Viread?). Consistent with national governmentpolicy, it aims to provide
        Chinese masses accessible to cheaper quality medicinewith good efficacies. We expect this will increase the
        likelihood for many provincesto introduce further price cut on domestic drugs for critical illness, such as
        anticancerand stroke medicines.<br/><br/>
        Stock impact: This will dampen the sentiment of local drug-maker sector in theshort-term, despite of potential
        sales volume rebound for these import drugs fromsacrificing their selling prices. Same as we mentioned, we do
        not surprise to seefurther tough policy (such as price cut) on domestic high-priced drugs such aschemical drugs
        and monoclonal antibodies for anti-cancer therapy. Aside fromChina Medical System’s (867.HK, NR) XinHuoSu (新活素?;
        Nesiritide?), we see thismay also affect HK-listed CSPC (1093.HK, NR)’s future pricing on its Bortezomib
        forinjection (硼替佐米) as a first-to-market generic drug, which is currently on thathigh-priced drug list. Note
        that, CSPC has applied for production approval fromCFDA, likely to be on sales in the next 12 to 16 months.</p>
