    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average -4.6%. Weekly loadings up 1.6%.<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings decreased 4.6% in Week#39 (ended 09/23/2017) vs. a 4.2%
        decrease the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 0.3%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 1.6% YoY (versus a 0.8%
        decrease in the priorweek) and increased 0.7% sequentially (vs. a 5.0% increase in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices up 0.4 c/gal to 27.4 c/gal. Propane up 1.5 c/gal to 94.0 c/gal.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices were up 0.4 c/gal last week to 27.4 c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has
        declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16 start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston.
        Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/dfundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from
        thestart-up of 8 greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade
        toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue, with the premium reflecting fractionation,
        transportation and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17 US Natural Gas price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate
        ethane prices will move toward 30 c/gal by year-end ¡®17.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices rose 1.5 c/gal last week to 94.0 c/gal. While propaneinventories were down 3% last week to 78MM
        bbls, they are 16% and 8%below their 3 and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propaneinventories to
        decline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16 vs up 12% in ¡®15, upin ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene down 1.3 c/lb to 30.7 c/lb. Margins compress 2.2 c/lb to 12.6c/lb.<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 1.3 c/lb last week to 30.7 c/lb (vs the July contractprice of 29.25 c/lb,
        August/September contract prices remains unsetteled as a2 month settlement is being negotiated. Spot deals for
        September ranged from29.75 to 31.625 c/lb with deals for October delivery ranged between 29.75-31.75 c/lb.
        Average spot ethylene margins compressed 2.2 c/lb last week to12.6 c/lb on lower selling prices and higher
        production costs.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forSeptember delivery ranged between
        46.5-48.25 c/lb. September propylenecontract prices settled up 7 c/lb at 46.5 c/lb for PG and 45.0 c/lb for
        chemicalgrade on the back of Hurricane Harvery supply disruptions. Propylene prices,which had risen 21 c/lb, or
        68% (for PG), from December to March, fell 14 c/lb,or 27%, in April/May due to improving refinery-based supply.
        Prices rose 0.5c/lb in July and August.<br/><br/>
        10% of US ethylene capacity remain offline due to Hurricane Harvey.<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, approximately 10% of US ethylene capacity remains offline as a resultof Hurricane Harvey. IHS Nova
        Chemical¡¯s Sarnia, Ont cracker (2% of NorthAmerican {NA} ethylene capacity), Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#1) cracker (1.6%
        of NAethylene capacity), Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NA ethylene capacity)and Shell¡¯s Deer Park, TX
        cracker (3% of NA ethlylene capacity) will be offlinein September for planned turnaround work. For ¡¯17, IHS
        forecasts NA ethyleneproduction losses of 5.2B lbs, or 6.3%, of capacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs,or 5.5%, of
        capacity in ¡¯16 and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.</p>
