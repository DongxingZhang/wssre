    <p> Two central banks down, two to go. The cautious tone from the ECB wasdrowned out by the hawkish tone from the
        BoE. The Fed and the BoJ headlinethe coming week, with the tone from both likely to reflect the status quo,
        withone exception: we expect the Fed to announce balance sheet normalization.<br/><br/>
        G4 views: In the US, we suggest investors enter tactical UST 2s30s flatteners,given the risks of a lower
        dot-plot. We continue to find 2y swap spreadtighteners attractive in relative value terms, given their elevated
        level comparedto implied Libor-GC forward rates, and we suggest investors maintain a 2s5sswap spread curve
        steepener at -16bp. In the euro area, we outlined the ongoingEonia reform and we concluded that the Eonia review
        would not result in asignificantly lower fixing than the current rate in the near term. In Japan, weupdate on
        recent developments in the USDJPY basis and recommend to receive7y USDJPY basis outright at -59.5bp.<br/><br/>
        AUS and NZ: In Australia, strong data released last week caused the curve tosteepen to a level which we believe
        is unjustified, given economic fundamentals.<br/><br/>
        We argue that the 2s10s could start flattening should further future hikes bepriced in from here. Given the
        re-emergence of carry, we recommend buying AUD3m1y ATMF receiver vs. selling 2x AUD 3m1y ATMF-7bp receiver vs.
        buying AUD3m1y ATMF-14bp receiver for 1.4c (indicative mid). In New Zealand, we thinkcurrent rates pricing is
        too pessimistic and we see scope for FRA/OIS to widencoming out of the roll. We recommend receiving Feb-18 OIS
        vs. pay 1y1yIRS@61bp.</p>
