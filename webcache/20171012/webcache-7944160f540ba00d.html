    <p> Seoul reconstruction prices put end to four-week decline: Seoul reconstructionapartment prices stayed flat w-w
        last week, putting an end to a four-week decline thatbegan when new real estate measures were announced on Aug
        2. In one piece of positivenews, Seoul City last week approved an application for the reconstruction of
        JamsilJugong block 5 into high-rise apartments (up to 50 stories). Meanwhile, the media on Sep9 reported that
        the Financial Services Commission has postponed the unveiling ofcomprehensive household debt measures¡ªoriginally
        scheduled for mid-September¡ªuntilafter the Chuseok holidays in light of the need to monitor: 1)
        macroeconomicdevelopments amid North Korea¡¯s nuclear threats and the THAAD conflict; and 2) realestate market
        trends after the Aug 2 measures. As a result, the housing welfare roadmapis also likely to be postponed from
        late-September until after the Chuseok holidays. Withuncertainties likely to linger until the household debt
        measures and the housing welfareroadmap are out, the market should remain in wait-and-see mode.<br/><br/>
        Subscription market solid despite Aug 2 measures: Presales for GS Engineering&amp; Construction¡¯s Shinbanpo
        Central Xi¡ªthe first presales offered in an affluent district ofSeoul since the Aug 2 measures¡ªsaw a competition
        ratio of 168:1 (based on 16,472 firsttiersubscribers applying for 98 units), the highest in the Seoul
        metropolitan area (SMA)this year. Priced at KRW42.5m/3.3 m2, the apartments are over KRW10m/3.3 m2 cheaperthan
        neighboring apartments, which is attributable to the state-owned Housing &amp; UrbanGuarantee Corporation
        refusing to guarantee apartments that set presale prices higher inthat neighborhood. Thus, despite the Aug 2
        measures, there is still strong demand for newapartments in attractive locations with good access to public
        transport. Septemberpresales results for other major apartment complexes also warrant attention.<br/><br/>
        Unsold inventory down in July: Korea¡¯s unsold housing inventory fell 4.9% m-m toend July at 54,292 units. By
        region, unsold inventory declined 15.6% m-m in the SMA and1.4% m-m elsewhere. The sharp drop in the SMA was led
        by the Gyeonggi Province,where the number of unsold units slid below 10,000 for the first time in a decade.<br/><br/>
        Declines were particularly pronounced in Pyeongtaek, Osan, and Yongin. Meanwhile,completed unsold inventory
        decreased 1.8% m-m to 9,800 units.</p>
