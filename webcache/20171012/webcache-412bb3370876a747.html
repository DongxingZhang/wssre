        China¡¯s environmental crackdown is leading to inflated raw material costs forsteelmakers globally. Electrode
        prices have surged, adding $30-36/t toEuropean steelmakers¡¯ costs as Chinese exports are expected to halve in
        2017to 100kt, driven by enforcement of production stoppages to meetenvironmental standards. European steel mills
        consume 226kt of electrodesannually, with ~60% imported from China. Refractory prices have surged175%, as China
        has stopped issuing mining permits of magnesite, which is theprimary feedstock for steel furnace refractories.
        Additionally, electrodeshortage in China has indirectly impacted US mills who procure refractories, aselectrodes
        are also used in fused magnesia. (SBB)¡£<br/><br/>

        PC-24executive jets. First PC-24delivery isanticipated in 4Q17. While not a large volume client such as Boeing
        or Airbus,we view the increased aluminum plate volumes as a positive due to dilution offixed costs at company¡¯s
