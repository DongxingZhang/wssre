    <p> Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We use DCF, P/E-to-growth and relative P/E as the tools to value the sector.A DCF captures the future cash flow
        of consumer companies, while PE/G andrelative P/E show a company¡¯s relative value vs. peers. Downside risks:
        higherthan-expected raw material prices; SSSg failing to pick up; intensecompetition. Upside risks:
        greater-than-expected rise in overall SSSg or salesvolume; higher operating leverage; weaker-than-expected input
        costs.</p>
