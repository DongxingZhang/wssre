        Seaborne met coal price rises $7/t WoW to $210/t, driven by output cuts inChina¡¯s coal production hub of Shanxi.
        Output curbs were driven by a recentpush to increase safety inspections after 4mining accidents occurred
        inAugust. Expectations of new import restrictions added to supply concerns asthe southern port of Guangzhou has
        reached its yearly import quota andcannot import till next year. Demand from Chinese mills remained high as
        steeloutput continued at record levels. (SBB)¡£<br/><br/>

        India¡¯s Aditya Birla Group may be evaluating possible bids for Constelliumand/or Aleris Corp to increase its
        global aluminum operations. Aditya maypursue a deal through Novelis, a subsidiary of publicly-listed Hindalco,
        orthrough other means. Aleris¡¯ $2.3bn (~11x at time of deal; ~13x LTMEV/EBITDA) acquisition by Zhongwang is
        currently in limbo after nationalsecurityconcerns were raised by US officials. Applying the same Zhongwangdeal
        multiple (11x EV) would imply ~$22/sh for Constellium or $4.4bn EV.Novelis management¡¯s 1Q18conference call
        comments indicated a desire toreduce ND/EBITDA to ~3x vs ~4x as of June 30th raising doubt if deal would
        bethrough this non-listed entity. (Bloomberg Finance LP, DB)¡£</p>
