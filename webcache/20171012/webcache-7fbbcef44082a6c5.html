        Demand for high-grade iron ore increases as Chinese steel mills aim tomaximize productivity, increase efficiency
        and reduce emissions, amid anationwide environmental crackdown. Spread between high-grade and lowgradeore
        widened, with 65% content costing $100/t, twice as much as lowgrade58% content ($50/t). Prices of 58% content
        ore are 27% lower thanbenchmark 62% ore now (vs. 14% in 2012), indicating a market shift in China.This is
        favorable for Vale as it has recently revised 2017guidance to includemore high-grade ore and limit silica
        content to 5%. (Bloomberg Finance LP, DB)China¡¯s manufacturing PMI rises to 51.7in August (vs. 51.4in July,
