    <p> Two quarters of back-to-back sub-6% growth, a reflection of demonetization andGST-led "temporary disruption" in
        the economy, have raised worries regarding thelikely shape and speed of recovery in the coming quarters, even as
        stock marketscontinue to soar to new highs driven by a supportive flow dynamic. Indeed, thedivergence is quite
        stark.<br/><br/>
        Given the lack of considerable space both on the monetary and fiscal front tosupport growth, there is some
        merit, in our view, to consider non-traditionalways of freeing up resources for supporting growth. One
        possibility is to FXreserves for funding growth-critical public infrastructure projects. This idea hasbeen
        discussed in the past but not implemented due to concerns on inflation,fiscal and fear of sudden stops in
        capital flows. But currently the macro backdropis significantly different which could merit a favorable
        decision.<br/><br/>
        We show through different metrics (import cover, expanded version ofGreenspan-Guidotti rule, IMF composite
        metric) that India¡¯s reserves adequacystrength remains considerably stronger than what is prescribed and hence
        acase can be made in favour of using a small portion of these reserves for publicinvestment, which in turn would
        help to support growth. If USD15bn worth of FXreserves were channeled toward public investment in
        infrastructure, we estimatethis would reduce total reserves by only 3.5% but would add about 0.6% to
        GDP(INR960bn at the current exchange rate), which could help to support growth inthe near term. The reserves
        adequacy position hardly changes even if this transferwere to be made, and would remain significantly above the
        comfort range asprescribed by the IMF.</p>
