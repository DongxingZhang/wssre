    <p> We upgraded DARALA 19s to Buy from Hold last Friday on attractive riskreward @ Mid levels of USD99.1/546bps/7%
        (Click here). These Sukuks arecurrently trading above par and sub 500bps Mid Z spreads. Even at currentlevels,
        they look attractive relative to other regional HY real estate name ¨C foreg. vs. DAMAC 19s (BB rated). DAMAC
        reported 2Q17results yesterday whichcame in weaker than the lowest market estimates (per BBG). DAMAC¡¯srevenues
        declined 19.3% QoQ (-10.5% YoY), EBITDA declined ~18% QoQ andYoY while margin still remained healthy on a QoQ
        basis around ~47%..DAMAC¡¯s gross leverage increased as total debt more than doubled YoY,although it still
        remains significantly low on standalone basis and is fullycovered by cash balance which includes Escrow balance.
        FCF also turnednegative. Please see our Equity¡¯s colleague¡¯s note (Click here) for more details.<br/><br/>
        DALARA 19s vs. DAMAC 19s<br/><br/>
        DARAL 19s have significantly underperformed vs. DAMAC 19s YTD with theirZ-spread differential rising to 260bps
        compared to 100bps in the beginning ofthe year (see figure 1). We think DARAL 19s would be fairly priced around
        175-200bps over DAMAC19s considering former¡¯s higher leverage and two notchequivalent lower rating than the
        latter. Recall that DARALA¡¯s managementplans to use excess liquidity to buy back some of its existing
        2018Sukukswhich should help reduce their leverage and leave no meaningful debtrepayment before 2019Sukuks.</p>
