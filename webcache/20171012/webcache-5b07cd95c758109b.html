    <p> Singapore's industrial activity data is on fire. The tech cycle has handsomelybenefitted Singapore's
        manufacturing sector (c20% of GDP), in particular due to robustsemiconductor production. NODX is surging, too,
        and the leading indicator for servicesGDP turned positive after 7 quarters of contraction. Encouragingly,
        citizen unemploymentappears to have troughed after reaching a post-GFC high of 3.5% in 1Q17.<br/><br/>
        So why doesn't the MAS tighten now? We have argued that MAS' neutral policystance in play since April 2016 - and
        the forward guidance introduced in October 2016and reiterated in April 2017 - should not only be seen as
        counter-cyclical policy, but alsoas a reflection of economic restructuring, lower potential GDP, and the
        changing structureof the labour market. Crucially, we see scant evidence that core CPI will return to its
        longrunaverage until 2019, due in part to weak consumption, a reflection of Singapore's twospeedeconomy
        (although the property market recovery should change this in 2H18).<br/><br/>
        In short, the worst has passed for Singapore. But MAS is in no rush. We forecast areturn to a gradually positive
        slope in 1H2018. What about forward guidance? We think itwill likely be tweaked - whether by changing the
        wording or removing "extended period"altogether, but neither scenario would constrain the MAS next year.
        However, keeping thestatement unchanged would be a relatively dovish signal, suggesting that MAS is not atall
        swayed by the cyclical recovery, and remains focused on structural concerns for now.<br/><br/>
        FX strategy: We believe the SGD will outperform other low-yielding Asian FX,notably the THB and TWD. A more
        hawkish MAS would justify the SGD NEERtrading at current elevated levels, potentially rising to a fresh YTD high
        (providedUSD strength abates). Even if the "extended period" reference is kept, the knee-jerkdecline in the SGD
        NEER will likely be pared once market participants realise that theMAS could nevertheless restore a positive
        slope next April amid persistently positivedata surprises. There is even an outside chance the MAS may make an
        incrementalchange in the slope, although we note that historical exits from a neutral stance tendto slightly lag
        growth upturns but more closely track indicators on cost pass-through -some of which have not yet recovered to
        pre-neutral setting levels (see page 6).<br/><br/>
        Rates: Whether it is the removal of the forward guidance, or an even more hawkishimmediate shift to an
        upward-sloping NEER band at the coming meeting, Singapore¡¯sinterest rates should fall further below US interest
        rates, as investors associate theSingapore dollar with a greater appreciating bias (see page 8).</p>
