    <p> GST rate cuts or spending stimulus: If GST revenue collection persists ahead ofestimates, we expect either rate
        cuts, especially in mass consumption goods,and/or a lift in government spending. That said, the potential drag
        from joblosses in micro-enterprises, which could be suffering because of GSTimplementation, is still not behind
        us. We also keep an eye on real rates, whichcould nudge higher if aggregate price impulses remain weak (not our
        base case).<br/><br/>
        Income and balance sheet recession has ended: Earnings are heading back totheir previous peak and the return on
        capital is now equal to the cost of debtafter being below it for seven years. This will likely trigger greater
        capitalspending by corporates. It also means that from a portfolio perspective investorsshould focus on delta in
        return on capital rather than its level to pick stocks.<br/><br/>
        Earnings revisions breadth: The number remains negative implying that sell-sideestimates have been too high.
        This is also a reminder that what the sell-sideforecasts is not what the market prices in. That said, our macro
        indicators suggeststrong growth in the quarters ahead and therefore we think the breadth shouldturn
        positive.<br/><br/>
        The valuation issue: Mid-cap valuations look stretched. Additionally, stocks ofsome high-quality companies look
        rich too. Cyclically adjusted valuations (ShillerPE) are now nudging five-year highs, as is the market cap to
        GDP. Most othervaluation metrics look reasonable, though valuations on their own - unless atextreme points -
        rarely give a clue of where stocks are heading. We also don¡¯tthink the market is pricing in a multi-year growth
        cycle, implying meaningfulupside potential to stocks over the next 3-5 years.<br/><br/>
        Liquidity (or the bid): There is a structural shift underway on domestichousehold balance sheets (The Domestic
        Liquidity "DREAM" Run). M&amp;A; is likelyto remain strong. In the meanwhile, EM fund managers have trimmed
        their Indiapositions to four-year lows.<br/><br/>
        Pent-up equity supply: We expect a meaningful uptick in equity supply as morefirms either raise growth capital
        or balance sheet repair capital. This may absorbsome of the constant local demand for stocks.<br/><br/>
        The global bull market: Not for a moment should one disregard the fact that thebulk of the recent stock price
        performance in India is a reflection of a globalequity market. To us, that remains the key source of risk - both
        upside anddownside for our market call.</p>
