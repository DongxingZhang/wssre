    <p> Yesterday's pre-GST manufacturing GDP growth data (for the April-June quarter)was dragged down to a five year
        low, partly by GST related uncertainties. Today'spost-GST PMI Manufacturing print, showed some welcome rebound
        across theboard. Output, new orders and the order-to-inventory ratio ticked higher asuncertainties around the
        new tax regime abated. Corporate margins also improvedas output prices ticked higher while input price inflation
        slowed. And yet, each ofthese growth indicators remain below the pre-demonetization levels and futureconfidence
        has paled a tad. We see downside risks to our below consensusgrowth forecast of 7.1% for FY18.</p>
