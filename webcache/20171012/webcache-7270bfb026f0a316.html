    <p> Nationwide retail sales growth fell 0.3ppts MoM to 10.1% YoY in August, according to latest data fromthe
        National Bureau of Statistic (NBS), however, online sales growth accelerated, with accumulatedsales for the
        first eight months up 34% YoY. Alibaba is likely to increase spending on Tmall and newinitiatives for the
        following quarter. Adjusting for the Tmall expansion effort and the drag down fromconsolidation of Intime
        Retail, we lower our adjusted EPS forecasts from Rmb34.2 to Rmb32.9 inFY18E (+40% YoY), from Rmb46.9 to Rmb43.6
        in FY19E (+33% YoY), and from Rmb56.8 to Rmb53.8 inFY20E (+29% YoY). With growing online consumption and the
        firm¡¯s ¡°Super September¡± promotion,we revise up our target price from US$207 to US$218. With 23% upside, we
        maintain our BUY rating.<br/><br/>
        More efforts on Tmall. We see Alibaba has strengthened Tmall¡¯s importance in its strategic layout,and much of
        the spending this year may relate to activities and promotions for Tmall. We note strongTmall gross merchandise
        value (GMV) after the t.18 promotion. In order to maintain the trend, Alibabahas increased spending on sales and
        marketing and provided more subsidies to Tmall. We expect a1ppt uptick for sales and marketing expense
        (excluding share-based compensation expense) inFY2Q18 and a c.2ppt uptick for cost of revenue (excluding
        share-based compensation cost). Withsteady promotion, we expect Tmall market share to remain stable YoY at
        c.52-53% in FY17E.<br/><br/>
        Super September promotion. Alibaba will launch a ¡°Super September¡± promotion to drivebusiness-to-business sales
        from 20 September. The promotion focuses on providing a one-stopsolution for small- to medium-sized enterprise
        (SME) and incentivise overseas SMEs to order goodsfrom China. This first worldwide cross-border e-commerce
        solutions platform, providedfree-of-charge, helps buyers search, negotiate and complete transactions online,
        with secure logisticsprovided, will focus on consumer electronics, furniture, fashion and equipment categories.
        We see thisas a breakthrough in building trust among different parties from different nations, and are
        verypositive on the application of these solutions. While we may not see an immediate financial benefit,the
        value is in its unlocking of a massive overseas userbase for future.<br/><br/>
        Maintain BUY. For the next quarter, we expect a slowdown in revenue growth to Rmb52.2bn (+52%YoY) and lower
        margin due to the potential for more spending, resulting in adjusted EPS for 2QFY18Eof Rmb6.97 (+34% YoY). We
        lower our full-year operating margin forecast and thus our EPS forecasts,as adjusted for share-based
        compensation and the firm¡¯s substantial annual equity investments, fromRmb34.2 to Rmb32.9 in FY18E (+40% YoY),
        from Rmb46.9 to Rmb43.6 in FY19E (+33% YoY), and fromRmb56.8 to Rmb53.8 in FY20E (+29% YoY). We are positive on
        the ¡°Super September¡± promotion, thuswe revise up our target price from US$207 to US$218, representing 46x FY18E
        PE, 12x FY18E PB, 1.1xPEG, 35x EV/Ebitda, and 0.8x P/GMV. With 23% upside, we maintain our BUY recommendation.
