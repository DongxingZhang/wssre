        Gold price declines to 3-week low of $1,301/oz (-0.8% DoD) following US Fed¡¯slatest statement. Majority of Fed¡¯s
        policy setting committee deem another25bps interest rate hike in December as appropriate, despite recent
        dataindicating low inflation. Fed fund rate futures are now pricing in a 65% chanceof a rate hike (vs. 50% in
        last meeting). Also, the Fed plans to begin trimmingits balance sheet holdings at a monthly rate of $10bn, which
        it accumulatedfrom 2008onwards to offset financial crisis. (Reuters, Mining.com)</p>
