    <p> Final version similar to June draft with more leniency<br/><br/>
        On 28September, China's Ministry of Industries and Information Technology(MIIT), Ministry of Finance (MoF),
        Ministry of Commerce (MoC), GeneralAdministration of Customs (GAoC) and Administration of Quality
        Supervision,Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) issued the final ¡°Parallel AdministrativeMeasures for Passenger
        Vehicle (PV) Corporate Average Fuel Consumption(CAFC) and New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Credits¡±, which is also known
        as the CAFC+NEV dual-credit scheme, to be implemented in April 2018. In brief, besidesmeeting fuel efficiency
        credit requirements for sales fleets, the document alsorequires automakers to generate NEV credits equivalent to
        10% of sales by 2019and 12% by 2020, by selling a certain number of battery electric vehicles (BEV)and plug-in
        hybrid vehicles (PHEV). The NEV credit percentage requirement isapplicable to traditional PV OEMs with more than
        30k units of annual productionor import volume in China. Those which fail to earns enough credits from
        sellingNEVs/fuel-efficient cars, and fail to buy enough credits to compensate for theshortfall, would not be
        allowed to sell PV models that do not meet fuel efficiencyrequirements. We list some basic requirements for
        getting credits in Figure 1.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view - potential higher production costs in the long run<br/><br/>
        In 8M17, passenger NEV sales accounted for 1.8% of China¡¯s total vehicle sales.To obtain credits equal to
        10%/12% of PVs sold in 2019/2020, we estimate thatan OEM probably would need to achieve about 2.0-5.0%/2.5-6.0%
        NEV sales (asa percentage of PV sales volume), depending on the NEV mix and NEV advancedlevel. In our view,
        while it may not be an easy task for OEMs with a late start inNEV roll-out to achieve enough credits in 2019,
        the government does allow themto use credits gained in 2020to compensate. Therefore, we think that the
        credittrading market should not become active until 2020. In the meantime, we thinkOEMs will step up in R&amp;D;
        to hasten their NEV adoption rates and lower theirfleets' fuel consumption in China. If some fail to achieve
        that, they will eventuallyneed to purchase credits from those OEMs with spare credits for sale. In eithercase,
        auto production costs are going to be higher in China in the long run.<br/><br/>
        We use P/E to value auto OEMs. In terms of top Buys, we like BAIC Motor andBrilliance China, as we think that
        the premium auto segment growth will remainconsistent. We also rate GAC-H as a top Buy, as we observe strong
        sales andearnings trends in its various entities with popularity in its new SUV models.Sector upside/downside
        risks: sudden rise/drop in sales and inventory level.</p>
