    <p> A positive step in the long run but negative in the short term<br/><br/>
        Dr. Peng announced today that it would look to acquire 49% of Citic Networks¡¯ shares for RMB1.34bn. It came
        through after a failed attempt by Citic Telecom to acquire the asset due to concerns around foreign ownership.
        While the deal brings Dr. Peng closer to an integrated fixed broadband provider, restrictions remain around full
        private ownership of backhaul assets in China with no clear sight of when such rules could be relaxed. Without
        full operational control, the deal is likely to result in a near-term earnings drag for Dr. Peng and with its
        top-line growth remaining sluggish, we retain our SELL rating.<br/><br/>
        Limited impact on the major operators<br/><br/>
        Given Dr. Peng only has 14m fixed broadband subs, representing only 4% of the market, we see a limited
        competitive threat to the major operators even if Dr. Peng is able to improve its backhaul capabilities via the
        deal.<br/><br/>
        Citic Networks¡¯ losses continue<br/><br/>
        Citic Networks is the only backbone operator in China outside of the major telcos with 32,000km of fiber
        backhaul connecting the capital cities of almost all provinces in China. It reported a RMB104m loss after tax in
        FY16 with the trend continuing in 1H17. It was also loss making in FY14 and FY15.</p>
