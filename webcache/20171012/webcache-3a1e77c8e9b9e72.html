    <p> On the growth front, the synchronised global recovery continues. Growth continued to surprise on theupside in
        the likes of China, Japan and the eurozone in Q2, consensus forecasts for most regions ofthe world are still
        rising and the latest PMIs paint a picture of renewed acceleration. The majorpuzzles of dismal productivity
        growth and persistently weak wage growth, despite historically lowunemployment, continue. But with global
        financial conditions still loose, financial markets arebuoyant, particularly in EM where the lure of higher
        returns continues to suck large capital inflows intoFX, equities and bonds ¨C both domestic and foreign. More
        evidence that inflation is remainingundesirably low ¨C irrespective of the synchronised global growth and asset
        price gains ¨C is fuellingexpectations that the world¡¯s major central banks will keep erring on the side of
        caution.<br/><br/>
        For central banks which have spent much of the post-crisis period trying to avert deflation,synchronised growth
        provides welcome relief. But in many ways the challenges are about to getbigger. There is still huge uncertainty
        about the appropriate policy setting to deliver and maintainstable inflation. The other increasingly pressing
        challenge for central banks is that the balanceof risks between 1) meeting inflation targets in the medium term
        and 2) maintaining financial andmacroeconomic stability over the long term, may be starting to shift.<br/><br/>
        To assess the appropriate policy setting, central banks want to know where the economy isrelative to potential:
        whether demand is likely to grow more quickly than supply and push upinflation. But not just in the domestic
        economy. What is happening on the global stage is just asimportant. In developed economies growth in the capital
        stock is weak, productivity poor anddebt still high but not all on the supply side is bad. Technological
        progress and more flexiblelabour markets have allowed more workers to enter the labour market without pushing
        upinflation. Moreover, globally, the working-age labour force is still expanding, thanks to emergingeconomies¡¯
        growing populations.<br/><br/>
        Demand has also been accelerating, particularly in China, though the strongest acceleration iscoming through in
        the eurozone. Only time will tell how resilient global demand will remain asthe expansionary fiscal and monetary
        policy which led the upturn starts to fade.</p>
