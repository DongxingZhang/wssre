    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average -3.1%. Weekly loadings up 3.3%The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar
        loadings decreased 3.1% in Week#37(ended 09/09/2017) vs. a 2.9% decrease the prior week. Loadings YTD areup
        0.25%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges,
        and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof
        weekly loadings increased 3.3% YoY (versus a 21.3% decrease in the priorweek) and increased 16.1% sequentially

        Ethane prices down 1c/gal to 25c/gal. Propane up 4.5c/gal to 87.5c/galEthane prices were down 1c/gal last week
        to 25c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20c/gal). While US ethane supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane
        rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise
        Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston. Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/fundamentals to
        tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from thestart-up of 8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19.
        As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue,
        with the premium reflecting fractionation, transportation and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas
        price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate ethane prices will move toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.Propane prices
        rose 4.5c/gal last week to 87.5c/gal. While propaneinventories were up 3% last week to 82MM bbls, they are 12%
        and 3% belowtheir 3and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventoriesto decline due to
        higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).Spot ethylene up 0.8c/lb to 30.6c/lb. Margins down
        0.25c/lb to 14.5c/lbSpot ethylene prices rose 0.8c/lb last week to 30.6c/lb (vs the July contractprice of
        29.25c/lb, August contract price remains unsetteled). Spot deals forSeptember ranged from 29.875to 31.25c/lb
        with deals for October delivery at30.5-31.75c/lb. Average spot ethylene margins contracted 0.25c/lb last weekto
        14.5c/lb as higher production costs (propane and naphtha) more than offsethigher selling prices.¡£<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forSeptember delivery at 45c/lb.
        August propylene contract prices settled up 0.5c/lb at 39.5c/lb for PG and 38.0c/lb for chemical grade.
        Propylene prices,which had risen 21c/lb, or 68% (for PG), from December to March, fell 14c/lb,or 27%, in
        April/May due to improving refinery-based supply. After rolling overflat in June and a 0.5c/lb increase in July,
        August contracts settled higherdriven by lower-than-expected supply levels due to the delayed start-up
        ofEnterprise¡¯s PDH unit.¡£<br/><br/>
        15% of US ethylene capacity offline due to Hurricane Harvey¡£<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, approximately 15% of US ethylene capacity remains offline as a resultof Hurricane Harvey, with unit
        start-ups continuing as the market recovers. IHSNova Chemical¡¯s Sarnia, Ont cracker (2% of North American {NA}
        ethylenecapacity) and Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NA ethylene capacity) will beoffline in September under
        planned turnaround work. For ¡¯17, IHS forecasts NAethylene production losses of 3.5B lbs, or 4.1%, of capacity.
        This compares to4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacityin ¡¯15.¡£</p>
