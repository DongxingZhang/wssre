    <p> Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We value the sporting goods sector using DCF, as we expect investors tofocus on the sector¡¯s long-term value
        creation. For WACC, we follow DB¡¯sview on RFR and ERP while assigning a beta between 0.9to 1.3and terminalgrowth
        of 1-2%. Downside risks: weaker cyclical recovery, weaker innovationthat fails to drive new demand, sports
        segmentation and e-commerce¡¯sinability to drive sector growth.</p>
