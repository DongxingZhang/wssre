    <p> We believe the airlines and container shipping sectors are likely to offer sector-wideinvestment opportunities
        in 2018. In particular, airlines is likely to achieve a substantialincrease in profitability, while container
        shipping should have excess capacity cleared outand be ready for a rebound in 2019. Meanwhile, we believe that
        undervalued stocks withhigh dividend yields and subsector leaders will maintain share price strength.<br/><br/>
        Airlines: Sector upcycle driven by improving earnings amid contracting supplyCyclical movements in the airlines
        sector have typically been driven by the supplydemandcycle. The CAAC is focusing on flight punctuality rates in
        its current regulatoryefforts, and has for the first time introduced stringent control of airport time slots,
        puttinga strong constraint on sector supply. In addition, we have observed a slowdown in aircraftpurchases by
        airline companies in 2018. We expect the airline industry to overcome itsprevious failure to enhance profits
        despite rising business volume and see increases inboth airfares and the PLF.<br/><br/>
        The CAAC has also continued to relax its control over airfare pricing policies. Most of theflights currently
        subject to market-adjusted prices are regional, short-distance flights witha distance within 800km, while most
        first- and second-tier flights are still followinggovernment guidance prices. With the promotion of
        marketization reform, first- andsecond-tier flights will also gradually shift towards market-adjusted pricing,
        which shouldbring substantial improvement to earnings. We suggest watching China Southern Airlines(600029 CH)
        and Air China (601111 CH)Container shipping: Sector supply-demand to improve as overcapacity continuesto be
        removed The container shipping sector is bottoming out, though the sector is stillundergoing a reduction of
        excess capacity which has constrained the momentum offreight rate growth. A large amount of outdated capacity
        was removed through shipdisassembly in 2016. Despite lacklustre freight rates in the peak season in 2017, the
        idlerates of container ships decreased to a normal level. In 2018 and 2019, we believecontainer shipping supply
        growth will remain at a relatively low level, and that freight ratesare very likely to increase steadily as the
        sector supply-demand balance improves. Risingindustry concentration should further strengthen upward momentum of
        freight rates. Wehighlight China COSCO (601919 CH).<br/><br/>
        Airports: Prefer stocks likely to benefit from visibility-driven premium as LTinvestment logic refocuses on
        organic growth As most factors driving the airportsector have been priced in, we believe the sector investment
        horizon will be extendedgoing forward, and that investors will refocus on organic business volume growth
        wheninvesting in the sector. We suggest selecting stocks: 1) with substantial room for capacityexpansion, and 2)
        which are unlikely to make large-scale capex that is not in line with theirflight structure. We suggest watching
        Shanghai International Airport (600009 CH).<br/><br/>
        Toll roads &amp; rail transport: Earnings remains key for stock selection; reformexpectations also worth
        watching For the toll road sector, stocks with high dividendyields are still our top picks. That said, given
        upcoming expiries of toll collection rights, wealso suggest watching companies experiencing business
        transformation and growthcompanies with longer-lasting toll collection rights. For rail transport, Daqin
        Railway(601006 CH) is our favorite as it is a typical undervalued sector leader with high dividendpayouts.
        Meanwhile, Guangshen Railway (601333 CH) is certain to raise prices thoughits timetable for price hikes is
        uncertain.</p>
