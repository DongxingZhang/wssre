        As we mentioned in our report titled Shanghai Jahwa - Jahwa parent co. to buy20% stake of Jahwa listco at
        RMB38per share published on 13Oct 2017, webelieve the offer price (RMB38/share) is more attractive with a larger
        premiumvs the average price of the previous three/six months and the last tender offerin 2015. For now, Shanghai
        Jahwa Group has increased its share of the Jahwalistco from 27.09% to 47.09%. Ping An has also increased its
        shareholding from32.02% to 52.02% and has become a controlling shareholder of the company. Aswe mentioned
        earlier, we believe its share price will normalize after the exercise.We maintain our Hold recommendation on
        Jahwa.</p>
