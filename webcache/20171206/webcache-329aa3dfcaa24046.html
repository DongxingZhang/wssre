    <p> GF Securities is the largest non-state-owned broker in China, ranking fourth in terms of total assets,sixth in
        terms of net assets, and fourth in terms of net capital as of end-June 2017. We are positive onthe long-term
        profitability and competitiveness of the firm¡¯s investment banking, asset management,and internet finance
        segments, despite declining commission rates in the traditional brokeragebusiness. We forecast EPS of Rmb1.12 in
        17E (+6.7% YoY), Rmb1.31 in 18E (+17.0% YoY), andRmb1.61 in 19E (+22.9% YoY). With 14.7% upside to our target
        price of HK$18.30, we initiatecoverage of the company with an Outperform rating.<br/><br/>
        Strong IPO pipeline. GF Securities¡¯ investment banking arm focuses on small and medium-sizedenterprises (SMEs).
        The firm underwrote Rmb14.0bn in A-share initial public offerings (IPOs) in9M17, representing an 8.0% market
        share. Since the opening of the SME Board in 2004 and ChiNextBoard in 2009, GF has sponsored 61 companies on the
        SME Board and 47 companies on the ChiNextBoard. It ranks third in terms of IPOs sponsored year to date, with 129
        companies in its current IPOpipeline. We expect investment banking revenue to grow at a Cagr of 15.9% in
        2016-19E andaccount for 9.1% of total revenue by 19E (vs 7.8% in 16A).<br/><br/>
        Comprehensive asset management services. GF¡¯s asset management business boasted Rmb1.4tn ofassets under
        management (AUM) as of end-1H17. Meanwhile, its 51.1%-owned GF Fund and 25%-owned E Fund Management represented
        a combined AUM of Rmb736.0bn. Moreover, the firm ranksfirst among Chinese peers in terms of AUM for collective
        asset management (CAM) schemes, andfirst among Hong Kong-listed Chinese brokers in terms of AUM for in-house
        managed products. Inaddition, GF is the first domestic broker to have secured a qualified domestic limited
        partnership(QDLP) licence and one of the first to have set up an asset management division overseas,underscoring
        its resolve to expand globally. We expect GF Asset Management¡¯s revenue to grow at aCagr of 13.0% and GF Fund¡¯s
        revenue to expand at a Cagr of 8.2% in 2016-19E.<br/><br/>
        Declining commission rates partly offset by market share gain. Despite expanding its brokeragemarket share from
        4.06% in 2013 to 4.31% in 1H17, GF Securities¡¯ average commission ratedropped from 8.9bps in 2013 to 4.1bps in
        1H17, in line with the industry trend, due to increasingcompetition from online brokerages and a policy change
        allowing investors to open more than onebrokerage account. As a result, we expect the firm¡¯s total brokerage
        revenue to decrease at a Cagr of-10.6% in 2016-19E. Nonetheless, we forecast revenue generated by its margin
        financing and stocklending business, launched in March 2010, will grow at a Cagr of 6.4% over the same
        period.<br/><br/>
        Mobile and internet finance. GF has developed a mobile application and web-based services tomeet the needs of
        internet customers, especially in the wealth management segment, amid China¡¯srapidly expanding internet finance
        sector. In end-1H17, the number of mobile-phone securitiescustomers exceeded 12m (+125% YoY), becoming an
        important account opening channel for thefirm.<br/><br/>
        Initiate with an Outperform. We forecast EPS of Rmb1.12 in 17E (+6.7% YoY), Rmb1.31 in18E (+17.0% YoY), and
        Rmb1.61 in 19E (+22.9% YoY). GF is currently trading at 1.12x 18E PB,vs a sector average of 1.06x 18E PB, but
        below its historical average of 1.40x PB. We derive atarget price of HK$18.30 (1.34x 18E PB). With 14.7% upside,
