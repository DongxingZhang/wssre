    <p> Last week¡¯s (Wed-Wed) review of funds¡¯ in/outflows as % of funds¡¯ AuM.<br/><br/>
        US equity funds gained inflows for the third week in a row, marking a modest yetlongest streak since Q1 2017,
        and pushing the cumulative flows for this year intopositive territory again. The US were the main contributor to
        a 19-week high intakefor DM equity funds, with European mandates only adding at the margin (as UKand Spain
        continued dragging) while Japan funds suffered (on top of what hadbeen three-year high outflows ahead of the
        election). And with US GDP growthfor Q3 coming in above expectations, US macro surprises picked up once
        more,suggesting US equity inflows to continue in the coming weeks (Fig. 1). EM equityfunds, on the other hand,
        saw 10-week high outflows and only the fourth week ofoutflows year-to-date. The ECB¡¯s impending QE decision last
        Thursday (outside ofour data set) along with a stronger USD prompted outflows from EM equity funds,yet hard
        currency flows helped EM bond funds to gain even as local currencyfunds posted first consecutive outflows for
        this year. The recent rally in EM fundscan partly be attributed to a strong showing for EMEA &amp; LatAm,
        supported bythe 20% rise in the oil price over the past quarter (Fig. 2). But with Brent havingpushed through
        $60/bbl for the first time since Jul'15, our commodity analystsees downside risk for oil in the near-term,
        which, paired with our FX strategists'tactical upside to the USD, points to headwinds for EM flows into
        year-end.</p>
