    <p> New mutual fund applications for Southbound-loaded funds delayed<br/><br/>
        SCMP has reported that the CSRC will delay approvals of new domestic mutualfunds investing over 80% of assets in
        Hong Kong via Stock Connect. The source /breakdown of Southbound flows has been a puzzle for investors: in this
        report, wecreate a proxy universe of Southbound mutual funds by summarizing data across92different
        Southbound-focused mutual funds. Total mutual fund AUM of ouruniverse equates to 10% of total SB holdings. We
        find that 80% of AUM is fromthe top 20funds, with only 3of those funds launched in 2017. Our universe showsa
        relative balanced asset allocation, with 50% of AUM in Hong Kong stocks, 44%in A-shares and 6% in domestic
        bonds.<br/><br/>
        Negative for sentiment... but where will all the money go?<br/><br/>
        While likely negative for sentiment, we think the Southbound story will continueto have a significant impact at
        the single stock level: stocks remain an attractiveasset class for domestic investors, as measures impact the
        appeal of physicalproperty, restrictions are increasing on WMP's and limited avenues remainfor forex exposure.
        Amongst stocks, HK-listed names command a significantvaluation discount and provide diversification and FX
        exposure.</p>
