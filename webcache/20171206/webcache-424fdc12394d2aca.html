    <p> India's real GDP grew by 6.3%yoy in July-Sep¡¯17, broadly in line with theBloomberg consensus estimate (6.4%).
        However, GVA growth in real terms wasslightly weaker at 6.1%yoy, but higher than the 5.6% outturn of the
        previousquarter. On the GVA front, industrial sector growth improved (6.9% vs. 1.5%),while agricultural (1.7%
        vs. 2.3%) and services sector (6.6% vs. 7.8%) growthmoderated from the previous quarter. The moderation in
        ¡°public administration,defence and other services¡± (6.0%yoy vs. 9.5%yoy) component (which reflectsgovernment
        fiscal spending) was particularly responsible for driving servicessector growth lower in July-Sep¡¯17, in line
        with our expectations though other keyservices sector components also contributed to the slowdown. However, we
        notethat non-farm sector growth improved in July-Sep¡¯17 to 6.6%, from 6.1% in theprevious quarter due to the
        rebound in industrial sector growth. GVA excluding"public administration, defence and other services" also
        improved in July-Sep¡¯17to 6.1% from 5.0% in the previous quarter, as also GVA excluding agriculture and"public
        administration, defence and other services" (6.8% vs. 5.5%).<br/><br/>
        The expenditure side GDP data, which is volatile and less reliable, showed thatoverall consumption growth has
        slowed down further in July-Sep'17. While themoderation in private consumption growth was modest (6.5%yoy in
        July-Sep¡¯17,from 6.7%yoy in April-June¡¯17), the slowdown in government consumptiongrowth (4.1%yoy vs. 17.2%yoy)
        was striking. This is, however, not surprising, asthe monthly fiscal data had already indicated a sharp slowdown
        of governmentconsumption growth during the July-Sep quarter. In order to meet the fiscaldeficit target, the
        government had started to compress spending from theJuly-Sep quarter, which has led to a loss of momentum in
        government finalconsumption expenditure. Net exports also subtracted 1.3% from growth (versus-2.6% in the
        previous quarter), with imports (7.5%yoy) continuing to outpaceexports (1.2%yoy) growth in July-Sep¡¯17. On the
        positive side, gross fixed capitalformation growth improved further to 4.7%yoy in July-Sep¡¯17, versus 1.6%yoy
        inthe previous quarter.<br/><br/>
        The July-Sep GDP growth outturn, which was broadly in line with marketexpectations indicate that the economy has
        started to stabilize since the thirdquarter, albeit at a modest pace. We expect the sequential recovery in
        growthto continue, with the momentum improving further in 2HFY18, as the base effectturns positive and pent-up
        demand starts reflecting in higher private consumptiongrowth (56% of GDP). While we expect growth to average
        around 6.6% duringFY18, we are more optimistic about the outlook for FY19 and beyond.</p>
