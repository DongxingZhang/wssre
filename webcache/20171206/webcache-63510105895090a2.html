    <p> The Trump administration announced the nomination of Marvin Goodfriend tothe Board of Governors yesterday
        evening. If approved, he would fill one ofthree currently vacant seats on the Board. Goodfriend is a respected
        monetaryeconomist with considerable experience and expertise both inside and outside theFederal Reserve system.
        He served senior roles at the Richmond Fed, includingas the director of research and policy advisor in the 1990s
        and early 2000s,prior to joining Carnegie Mellon as a professor of economics. He also hasprevious experience in
        Washington, having served on Ronald Reagan¡¯s Council ofEconomic Advisers. Goodfriend is well qualified for a
        Governor position, and hisappointment will add much needed expertise on macroeconomics and monetarypolicymaking
        to a Board that has already lost one heavyweight in this area inStanley Fischer and will lose another when Janet
        Yellen retires once Powell issworn in as chair.<br/><br/>
        Below we highlight five takeaways on what Goodfriend could mean for the Fed.<br/><br/>
        Leans hawkish but is not a strident hawk<br/><br/>
        Throughout his papers and interviews, it is clear that Goodfriend views Fedcredibility in achieving its
        objectives ¡ª especially its inflation target ¡ª aspreeminent. In the current context, with inflation below target
        and some evidencethat inflation expectations have slipped, it could be argued that Goodfriend¡¯sviews about Fed
        credibility would put him in a dovish camp.<br/><br/>
        However, we would caution against this interpretation for several reasons. First,Goodfriend holds generally
        mainstream views on macroeconomics, and is likelyto believe, as the center of the FOMC currently does, in the
        validity of the Phillipscurve. Second, it is clear throughout his writings that he is more concerned aboutthe
        Fed not defending its inflation target from the upside, i.e., that the Fed risksfalling behind the curve,
        allowing inflation to rise above target and raising thespecter of unanchored inflation expectations and a loss
        in Fed credibility thatcomes with it. This view is evident in comments he made in a Congressionalhearing earlier
        this year in which he stated that, "The Fed's history of falling behindthe curve on inflation is cause for
        concern."1Though these comments were madeat a time when core inflation was well above current levels, we expect
        that hewill still hold this view given recent tentative evidence of stronger inflation. Third,</p>
