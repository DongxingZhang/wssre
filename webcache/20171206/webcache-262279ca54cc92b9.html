    <p> The US Senate is expected to vote on its tax reform bill this week, as early as Thursday (November 30th), two
        weeks after the House passed its vote. Unlike the House vote, which was largely non-event, the Senate vote
        attracts more attention, as the Republicans only hold a two-seat slim majority in the Senate and there are still
        notable concerns among Republican senators on the tax bill. If the Senate fails to pass the bill, it will
        probably mean the end of the tax overhaul at least before the midterm elections next November. Such a result
        would significantly damage the Republican Party¡¯s chances of continuously holding majorities in both chambers
        after the midterm, and even the odds of Trump¡¯s re-election in 2020.<br/><br/>
        The Senate finalized its own tax bill last week, and as we have stated in previous reports, the Senate bill has
        its own key features that differ from the House bill in many ways. The key features of the Senate tax bill
        included: 1) individual tax overhaul will expire after 2025, 2) the corporate tax cut will be permanent but only
        starting from 2019, 3) permanently repeal the ¡°individual mandate¡± in Obama¡¯s Affordable Care Act (ACA). The
        individual mandate requires most individuals and families to have a certain minimal amount of health insurance;
        otherwise, they have to pay a fine, called the individual shared responsibility payment, which is one of the ACA
        tax provisions.<br/><br/>
        Given this much more narrow 52-48 edge for the Republicans in the Senate, the Republicans still cannot afford
        more than 2 dissenters within the party for this week¡¯s vote. However, currently, there are already more than
        two Senate Republicans who have expressed oppositions / concerns / reservations towards the Senate bill.
        Internal fissures are mainly focusing on three areas: 1) the repeal of ACA¡¯s individual mandate could lead to
        about 13 million people losing their healthcare coverage in the next 10 years, and would possibly cause a
        significant increase in average health insurance premiums; 2) pass-through entities still face higher taxes
        compared to large corporates, and better treatments for small businesses should be implemented; 3) fiscal hawks
        still have notable concerns on the rising budget deficit caused by tax cuts. Although such concerns are already
        addressed in the Senate bill by adding a sunset clause on individual tax cut that will expire after 2025, some
        Senate Republicans are still worried about the possibility of temporary tax cuts being extended.<br/><br/>
        However, our baseline case is that the Senate will manage to pass its tax bill this week. 1) Unlike the
        healthcare reform earlier this year (which lacked a detailed and well-structured alternative plan), the tax
        reform bills are better prepared with more comprehensive and feasible contents that have gained more support
        within the Republican Party: the House voted 227-205 to pass its tax bill, which was more favorable than the
        House vote on healthcare reform (217-213) in May; 2) although there are notable concerns on the potential
        inequality of the benefit distribution arising from the tax cut, the tax cuts will still broadly lower tax costs
        for most individuals and corporates; 3) it is almost a ¡°must-win-battle¡± for Trump and the Republican Party:
        with none of his election promises turning into reality, the tax reform could be Trump' last hope before the
        coming midterm elections in November 2018. If the tax reform, again, fails, it could significantly impact the
        Republican Party¡¯s chances of continuously holding majorities in both chambers, and even Trump¡¯s re-election in
        2020.<br/><br/>
        Finally, even the Senate bill is eventually passed, the reconciliation process could be contentious, given the
        significant differences between the two bills. Thus, it is challenging for Trump to intend to finalize the tax
        reform before Christmas, and in our view, it could be delayed until 1Q 2018. For the final version of the tax
        bill, we see it more likely to be closer to the Senate bill. 1) The Senate bill is less aggressive and, to some
        extent, trying to scale back the rising budget deficit. 2) The two chambers still need to vote on the result of
        the reconciliation; given the slim majority in the Senate, the House may need to make some compromise to the
        Senate.</p>
