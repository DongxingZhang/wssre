    <p> Developers with premium land banks in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area tobenefit from ongoing property
        price appreciation Property prices have been on the rise inmajor cities in Guangdong related to the Bay Area
        initiative. Given the outlook for economicgrowth and the expected inflow of capital and talent, we believe
        developers with sizable landbanks in the area will benefit most from property price appreciation. We expect
        residentialproperty prices in the region to double over the next 5-8 years.<br/><br/>
        Most developers are trading at the mid to upper end of their 2014-17 P/B ranges GivenChina developers¡¯ improving
        gross margins and earnings growth visibility, most developers¡¯are trading at the mid to upper end of their
        2014-17 P/B ranges. With decelerating contractsales ahead in 2018, we see current valuations as relatively
        expensive, and suggest focusingon stock picking.<br/><br/>
        We prefer developers likely to exceed sales and earnings consensus Given a lack ofsector-wide share price
        catalysts, we prefer developers that are likely to exceed consensusexpectations for sales and earnings in 2018.
        We also like land-owners in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area.<br/><br/>
        Yuexiu Property (123 HK, Buy) The company is a major Guangzhou-based state-ownedresidential developer that has a
        premium land bank of 7.7m sqm GFA in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area. The stock is trading at 0.5x 2017E
        NBV, which we believe doesnot factor in the solid land price appreciation potential in the Bay Area. We maintain
        our Buyrating and target price of HK$2.60, equal to 1.0x 2017E NBV.<br/><br/>
        Gemdale P&amp;I; (535 HK, Buy) The company¡¯s 10M17 contract sales revenue increased 1.3xYoY to Rmb36.4bn, and
        GFA sold rose 1.2x YoY to 2.0m sqm. We forecast earnings will growat a CAGR of at least 50% in 2018-19, whereas
        management expects revenue and earningsto double in 2018. We maintain our Buy rating and target price of
        HK$1.60, equal to 10x2017E P/E.</p>
