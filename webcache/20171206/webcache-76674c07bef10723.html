    <p> Investor day to highlight latent capacity across copper, met coal, iron ore<br/><br/>
        BHP¡¯s investor day and visit to the Olympic Dam (OD) copper/uranium/goldmine on 28-29November will include an
        update on the copper market, theplanned expansion of OD, and Pilbara and Bowen Basin creep projects. In
        thisreport we outline our analysis of the OD expansion. We like the high returning280/330project but not the low
        returning 450/550heap leach. We remainbullish on BHP due to; the focus on returns, strong FCF (US$8b post
        capex),compelling latent capacity and cost out, sale of non-core assets (US Onshore,possibly thermal coal, small
        copper and met), potential US$3-4b share buybackwith the FY18results, and attractive valuation (A$29.56/sh, 6x
        EBITDA).<br/><br/>
        Yes to the 280/330expansion, no to the heap leach<br/><br/>
        OD is an important part of BHP¡¯s group wide latent capacity projects. BHP iscurrently studying an expansion from
        220kt to 280ktpa (known as BFX280) andthen to 330ktpa by FY24, with an expansion of the UG and
        surfaceinfrastructure (smelter, refinery etc), and a larger expansion to 450/550ktpa byFY27through the
        development of a heap leach. We already include theUS$1.5b BFX280expansion in our BHP model as it is high
        returning (c. 25%IRR) and lower risk. We value BFX280at US$2.6b. We do not include the heapleach as it is low
        returning (&lt;15% IRR), high risk, in our view (doubling of theUG to 21Mtpa, high working cap build-up), and
        capex could be US$5b on ourestimates. The main questions we have for the site visit are: 1. Management¡¯sability
        to turnaround an underperforming asset? 2. Capex estimates for all theexpansions? 3. Operating costs of the
        proposed heap leach? 4. Powerreliability from supplier ElectraNet and supply for the expansion? 5. Impact onthe
        already struggling uranium market (heap leach would add 15Mlb into a c.190Mlb market), 6. How does 21Mtpa x 2%
        Cu x 95% recovery = 450ktpa?<br/><br/>
        Olympic Dam an important part of BHP¡¯s copper growth<br/><br/>
        OD has been the perennial underperformer in BHP¡¯s copper portfolioexceeding 200ktpa nameplate only twice in the
        past decade. However the 10btcopper resource remains an important part of BHP¡¯s copper portfolio. Wevalue OD at
        US$4.5b which includes US$2.6b for the expansion to 280ktpa.OD represents 15% of our BHP copper NPV and 4% of
        our BHP valuation. BHPhas 6major copper expansion projects. Of these, we only include SpenceHypogene and the OD
        BFX280expansion. See Figure 5for the other projects.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Our PT is set broadly in line with our revised DCF NPV of A$29.56/sh using anominal WACC of 9%. Key risks
        include lower commodity prices (see p10).</p>
