    <p> Auto We think the gradual withdrawal of NEV subsidies has been anticipated by thesector, as it is in line with
        the government's intention to make sector development moremarket-oriented. We continue to recommend Geely Auto
        (175 HK) and Brilliance China(1114 HK). Total BMW sales in China picked up 14.2% YoY to 50412 units in Oct.
        Thenew 5 series is still going through a ramp-up in China. We suggest watching Yongda Auto(3669 HK) and
        Zhengtong Auto (1728 HK) given the large proportion of BMW models intheir car sales mix.<br/><br/>
        Tourism Haichang Ocean Park (2255 HK) recorded revenue growth of nearly 20% duringthis year¡¯s National
        Day/Mid-Autumn Day holiday week, and Shanghai Haichang OceanPark is expected to open in Aug 2018.<br/><br/>
        Education Given a structural supply shortage of K12 education resources in China, wehighlight TAL Education (TAL
        US), New Oriental Education (EDU US) and WisdomEducation (6068 HK).<br/><br/>
        Juvenile products The two-child policy should boost demand in the juvenile productindustry. The acquisition of
        the branded non-durable maternity, baby and children (MBC)product businesses from Goodbaby China has increased
        Goodbaby International¡¯s (1086HK) exposure to the fast-growing China market.<br/><br/>
        Home appliance Ongoing consumption upgrade and rising industry concentration willbenefit leading white goods
        manufacturers. During this year¡¯s Singles¡¯ Day onlineshopping spree, Haier posted strong sales performance in
        the home appliance category.<br/><br/>
        We continue to like Haier Electronics (1169 HK).<br/><br/>
        Key risks include an economic downturn, the different investment styles in the A-shareand HK markets, and
        volatility in the Rmb/HK$ exchange rate.</p>
