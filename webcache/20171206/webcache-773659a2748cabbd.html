    <p> Last Friday, the HKSFC released the aggregate short positions data for November 17. Weanalysed which companies
        may be vulnerable to short-selling activity, based on the followingthree criteria: (i) the net change in short
        positions between November 10 and November17; (ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the
        absolute amount of shortpositions. We must emphasize this is only an objective quantitative analysis based
        onofficial data; the analysis does NOT imply that we feel uncomfortable with the corporategovernance or
        fundamentals of some companies. According to the results of ouranalysis, we believe Q Tech (1478.HK), Genescript
        (1548.HK) and CMOC (3993.HK) requireclose monitoring, based on their latest short positions outstanding. On the
        other hand,we note that short positions in BAIC Motor (1958.HK) and China Coal (1898.HK) havedropped
        significantly.<br/><br/>
        Short positions in Q Tech, Genescript and CMOC increased significantly. As Figure 2shows, short positions in Q
        Tech rose 66.6% during the week ended November 17. Theoutstanding short positions were equivalent to 3.8% of the
        free float. Figure 2 also showsthat short positions in Genescript rose 29% within the week. We highlighted this
        stock lastweek, and short positions in the stock have continued to increase. Outstanding short positionshave
        reached 4.8% of the free float. We reiterate our view that Investors should payattention to any potential
        profit-taking activity, as the stock has surged about 120% in threemonths. Meanwhile, short positions in CMOC
        increased 24.5% during the week ended November17, with the outstanding positions equivalent to 6.5% of its free
        float. Its stock pricehas lost momentum since late October after a rally of about 100% in four months. Short
        positionsin CPIC (2601.HK) jumped 13.3x within the week, but this is more likely related tosome derivative
        activities, based on our understanding.<br/><br/>
        Significant decline in short positions in BAIC Motor and China Coal. Outstanding shortpositions in BAIC Motor
        dropped 14% during the week ended November 17 (Figure 3). Theshare price was up 5.5% last week. Outstanding
        short positions in China Coal also fell10.9% during the week ended November 17. Following a correction since
        early Octoberbecause of weakening coal prices, we saw its share price rebound 4.3% last week. We don¡¯trule out
        the possibility that some investors may begin trimming their short positions. As theoutstanding short positions
        are equivalent to 9.9x of the 3-month average daily turnover, itmay continue to offer some support to the share
        price if more investors close their shortpositions.<br/><br/>
        Recap: Source of data. The HKSFC releases the aggregate short positions in all eligiblestocks every Friday with
        a delay of one week. The HKEx releases the data on short-sellingactivity on a daily basis (without a one-week
        delay), but investors do not know whether theshort positions are covered or not later. Therefore, the usefulness
        of the HKSFC data is thatit provides the outstanding short positions in each stock, and investors can trace the
        netchange on a weekly basis. However, there are still some limitations, as this data set cannotcover
        short-selling activity using OTC derivative products.<br/><br/>
        Three angles to analyzing the data. (i) The net change in short positions between November10 and November 17;
        (ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the absoluteamount of the short positions.</p>
