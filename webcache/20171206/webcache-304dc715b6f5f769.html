    <p> Sector risk manageable... CU our top pick on stronger momentum<br/><br/>
        The Chinese telcos have delivered solid top-line growth this year (6%) but havebeen casualties of risk-on trade.
        While competitive intensity increasedfollowing the launch of CT¡¯s RMB99/mth unlimited data plans in September,we
        do not believe the sector will engage in cut throat competition at this stage,in view of its orderly behavior to
        date. M&amp;A; risk also recently came to the fore,with CT looking to acquire a near bankrupt Oi, although if
        this goes through, itwould most likely occur at the parent level. While we still like CM, whose nextlikely major
        catalyst is in 1H18, we change our top pick to CU, where revenuemomentum is improving and cost control is better
        than at peers.<br/><br/>
        Sector remains in good condition<br/><br/>
        The sector remains in good condition with revenue growth accelerating to 7%in 3Q and free cash flow set to
        improve in the next few years from capexreductions. While cost management at CM and CT has been less
        thandesirable this year, maintenance cost growth should ease as soon as thenetwork roll-out slows. On pricing
        and competition: we are encouraged by thetop-line growth spurred by unlimited data plans that have been
        introduced sofar but remain watchful for possible deterioration in pricing levels from here.<br/><br/>
        CU now our top pick on cost control and better-than-expected top-line growth<br/><br/>
        CU is now our top pick for its better-than-expected revenue momentum, with3Q revenue growth rising to 6% YoY
        from 2% in 1Q and 4% in 2Q. Costmanagement has also been strong. EBITDA margin has improved 60bps YTDand we see
        prospects for further margin improvement as CU consolidatesmore of its various business divisions. With better
        growth prospects and afocus on cost control, which could see capex to sales ratio in line with regionalpeers
        over the next 3years, we see significant re-rating potential as CU tradesat 3.9x FY17E EV/EBITDA vs a regional
        average of 6.5x.<br/><br/>
        We still like CM but major catalyst likely to occur only in 1H18<br/><br/>
        CM is a close second in our pecking order for its cheap valuation, marketleading position, prospects for future
        dividend increases and strong earningspower. It should also benefit from risk-off trade, given valuation support
        and avast cash holding (HKD24/share). That said, the next re-rating catalyst could besome time away, most likely
        in 1H18, when we expect CM to announce aspecial dividend on receiving cash from the towerco.<br/><br/>
        Some concerns for CT but valuation remains supportive<br/><br/>
        We have more concern for CT post the 3Q results including: 1) weaker costcontrol with EBITDA growth of 3.7% YTD
        vs peers avg of 5.7%, 2) risks from astronger CU, particularly in the enterprise segment, and 3) the Oi deal
        though itis more likely to occur at a parent level. While we have made reductions to ourearnings forecasts to
        reflect the above, CT¡¯s valuation remains supportive withthe stock trading 1standard deviation below its long
        run average EV/EBITDA.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We base our sector valuation generally on a DCF approach, which we applydue to the relatively predictable cash
        flow profiles of Chinese telcos. We use a7.5% WACC for China Telecom and China Mobile, and an 8.4% WACC forChina
        Unicom. We use 0-0.5% perpetual growth rates to reflect populationgrowth. Upside risk: cost cuts. Downside risk:
        lower ARPU from competition.</p>
