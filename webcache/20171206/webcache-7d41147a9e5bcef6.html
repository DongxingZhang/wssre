    <p> 10y CGB and 10y policy bank bond yield increased by 40bps and 70bps,respectively, in the last 2months. This
        yield of 10y CDB bond rose above 5%.This big move of rates caught the market by surprise, as the economic
        growthactually slowed in October and inflation is still below 2% (see our data flash). Whathappened to drive up
        the interet rates?<br/><br/>
        Financial sector deleveraging pushed up bond yield<br/><br/>
        Financial sector leverage can be measured by the gap between broad credit andM2growth. The gap narrowed
        significantly, reflecting the ongoing deleveragingprocess (Figure 1). We find the inverted credit-M2gap to be a
        good leadingindicator for bond yield, with a lag of about 3months (Figure 2).<br/><br/>
        What's the link between financial sector leverage and bond yield? When thefinancial sector leveraged up, smaller
        banks (city and rural commercial banks)aggressively expanded their balance sheet through wholesale funding,
        andincreased holdings of longer term safe assets. The shadow banking sector alsoincreased exposure to bonds,
        mainly through asset management funds. Smallbanks and fund houses together accounted for 82% of the incremental
        holdingsin CGBs and policy bank bonds between 2014and 2017(Figure 3).<br/><br/>
        In the deleveraging process, small banks and asset management funds becomeless expansionary (Figure 4). They
        reduced bond purchases in late 2016andearly 2017, a period when bond prices fell and yields rose. The newly
        releasedregulation on asset management products may have led to another round ofreduced bond purchases by asset
        management funds, which in turn pushed qdupbond yields.</p>
