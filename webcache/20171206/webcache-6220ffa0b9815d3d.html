    <p> Over the past two weeks US equity funds have gained further inflows as US macrosurprises continued to move
        upwards, while their European counterparts havenow suffered redemptions for two weeks, despite the fact that
        strong Euro areaPMIs for November led Euro area macro surprises to a new seven-year high. Whilefund investors
        have been sensitive to political uncertainties in the past (and muchis to say about Germany's government
        formation, the UK's Brexit divorce bill andthe Ireland question), we think the disengagement has at least partly
        to do witha diminished belief in ever stronger PMIs, which are already consistent with GDPgrowth well above
        trend growth and forecasts. We believe the flow rotation backinto the US has legs, as our expected fade in
        relative growth momentum suggestsfurther relative outflows for Europe (see Fig. 1).<br/><br/>
        In the bond fund space, and with US core inflation surprising modestly to theupside, inflows into
        inflation-protected bond funds continued to gain momentumwith weekly flows reaching a 12-month-high. On a global
        level, inflation-sensitivesector fund flows typically rise in line with US inflation expectations (Fig. 2),and a
        recovery in core inflation seems on the way, given the recovery in themanufacturing ISM over the past year.</p>
