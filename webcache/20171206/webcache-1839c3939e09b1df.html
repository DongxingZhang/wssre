    <p> HSUEH ON OIL - Decision time again<br/><br/>
        Michael Hsueh: OPEC's effort has been a moderate success. If there is anunbiased way to measure OPEC's struggle
        to support the market while alsoconstraining emergent US supply, it is shown in the price performance ofthe
        current cycle versus previous supply tightening cycles. Since implementingsupply restraint in January 2017,
        Brent front month prices have risen by 12%. Thisstands in the middle of the pack relative to previous cycles.
