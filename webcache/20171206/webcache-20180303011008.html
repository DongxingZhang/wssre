    <p> Commerce Department self-initiates, alleged dumping margin 57-60%<br/><br/>
        Typically, antidumping (AD) and countervailing duties (CVD) begin after petitionsare filed by a domestic
        industry reacting to imports that are either 'dumped' or'unfairly subsidized'. However, in this case, the
        Commerce Department (CD) hasbegun an investigation against common alloy aluminum sheet based on its ownevidence
        that China's exports may be materially injuring, or threatening materialinjury to, the common alloy sheet
        industry in the US. This is the first time a selfinitiationhas occurred in 26years. While the CD investigates
        dumping marginsof 56.54-59.72%, the International Trade Commission's (ITC) will conduct its owninvestigation.
        The ITC's preliminary determination is expected by January 16,2018. If the ITC determines injury or a threat of
        injury, the CD investigationscan continue. A preliminary CVD determination is scheduled for February 2018and a
        preliminary AD determination is scheduled for April 2018. If the CD findsdumping or unfair subsidization has
        occurred, US Customs and Border Protectioncan collect cash deposits from companies importing the subject
        aluminum sheetfrom China. Final determinations by the CD are scheduled for April 2018for CVD,and July 2018for
        the AD.<br/><br/>
        What is common alloy aluminum sheet?<br/><br/>
        The sheet under investigation is typically used in construction (gutters anddownspouts), transportation
        (trailers, traffic signs and license plates) and kitchenappliances. More specifically the imports under
        investigation are flat-rolledaluminum having thickness of 0.2-6.3mm, in coils or cut-to-length. Excluded fromthe
        investigation is aluminum can stock (used in beverage cans production). In2016, 275kt (607m lbs) of common alloy
        sheet was imported from China and wasvalued at $604m. Year to date through September imports have grown to
        279kt(615m lbs, +34% YoY), if annualized this would indicate 35% YoY growth to 372kt(820m lbs).<br/><br/>
        Possible beneficiaries<br/><br/>
        Alcoa, Arconic, Constellium and Kaiser Aluminum all have the ability to producethe commodity grade aluminum
        sheet under investigation. However, eachcurrently produces negligible, if any, amounts of the material. We
        believe importsfrom other countries could replace lost imports from China, rather than domesticproducers seeing
        entire benefit. Primary aluminum producers (Alcoa and CenturyAluminum) are unlikely to benefit on a volume
        basis, but could see improvedregional premia pricing.</p>
