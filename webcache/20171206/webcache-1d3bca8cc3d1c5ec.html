    <p> Event<br/><br/>
        Vipshop¡¯s 3Q17revenue came in 1% above consensus, but non-GAAP net profitmissed by 3%, primarily on increased
        fulfillment expenses. The company reportedits second consecutive quarter of negative OCF and FCF, with the
        amount ofoutflow increasing QoQ. We expect to see prolonged margin pressure frompromotional efforts and the
        continuous expansion of the company¡¯s last-milelogistic network, and we are cutting our FY18/19non-GAAP net
        margin forecaststo 3.8%/3.8% from 4.1%/4.2%. We are lowering our FY18/19EPS estimates7%/9% and cutting our TP
        from US$10.5to US$9, based on a 12x FY18E PER(13x previously). We maintain a Neutral rating.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        3Q earnings decline, missing consensus. Revenue for 3Q increased 28%YoY to Rmb15.3bn, 1% ahead of MQ/consensus
        estimates. This wasattributable to a 23% YoY increase in total orders and 4% growth in averageticket size.
        Non-GAAP OPM contracted 0.5ppts QoQ and 1.5ppts YoY to4.6% due to promotional efforts and increased fulfillment
        costs. Non-GAAPnet profit decreased 6% YoY to Rmb560m, 3% below consensus. Thecompany reported another quarter
        of negative OCF and FCF, at Rmb360mand Rmb575m, respectively. Management guided to 4Q revenue growth of20¨C25%
        YoY to Rmb22.8¨C23.8bn, in line with consensus.<br/><br/>
        Investment in fulfillment a weight on margin. Fulfillment expense surged 63%YoY to Rmb1.7bn in 3Q, and
        fulfillment expense as a percent of revenueincreased 1.5ppts QoQ and 2.4ppts YoY to 10.9%, due to continuous
        investmentin the logistic business and the addition of 7k delivery staff in 9M17. As of theend of September
        2017, the company had a total of 14local warehouses and2.4million square meters of warehouse space, up from
        11warehouses and2.2million sq.m at end-June. As Vipshop has guided that it will continue to investin its
        last-mile delivery network, we expect continuous margin pressure andproject non-GAAP NPM of 3.6% in 4Q17and 3.8%
        in FY18and FY19.<br/><br/>
        High-quality customer base with rising repeat customer ratio. While thegrowth of active customers decelerated to
        15% YoY from 22% in 2Q, thecompany is seeing an improvement in customer quality for both existing andnew users.
        The number of repeat customers increased 20% YoY to 20.1million, with the repeat customer ratio improving 5ppts
        QoQ and 4ppts YoY to84.4%. Orders placed by repeat customers accounted for 95% of total orders,up 1.8ppts QoQ
