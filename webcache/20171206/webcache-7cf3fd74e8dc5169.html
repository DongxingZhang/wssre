    <p> Back in October 2017, our Asia Strategy team published a framework to measure FXpositioning using data provided
        by the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation(DTCC). Following client requests, we decided to replicate the
        approach for Latam.<br/><br/>
        We used NDF trading information reported by CFTC to build indicators that assesspositioning ¨C when at extreme
        levels, it would suggest a higher probability of acorrection.<br/><br/>
        Naturally, the fact that the DTCC data only provides a limited sample of themarket¡¯s activity and the
        reliability of the positioning signals will be directlyproportional to the depth of the NDF market.<br/><br/>
        In this sense, we believe the framework suits best for the Colombian Peso and theChilean Peso. In the case of
        Brazil, the local futures market provide better signalsthan NDFs.<br/><br/>
        From a positioning point of view, none of the currencies are currently at extremelevels that would suggest a
        higher probability of a reversal.</p>
