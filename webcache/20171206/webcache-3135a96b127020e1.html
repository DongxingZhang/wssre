    <p> Results beat again; 58Home and Zhuanzhuan are even more exciting.<br/><br/>
        WUBA reported another strong quarter with top-line, bottom-line and 4Qguidance beating consensus by 7%, 64% and
        4% respectively. Benign macroenvironment and strong execution are the main drivers for the healthy result.We
        believe going to 2018, WUBA can still deliver ~25% revenue growth andcontinue to improve its non GAAP operating
        margin to ~25%. Comparing withthe strong result, what¡¯s more exciting to us is the robust growth of two
        newbusiness arms ¨C 58Home and Zhuanzhuan. 58Home has largely improved itsprofitability in 2017. Going into 2018,
        this business should not generate anyaccounting losses for WUBA after heavy losses the last two years.
        Zhuanzhuancould generate around RMB250mn in revenue in FY17, for which 3c productscontributed RMB100mn. Current
        DAU reached close to 3mn and keeps goingup. We believe this business will have more than 100% YoY growth in
        2018,especially after getting investment from both Tencent and WUBA.<br/><br/>
        Breakdown of numbers<br/><br/>
        3Q revenue grew by 33% YoY: the growth rate of property, jobs and otherverticals were 20%, 60% and 20%,
        respectively. Total paying membersincluding Anjuke/Ganji reached 2,611k, +26% YoY. Subscription extra
        ratiorecorded blended over 60% YoY and 65% YoY for 58¡¯s own platform. For 4Q17guidance, we estimate growth rate
        of property/jobs/other verticals are12%/54%/26% YoY. For 2018estimate, we believe growth rate
        ofproperty/jobs/other verticals could be 15%/45%/20% YoY respectively. Webelieve non GAAP OPM will continue to
        improve to 25% due to less spendingon advertising expenses while partly offset by Zhuanzhuan
        development.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining Buy and raising target price to USD75<br/><br/>
        We maintain Buy and raise our target price to USD75, to reflect the betterrevenue outlook and margin profile. We
        raised revenue for FY17E by 3% andlargely maintain FY18-19E revenue forecasts. We maintain 1x PEG as weexpect to
        see solid future earnings growth. We use FY17E non-GAAP EPS ofRMB10.3against a non-GAAP EPS CAGR of 47% over
        FY17E-FY20E to deriveour new target price. Key downside risks: 1) competition from news feed app,2) slow
        progress in building user stickiness, and 3) unsuccessful investment.</p>
