    <p> No white knight, expect speculators to retreat<br/><br/>
        In response to recent news articles suggesting Tencent taking a 10% stake inWangsu (Sina 26th Jan), Wangsu
        announced on 28 January that the companyhas not had any discussions with Tencent around this topic nor has
        thecompany received any such offers from Tencent. While we see some rationalethat Tencent may be interested in a
        strategic stake in Wangsu, given thestrong wording from Wangsu, such possibilities may be slimmer than what
        themarket may be hoping for (as reflected by the recent rally in its share price).<br/><br/>
        Without a white knight and with competition in the CDN market continuing tobe intense and the stock trading on
        FY17 PE of 40x, we retain our SELL.<br/><br/>
        Tencent would be a useful ally<br/><br/>
        Notwithstanding the news, we think Tencent would be a useful ally to Wangsudue the following: 1) the two can
        cross-sell into each other¡¯s client base andimprove their product offerings, 2) the two combined would have
        strongerpurchasing power when negotiating bandwidth pricing with the telecomoperators, 3) industry competitive
        dynamics may be improved if the twoindustry heavyweights were to join forces, and 4) the ability to leverage
        offeach other¡¯s resources, particularly in security software and the overseasnetwork PoPs.<br/><br/>
        What could deter the deal from happening?<br/><br/>
        We also see a few deterrents for such deal from happening which make usshunning away from the stock despite the
        appeal of potential M&amp;A;: 1) Wangsudoes not yet have a strong cloud offering and hence would not directly
        bolsterTencent¡¯s cloud capabilities, 2) earnings visibility in the CDN market remainslow and current valuation
        of Wangus is not cheap, 3) Wangsu may want toremain independent given a significant portion of their customers
        are internetcompanies and siding with one internet giant could result in customer attritionof those from the
        other camps, 4) potential difference in personalities andstrategic directions between founders of the two
        businesses.</p>
