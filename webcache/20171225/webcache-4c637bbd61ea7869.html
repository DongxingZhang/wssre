    <p> Investment Strategy: National Economic Conference emphasizes shift towards quality growth<br/><br/>
        The conference continued with the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, emphasizing theimportance of
        shifting the economy from high growth to quality growth, and solving the major socialconflicts arising from
        unbalanced development. Over the next three years, the three key missionsare: 1) to control and solve major
        risks, especially financial risks; 2) targeted poverty relief measures,and; 3) pollution control. Overall we
        believe the conference results are broadly in line with marketexpectations, but at the same time highlight some
        opportunities in specific sectors such as power,oil and gas, rail, environmental protection, education, and
        healthcare.<br/><br/>
        Healthcare: New listing rules to directly benefit smaller biotech companies<br/><br/>
        The HKEx has recently announced to overhaul the current listing rules to allow biotechnologycompanies without a
        revenue track record to be listed in Hong Kong, subject to a minimum marketcap at the time of listing of
        HK$1.5bn vs. HK$40bn for other new economy IPOs. We believe theproposed rules will greatly expand the sector¡¯s
        share of market capitalization from 3.1% at presentand will directly benefit smaller players in the biotech/life
        science tools industry. We expect thevaluation gap between US and H-share pharma names to narrow on more
        positive industry trends,such as faster pharmaceutical revenue growth, increasing R&amp;D; and development in
        targeted cancertherapy.</p>
