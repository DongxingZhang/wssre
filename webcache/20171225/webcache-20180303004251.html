    <p> The conference continued with the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, emphasizingthe importance of
        shifting the economy from high growth to quality growth, and solvingthe major social conflicts arising from
        unbalanced development. Over the next threeyears, the three key missions are: 1) to control and solve major
        risks, especially financialrisks; 2) targeted poverty relief measures, and; 3) pollution control.<br/><br/>
        Overall we believe the conference results are broadly in line with market expectations, butat the same time
        highlight some opportunities in specific sectors such as power, oil andgas, rail, environmental protection,
        education, and healthcare.<br/><br/>
        Monetary policy will remain neutral next year Proactive fiscal policy, stable monetarypolicy, a prudent money
        supply and a rational increase in credit and social financing werestressed at the conference, all indicating
        neutral monetary policy and tight liquidity in 2018.<br/><br/>
        As such, interest rates are unlikely to be lowered in the short term, but should declineslightly along with the
        announcement of detailed financial supervision.<br/><br/>
        Controlling financial risks remain the key task ¨C regulators will focus on weak areasin 2018 rather than
        comprehensive supervision as in 2017 More stringent MPAtesting, the 334 CBRC investigations, the foundation of
        China¡¯s Financial Stability Boardand new regulations on asset management all indicate substantial improvements
        in thegovernment¡¯s financial supervision capabilities.<br/><br/>
        High quality development the core working guideline for 2018 According to theconference, there are eight major
        targets in achieving high quality growth: 1) supply-sidereform; 2) encouraging market vitality; 3) boosting the
        rural economy; 4) coordinatedregional development; 5) further market opening policies; 6) improving people¡¯s
        livingstandards; 7) enriching the housing policy, and; 8) improvements to the environment.<br/><br/>
        Focus of supply side reform to shift from supply quantity cuts to supply systemreform and innovation It was
        emphasized at the conference that supply-side reformshould be the guideline for economic development. The power,
        oil and gas, and railindustries are likely to undergo reform that could lead to improvements in profitability
        aswell as mixed-ownership reform at state-owned companies. In terms of innovation, theimportance of nurturing
        leading enterprises with strong innovative ability was stressed, aswell as promoting military and civilian
        cooperation.<br/><br/>
        Reform of grain collection and storage systems and experimental projects for croprotation are newly added to the
        plan to boost the rural economy Reform of graincollection and storage systems will enable grain prices to change
        according to marketsupply and demand, while expanding experimental crop rotation projects is anotherexample of
        rural system reform, after the rural land system reform and rural collectiveproperty rights reform.<br/><br/>
        Property leasing market to grow The conference did not specifically mention propertytax but instead emphasized
        the importance of both ownership and leasing, indicating thenear term objective is to further establish the
        leasing market to complement the ownersmarket. We believe property regulations will begin to shift from short to
        long-termmeasures, and a multilevel housing supply system made up of leasing + collectiveproperty rights +
        commercial housing is expected to take shape in the future.</p>
