    <p> Commentary: Employee withheld income tax receipts are one of our favoriteeconomic indicators because they are
        timely and not subject to revision. Eachday, the Treasury releases the amount of withheld income and employment
        taxesdeposited into its accounts the previous business day. While the daily readingsare highly volatile, when we
        smooth the data to distill the quarterly trend, theybecome a decent real-time proxy for nominal income growth.
        The recent readingson tax receipts point to a noticeable pick up in underlying income growth andmay even be
        signaling a long-awaited improvement in wage growth.<br/><br/>
        In order to identify the underlying trend in an otherwise noisy data set, we sum theprevious 60 days of tax
        receipts and calculate the year-over-year growth rate ofthe 60-day totals. We then take the 60-day moving
        average of the year-over-yeargrowth rates.1 As we can see in the figure below, the latest data show tax
        receiptsgrowing at 5.9% - a sturdy improvement relative to the 4.5% growth rate aroundthis time last year. While
        there is little debate that the labor market is nearingfull employment, if not already beyond that point,
        policymakers have continuedto fret lack-luster wage growth. Tax receipts may be providing an important cluein
        this regard.<br/><br/>
        Aggregate income growth is a function of employment gains, wage growth andhours worked. While the tax receipts
        data do not allow us to identify exactly whichof these components is driving the trend, the monthly employment
        report allowsus to make some assumptions. Most striking to us is that the recent accelerationin tax receipts has
        coincided with a modest deceleration in job gains. Recall thatnonfarm payroll growth topped out in February 2015
        at 2.3% and has since slowedto 1.4% as of November. This is typical at this point in the business cycle asjob
        growth tends to slow as excess labor slack is absorbed. Indeed, nonfarmpayrolls are up 2.07 million over the
        last 12 months, down from a 2.3 million gainover the 12 months ending in November of last year. This means that
        the risein income growth evident in tax receipts is either being driven by wage growth,hours worked, or a
        combination of the two.<br/><br/>
        While hours worked rose a tenth in November to 34.5, the year-to-date averagehas been 34.4, the same as it was
        in November 2016. However, the year-over-yeargrowth rate of average hourly earnings, according to the BLS, was
        just 2.47% lastmonth, down from 2.65% this time last year. In other words, while tax receiptspoint to a
        meaningful pick up in the pace of income growth, the nonfarm payroll data point to a steady trend in hours
        worked, slowing job gains and a slightdeceleration in wage growth. To be sure, the employment data could always
        berevised, and we would not be surprised for this to eventually be the case.<br/><br/>
        However, in our view, it is more likely that wage gains are being understatedrather than employment or hours.
        This is because the deceleration in employmentgains has been relatively steady over the past couple of years and
        hours workeddo not tend to deviate much from trend. In summary, the recent readings ontax receipts not only
        point to firming underlying economic momentum, but mayalso indicate that wage growth is finally picking up.
        Interestingly, this would beconsistent with our earlier analysis on the non-linearity of the Phillips curve
        here,whereby we identified the current 4.1% unemployment rate as the key point atwhich the Phillips curve starts
        to kink.</p>
