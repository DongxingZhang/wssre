    <p> Korea¡¯s Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE) yesterday during its 2ndrenewable energy policy meeting
        outlined Renewable Energy 3020, with the plan¡¯s digitpairs switched to represent the 2030 goal of raising the
        nation¡¯s portion of new renewableenergy source power generation to 20% under the 8th NEP (see our Dec 15 story,
        ¡°8thNational Electricity Plan unveiled¡±). This latest proposal should be finalized under theministry¡¯s 4th Basic
        Plan for Renewable Energy in early 2018.<br/><br/>
        New renewable energy source power generation: Renewable Energy 3020targets Korea¡¯s new renewable energy source
        power generation rising by 48.7GW by2030, with an interim goal of it being raised by 12.4GW by 2022. The 2030
        targetincludes respective capacity additions of 30.8GW and 16.5GW from solar and wind.<br/><br/>
        Participation of citizens and local governments to be sought: The latest planwill seek to incentivize the
        participation of citizens and corporations by expandingprivate solar power facilities in urban areas and
        expanding solar power generation inrural areas. Officials will also likely select and supply land suitable for
        such powergeneration after revising Korea¡¯s New Renewable Energy Law next year.<br/><br/>
        RPS targets for large power-generation players to rise: Sizeable powergenerationprojects comprise 60% of 48.7GW
        capacity expansion targeted under theplan, which calls for increased renewable energy power output by gradually
        raisingrenewable portfolio standards (RPS) targets¡ªie, mandatory supply ratios for thoselarge firms.<br/><br/>
        New energy business promotion: The proposed measures are also meant tostrengthen the competitiveness of Korea¡¯s
        renewable energy industry via increasedR&amp;D; support, with the plan also set to foster the power brokerage
        market and lead togrowth in ESS and fuel cells to encourage distributed power generation.</p>
