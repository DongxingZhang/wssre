    <p> China¡¯s 3-day annual Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) ended on Wed (20 Dec).<br/><br/>
        The meeting is held at the end of each year to establish economic policy direction for theupcoming
        year.<br/><br/>
        The 2017 edition is even more closely watched as it will not only set the tone for 2018, but alsomarks the
        beginning of the second term of Xi Jinping¡¯s government which is being proclaimed asentering into a ¡°new era¡± at
        the 19th National Congress earlier in Oct.<br/><br/>
        The CEWC continued to emphasize on growth and stability, as well as to maintain a prudentand neutral monetary
        policy in 2018 as it strives to balance stable economic growth and liquiditywhile averting financial risks
        accumulated over years of ¡°credit binges¡± and ¡°lax regulations¡±,according to Xinhua News, while the RMB exchange
        rate will be kept basically stable at areasonable and balanced level.<br/><br/>
        With cumulative economic growth in the first 3 quarters of 2017 at 6.9%, the full year target of6.5% should be
        easily met. For 2018, we anticipate China¡¯s economic growth to remain largelystable at 6.7%. Going forward, the
        slowdown in growth rate is within expectation given focus onquality and more balanced growth and the ongoing
        deleveraging. Following the meeting, the keyeconomic targets for 2018 will be announced during the annual
        parliamentary session in Marchas part of the government work report.<br/><br/>
        As has been flagged earlier, the latest CEWC focused on three key areas for China¡¯s economicpolicy not just for
        2018, but also for the next 3 years, highlighting: 1) preventing major risks, 2)targeted poverty alleviation and
        3) pollution control as the "three tough battles" for the next threeyears.<br/><br/>
        Poverty alleviation and pollution control are largely domestic focus of public well-being and¡°bread and butter¡±
        issues, encompassing education, infant care, employment, pension insurance,eldercare, medical treatment,
        anti-pollution measures, among others. These highlight onceagain China¡¯s determination and efforts to shift
        towards ¡°quality of growth¡± rather than ¡°quantityof growth¡± or ¡°speed of growth¡± and therefore less emphasis
        will be placed on the growth ratesahead.<br/><br/>
        As for prevention of systemic risks, the authorities are also casting a wider net on irregular andillegal
        activities in the financial industry to forestall risks, and are stepping up efforts to curbwidespread
        irregularities in the sector to guard against risks. According to Xinhua News, in thefirst ten months of 2017,
        China's banking regulatory authorities have imposed administrativepenalties in 2,617 cases of irregularities in
        the industry, covering state-owned banks, joint-equitybanks and city commercial banks.<br/><br/>
        One area of concern for market participants has always been the amount of leverage in theChina¡¯s financial
        system. We are reasonably confident that the overall debt situation in China ismanageable given that the
        authorities are taking steps to address the issue and there are ampleresources to contain a fallout. Indeed the
        build-up in debt in China has stabilized in recent yearsafter expanding sharply since 2008 as deleveraging
        measures begin to take effect. However, asnoted in the chart, one sector that has experienced rapid increase is
        the household sector thathas seen its debt amount rising more than 4 times, from 10.8% of GDP to 46.8% of GDP by
        2Q2017.</p>
