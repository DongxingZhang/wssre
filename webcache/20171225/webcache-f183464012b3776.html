    <p> The election of Cyril Ramaphosa as the new president of South Africa¡¯s ruling ANCparty has been welcomed by
        markets, but we see the rally in the ZAR as excessive.<br/><br/>
        Our analysis of FX returns shows that 1-week and 1-month forward realised returnsare at levels that in the past
        have been followed by strong mean reversion. Lastmonth, returns did not mean revert but the likelihood of mean
        reversion has nowincreased, in our view, as the market has priced out rate hikes.<br/><br/>
        The event premium ahead of the ANC conference was elevated but volatilitycollapsed after the conference. Risk
        reversals indicate that it is currently cheap to buyoptions positioning for USDZAR topside.<br/><br/>
        Trade: At spot 12.63, buy for 0.6% of notional value a 1-month USDZAR call spreadwith strikes at 13.00/13.50.
        The maximum payout with spot at 13.50 on the day ofexpiry is 3.7%.</p>
