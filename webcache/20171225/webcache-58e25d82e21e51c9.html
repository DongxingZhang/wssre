    <p> As expected, the Central Bank of Taiwan (CBC) left its benchmark discount rate unchanged at1.375% for the sixth
        consecutive quarter today. In its previous moves, the CBC had cut interestrates by a cumulative 50 bps at its
        quarterly decision meetings between 3Q15 to 2Q16.<br/><br/>
        The CBC said that it will maintain appropriately loose monetary policy and that the interest rateis appropriate
        for current level of growth. While reiterating that it sees output gap remaining inthe negative territory next
        year, the CBC also said that current inflation is stable and outlook ismild. Comments point to CBC¡¯s bias to
        stay on hold for the time being.<br/><br/>
        The central bank also raised slightly its GDP and inflation forecasts for 2018 to 2.35% (from 2.29%in Nov
        forecast) and 1.12% (from 0.96%). Notably, this is well below the ¡°most appropriate¡±inflation rate of 2% cited
        by Governor Perng Fai-nan. The CBC will maintain M2 growth target of2.5-6.5% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        While exports numbers signaled positive momentum going into 2018 (exports and new exportorders growth rebounded
        to 14.0% y/y and 11.6% y/y respectively in November) , the lack ofdemand-side inflationary pressures coupled
        with risk of export slowdown in 2H18 are expectedto keep the CBC on hold next year.<br/><br/>
        Headline inflation has been weighed down by lower food prices mainly due to a high base effect.<br/><br/>
        Any subsequent recovery will likely be fairly subdued. We are expecting a slightly higher inflationrate of 1.0%
        in 2018 compared to around 0.6% this year. The impact of the 3% wage hike forpublic sector employees from
        January 2018 remains to be seen, depending on whether this willbe translated to wage increase in the private
        sector and the potential boost for private demand.<br/><br/>
        One of the comments in the policy statement was the recent appreciation of the TWD whichtightened the financial
        condition in the country. Governor Perng said that the appreciation in thecurrency has offset imported inflation
        and also highlighted the greater impact of the exchangerate than interest rates on growth.<br/><br/>
        The TWD has appreciated by around 7.6% against USD YTD, making it one of the bestperformingcurrencies in Asia.
        Further strengthening will be limited as CBC maintains its existingaccommodative monetary policy while US
        continues to normalize and some of the Asian centralbanks are moving to reduce their monetary accommodation. We
        maintain our forecast of rangetrading in USD/TWD around 30.00 across 1H2018 before rising to 30.20 in 3Q18 and
        30.50 in4Q18. The supportive outlook for TWD in 1H18 should continue to cap risks of imported
        inflation.<br/><br/>
        Note that this is the last monetary policy meeting presided by Governor Perng as his term endsin February 2018
        after leading the central bank for 20 years. The next rate decision will be on 22Mar 2018. Market expects that a
        promotion from within the CBC to succeed Perng to maintainthe policy continuity.</p>
