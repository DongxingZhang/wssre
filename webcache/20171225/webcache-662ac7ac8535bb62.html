    <p> The reform agenda has been in focus in recent weeks, with congress a hive of activity andsocial unrest over
        recently approved changes to the pension system. Extraordinarycongressional sessions are to continue until the
        end of the year, with legislative activity to beresumed in February 2018.<br/><br/>
        The law that changed the formula according to which pensions are adjusted was finallyapproved on 19 December,
        but at a considerable political cost to the ruling Cambiemos coalition(with a failed attempt to reach a quorum)
        and amid demonstrations in the streets. Thisunderscored the fragility of political alliances and how difficult
        Cambiemos might find it to passcontroversial legislation in congress.<br/><br/>
        Under the new law, pensions will be adjusted by a formula that gives 70% weight to consumerprices and 30% to
        wages. According to the treasury, the approved changes will save slightlyless than 0.5% of GDP in 2018. To
        mitigate the impact of the change in Q1 2018, a governmentdecree will implement compensation worth ARS 4bn,
        according to official sources. The provinceof Buenos Aires has also voted to raise the minimum retirement age
        for specific workers.<br/><br/>
        We consider these changes to be the first step on a long road to making Argentina¡¯s pensionsystem sustainable.
        In light of the lack of a congressional majority for Cambiemos andwidespread popular discontent with the
        recently approved initiative, we think the government islikely to wait until after the 2019 presidential
        election before putting forward further substantialchanges, such as an increase in the minimum retirement
        age.<br/><br/>
        Pension reform has probably been the most controversial initiative. We expect the congress toapprove most of the
        rest of the reform package without material concessions, probably beforethe end of the year. On 20 December, the
        lower chamber approved the tax reform by 146 votesto 77 ¨C a larger margin than the pension changes (for more on
        the tax reforms, please seeArgentina: Taxing times, dated 1 November). The government hopes for senate approval
        of thisreform next week (see Table 1).<br/><br/>
        Other initiatives that still need approval include the 2018 budget law, the fiscal responsibilityagreement with
        provincial governors and labour and capital markets reform. The labour reformhas for some time looked unlikely
        to be approved before the end of the year, and press reportssuggest it now looks certain to be postponed until
        March. Labour reforms are a potentiallycontroversial issue that might trigger a rise in social tension,
        something that the ruling coalitionwould be likely to prefer to avoid before year-end.<br/><br/>
        The opposition has also decided to postpone debate on the bill that seeks to foster developmentof the country¡¯s
        capital markets ¨C arguably, a setback for Cambiemos but not, in our view, amajor one.</p>
