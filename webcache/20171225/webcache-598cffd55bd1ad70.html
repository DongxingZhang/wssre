    <p> Back in June 2017, we published our first note on LME Cooper, arguing that therewere no compelling reasons to
        expect a correction to the downside going forward(Copper: A tale of two forces).<br/><br/>
        Indeed, base metals showed a very strong performance since then, with 3-monthLME Copper going up 25% and
        reaching the highest value since 2014.<br/><br/>
        While our model continues to point to an upward trend for copper prices in thecoming months, it also suggests
        that in the short-term the appreciation pace mighthave been too fast.<br/><br/>
        Our factor model indicates a ~10% dislocation between current market prices andthe fair value for 3-month LME
        copper.<br/><br/>
        Strategy: go short 3mo LME Copper (LMCADS03) at USD 7,071; Allocation: USD5.3mn equivalent (30 contracts);
        Initial target: 6,300; Dynamic stop loss starting at:USD 7,600/MT.<br/><br/>
        Caveat: technicals are not fully supportive for this trade. According to our lastreport, positioning and stocks
        in copper do not show evidence of a strong imminentprice correction.</p>
