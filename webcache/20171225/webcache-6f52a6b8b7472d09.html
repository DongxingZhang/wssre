    <p> We currently hold an USDBRL one touch at 3.10 which matures in 26-Jan-18.<br/><br/>
        This strategy was recommended following our BEER and FEER models for BRL,which suggest that the currency is
        cheap to the US dollar. Also, we wanted to bepositioned for a positive tail risk coming from the political and
        reform fronts inDecember 2017-Q1 2018.<br/><br/>
        The technical position of the real has improved steadily over the last quarter.<br/><br/>
        Going back to valuation, BEER points to a short term fair value closer to 3.12whereas FEER suggests a structural
        equilibrium of 2.88, based on the sustainablecurrent account concept (Latam FX quarterly: FEER model values
        update).<br/><br/>
        Strategy: Sell the USDBRL one touch in place and buy a USDBRL one-touch at 3.12,maturing in 19 March 2018. Net
        Premium: 22% (spot reference: 3.2860). Allocation:USD 1.5mn.<br/><br/>
        Current NDF positions: We are keeping the structural long BRL strategy in relativevalue against a basket of AUD,
        CLP, and EUR.</p>
