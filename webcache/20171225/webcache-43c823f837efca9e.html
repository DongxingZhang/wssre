    <p> ICE shipment continuedto slow down in Nov-17 dragged by decelerating sales of CVtrucks. However, PV sales
        remainedstable during the same period, particularly underpinned by rising sales of A0class sedanmodels.Given
        that the tax hike will become effective in FY18E, we believe small-engine sedans shipment will maintainstrong
        during the remainderof 2017.<br/><br/>
        NEV accumulated shipment in 11M17 have exceeded 600k unitsand is expected toreach 700k units in FY17E and 900k
        units in FY18Erespectively, according toour estimationon the assumptionthat the government willkeep the
        subsidiesin FY18E at the same level in 2017.<br/><br/>
        In our view, it is still possible for thegovernment to slashNEV subsidies in FY18E, which is one year earlier
        than the schedule, citing expenditure increase as a result of shipment surge during the year. Nevertheless, we
        expect a narrowing reduction in FY18E compared with FY17E, thereforeto postlimited impact on the NEV shipment in
        1H18.</p>
