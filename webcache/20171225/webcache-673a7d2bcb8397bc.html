    <p> Q3 real GDP growth disappointed at 1.8% YoY, declining 0.7pps from previous quarter. On the supply side, the
        slowdown in Q3 was led by the transportation sector and industry. The industry slowdown had been pronounced
        averaging 1.1% YoY, 2.8pps lower than the average in Q2. Strong retail trade and improving agricultural output
        appear to have supported growth. On the demand side, strong wage growth, improving consumer confidence, lower
        savings by households induced by declining real rates, improving household credit and declining inflation all
        are likely to have contributed to the strong momentum in household demand in Q3. Earlier peak in corporate
        profits is supportive for investments, albeit at a lower pace than in Q2 which was also aided by
        restocking.<br/><br/>
        In November, retail sales and IP disappointed. Both retail sales and IP growth rates surprised on the downside
        in November, falling 0.4pps and 3.6pps respectively to 2.7% YoY and -3.6% YoY. Real wages growth remained
        constant at 5.4% YoY. As a result, real disposable income declined by 0.3%, a positive surprise, as compared to
        -1.7% fall in October.<br/><br/>
        The worrying divergence between real wages and disposable income. The recovery in real wages growth since 2016
        has not translated into improving real disposable income growth in Russia and the gap between the two is
        widening. The latter kept deteriorating in 2016, mainly on account cuts in government social security payments
        and higher taxes on certain items. In fact, real disposable income seems to be following the real pension
        payments growth trajectory since 2016. The on-time spike in disposable income in Jan-17 was mainly on account of
        a jump in pension payments, and has since then subsided.<br/><br/>
        Relative improvement in forward-looking indicators of demand. The monthly indicator of consumer confidence along
        with almost all sub-components improved or remained constant in November. The steepest hike was in the ¡°personal
        financial situation during next year¡± sub-component.<br/><br/>
        Inflation continued to trend down. Inflation fell to a new low of 2.5% YoY in November (2.5% consensus
        forecast). Core inflation also decelerated to 2.4% YoY (2.3% consensus). Inflation expectations remain volatile,
        but have fallen sharply in November to a new historical low of 8.7% (9.9% in October) Deflationary trend is
        likely to continue on the back of falling food inflation, mainly due to increased supply and shortage of
        storage, and aided by exchange rate strength into the year-end.<br/><br/>
        The CBR surprised the markets in December by easing more than expected (DB and market consensus for 25bps) and
        took its key policy rate to 7.75%. The statement and press conference made emphasis on the fact that the higher
        than expected easing was primarily driven by the "extension of the agreement to reduce oil production, [which
        brought] pro-inflationary risks down over a one-year horizon". As the CBR progresses towards a more neutral
        stance, we believe it is likely to become increasingly more data driven. Thus, given our growth and inflation
        projections, we maintain our call for further easing next year, in 25bps steps, likely skewed to H1-2018.</p>
