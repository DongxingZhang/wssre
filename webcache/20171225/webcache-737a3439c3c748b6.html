    <p> BJP retained Gujarat and won in Himachal Pradesh state elections: Withstate election campaigns dominating the
        political discourse in the last twomonths, the final results today were at the lower end of the exit polls.
        Theelection results for Gujarat are more important, given that PM Modi hails fromthe state and results were
        going to be analysed in the backdrop of policymeasures such as demonetization and implementation of
        GST.<br/><br/>
        BJP wins Gujarat with fewer seat margin compared with 2012, with lossof seats in rural areas: BJP won 99seats
        (as per the Election Commission,8pm IST) in the 2017state elections, lower than the tally of 115seats won
        in2012. Specifically, the results indicate that BJP has fared poorly in the ruralareas in which it won 44of the
        98rural seats in 2012. Encouragingly, the voteshare for BJP rose to 49.2% from 48.3% in 2012; however, this is
        still trailingthe peak of the 2014general elections.<br/><br/>
        Urban voters still back BJP, demonetization / GST seem to be nonissues:The BJP maintained its stronghold in
        urban areas, winning threefourthsof the urban seats, indicating that demonetization / GST have notswayed voters
        away from BJP. Taking Surat as an example, as it isdominated by small businesses most impacted by demonetization
        and GST,BJP won 15of the 16seats.¡ì What does this imply for policy reform? Quieter times ahead, focus toshift to
        rural: With BJP winning both the state elections in Gujarat and HP,political stability has been reinforced.
        However, as the winning margin hasnarrowed in Gujarat with a poor showing in rural areas, we expect it is
        likelythe government will focus more on the rural and agriculture sector withmeasures such as MSP prices for
        more crops, buffer stocking for cropstrading below MSP, public investment in agriculture mainly related to
        storagefacilities as well as having a greater focus on implementation of ruralinfrastructure projects (rural
        roads / rural affordable housing).<br/><br/>
        Focus back to key economic events over next three months: With theGujarat election event now behind us, focus
        should turn back to importanteconomic events ¨C bank recapitalization, the union budget in early-February,GST
        collections. In our view, the focus should be on implementation of theannounced reforms in FY19rather than any
        other ¡°big bang¡± announcement.<br/><br/>
