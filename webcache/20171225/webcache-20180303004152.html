    <p> A potential source of positive surprise in the coming years, in our view<br/><br/>
        We have highlighted upside potential from the new 160km/h push-pull trainmodel (a new member of the CEMU family)
        after our field trip to China in October(see our trip takeaways). Recent newsflow and our conversations with
        industryparticipants suggest the progress is ahead of expectation and the upside potentialmay be bigger than our
        expectation. We estimate a full replacement of the 25Tmodel (with this new push-pull model) will require a total
        investment of Rmb50bn+ over a period as short as five years, yielding meaningful upside potential to bothCRRC
        and Zhuzhou CRRC. We reiterate Buy on both stocks with Zhuzhou beingour preferred pick.<br/><br/>
        What is this 160km/h push-pull train model?<br/><br/>
        A push-pull train has locomotives at both ends so there is always one locomotivepushing and one locomotive
        pulling, with one designed as a powered car(propulsive unit) and the other an unpowered control car. According
        to local mediaCaixin, the first batch of trains (produced by CRRC) already sent to Chongqingfor trial run is a
        7-carriage model that has one powered locomotive and oneunpowered control locomotive, and will likely be the
        standard configuration forsuch model. The 160km/h push-pull model is reportedly deployed to replace oldtrain
        models (i.e. 25T and 25G) that are currently running on ordinary-speedrailway lines.<br/><br/>
        Possible reasons for CRC launching this train model<br/><br/>
        One apparent benefit of deploying this model is efficiency improvement. Unlikethe existing old models, the
        propulsive locomotive does not need to be removedfrom the train at termini because the push-pull train can be
        driven from eachend. It is an intermediate step between normal locomotive-hauled operation andfull multiple-unit
        operation, which is a cost-effective way for CRC to improveoperational efficiency. Moreover, our recent checks
        with industry participantssuggest that the launch of this model could be an important part of CRC's biggerplan
        to hike passenger tariffs for ordinary-speed railway lines - by offering betterride quality through new fleet,
        CRC now has one more reason to raise tariffs, apartfrom the fact that passenger tariffs have been kept unchanged
        for more than 20years in China. This also explains why CRC has prioritized the development of thismodel
        immediately after the successful launch of its 350km/h CEMU model.</p>
