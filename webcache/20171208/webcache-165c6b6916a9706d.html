    <p> Soaring coal price and production volume drove a stunning performance: See the tablebelow, revenue from coal
        mining segment, main top line contributor, was mainly drivenby the booming coal prices in 3Q17. The 9M17 sales
        volume had surpassed 5.5mn tonneswhich were the full year result in FY16. Management has revised down the full
        year targetto 7mn to 8mn tonnes from the initial 10mn tonnes of coal sales due to the disruption ofprolonged
        monsoon season in 2Q and 3Q17. The coal price (ICI 4,200 GAR) remains onthe bull run, arriving at YTD high of
        c.US$50/tonne in Oct-17.</p>
