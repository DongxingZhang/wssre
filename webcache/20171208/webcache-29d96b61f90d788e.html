    <p> Growth rate held up in Oct 2017. In general, we continue to see divergence in the share price performance of the
        HK-listed technology hardwarenames with a) bigger caps outperforming small-mid caps, and b) hot sectors vs.
        lagging sectors. Those with exposure to high-growth areas, such asoptical communications and semi-conductors (AI
        related), outperformed the sector, and the HSI and MSCI on a one-month basis. Because of positivemessages from
        Apple and Oct 2017 shipment figures released by Taiwanese listed peers, those with exposure to several
        components such as a)OLED (Truly [0732.HK], Varitronix [0710.HK] and Solomon Systech [2878.HK]), b) hybrid
        lenses/3D sensing (AAC [2018.HK and Sunny Optical[2382.HK]), and c) flexible PCBs, also did well recently,
        outperforming other handset component names. Recent data points from Taiwan-listed technologynames may suggest
        that growth in the sector continued in Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017, and it seems that iPhone X is one of the growth
        drivers. TheTaiwan-listed technology names (materials &amp; equipment, wafers, semiconductors, IC design, LEDs,
        TFT-LCDs, packaging &amp; testing, lenses, DRAMs,ODMs, optical components &amp; casings, networking, PCBs, auto
        electronics, terminals and distribution) reported their Oct 2017 turnover, and we notethat overall top-line
        growth in Oct 2017 was sustainable in Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017. Sector wide, materials &amp; equipment, foundries,
        casings, lenses,ODMs, components, optical communications, distribution and terminals saw higher top-line YoY
        growth in Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017. Even though wedidn¡¯t see a pick-up in the growth rate in other sectors, like IC
        design, wafers, PCBs and packaging &amp; testing, in Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017, they didn¡¯tdecelerate further.
        Apple-related companies, like TSMC, Win Semi, Catcher, Merry, Largan, TPK and Foxconn Technology, reported
        faster turnovergrowth in Oct 2017 vs. Sep2017, which suggests that camera modules, 3D sensing, casings and
        displays are major beneficiaries of the official launchof iPhone X. Recent news flow confirms our view that the
        market is still somewhat confident about iPhone X sales (even with the shift to 2018 insteadof Q4 2017), as
        Apple still has first-mover advantage over the Android camp. We still suggest that investors hold a medium- to
        long-term view of theApple supply chain, as it will take time for Android to catch up with Apple. Regarding
        specific components, we still believe that camera modules/lenses, displays and PCBs (flexible &amp; substrate
        grade) look more interesting, since the market is talking about next stage of development, suchas hybrid lens
        solutions, 3D sensing and flexible OLEDs. The Chinese IC supply chain, especially HK-listed foundries, was
        re-rated in past month,given news flow, government support, and the fact that semi-conductors are a key segment
        in the development of new technologies such as AI andcloud computing.<br/><br/>
        Regarding the PC side, Acer reported YoY turnover growth in Oct 2017 vs. negative growth in Sep and positive YoY
        growth in Aug and Jul 2017, butAsustek reported negative YoY turnover growth in Oct 2017 vs. positive growth in
        Sep 2017 and negative in Apr-Aug 2017. So far the news flow(including MSI and Gigabyte) in our view, still
        suggests that the PC industry continues to perform well despite concerns about the growth outlook. Inthe Hong
        Kong market, messages from both Sunny Optical [2382.HK] and Q-Tech [1478.HK] indicate that the growth outlook
        can vary for differentplayers in the same industry. Sunny Optical released its Oct 2017 shipment figures, which
        showed a pick-up in growth of shipments of camera modules,which increased 5.3% MoM and 11.9% YoY to about 29.5m
        units (Sep 2017: 16.7% MoM decline and 6.5% YoY growth). It seems that SunnyOptical is benefitting from the
        release of flagship models by major customers such as Huawei. QTech¡¯s total Oct 2017 camera module shipments
        rose2.5% MoM and dropped 24.9% YoY to 15.1m units. In the camera module segment, 8MP and below rose 29.5% MoM
        and dropped 50.8% YoY toabout 7m units in Oct 2017, and 13MP and above dropped 13.2% MoM and increased 38.6% YoY
        to about 8.1m units. It seems that Q-Tech¡¯s Oct2017 product mix is not as favourable as that in Sep 2017, as
        lower-end products (8MP and below) should offer lower margins than the higher-endproducts. We would like to
        highlight that NewMax¡¯s shipment figures remained weak in Oct 2017, which is a concern to us. To a certain
        extent, we stillmaintain our cautious view of QTech. AAC [2018.HK] released its Q3 2017 results, which also
        cleared up market concerns.<br/><br/>
        Handsets. We saw divergence in the share price performance of HK-listed handset component suppliers, given: a)
        increasing attention to certain subsegments,such as OLED displays and hybrid lens solutions, and b) the release
        of results and shipment figures by leading names such as AAC, SunnyOptical and Q-Tech. Hybrid lens solutions
        names and OLED display names, such as AAC [2018.HK], Sunny Optical, Truly [0732.HK] and Varitronix[0710.HK],
        outperformed. Apart from Apple¡¯s results and guidance, the Oct 2017 turnover figures of Apple suppliers (TSMC,
        Catcher, TPK, GIS, Flexium,Merry, Largan and WINS) remained on the positive side, which boosted sentiment on
        Apple-related names that have exposure to casings,lenses, 3D sensing, PCBs and acoustics. We saw a major
        re-rating of AAC and Sunny Optical, given their exposure to the optics segment and company-specific reasons:
        e.g. a) AAC¡¯s WLG maybe a disruptive development for the industry, and b) Sunny Optical¡¯s partnership with ams
        and its inclusionin the HSI boosted sentiment. Apart from exposure to OLED, we may see re-rating potential for
        Truly. Industry news flow suggests that Oppo andXiaomi will adopt 3D-sensing solutions for models to be launched
        in 2018, as well as solutions that are being developed by Himax &amp; Qualcomm andsensor modules being produced
        by Truly. At this stage, we can¡¯t verify the news. But if Truly is selected as a supplier of 3D sensing modules,
        in ourview, it will change market sentiment on Truly significantly, as the market used to treat Truly as a
        laggard in new technology development. At thisstage, we haven¡¯t seen Q-Tech¡¯s strategy and roadmap on lens
        development and 3D sensing. Investors might switch from Q-Tech if the Companylags behind in new technology
        development. We are somewhat positive on names like Cowell [1415.HK] and FIT Hon Teng [6088.HK] even thoughthey
        don¡¯t have exposure to high-growth areas. Their current valuation and share price partly reflects market
        concerns. They may catch up if marketsentiment stabilizes. We still suggest investors take a long-term view. We
        would like to highlight that Apple had a major product upgrade in 2017, andeven if shipment volume is flat
        (which we don¡¯t think will happen, as iPhone¡¯s huge installed base should support volume growth), the component
        supplierswill benefit from an ASP increase. Apple is likely to have an advantage in key component supply, such
        as OLED displays and 3D sensing modules,and the Chinese brands are unlikely to catch up in the near
        term.<br/><br/>
        PCs. PCB and gaming notebook suppliers, including MSI and Gigabyte, reported faster monthly YoY sales growth in
        Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017. Aceralso picked up in monthly YoY sales in Oct 2017 vs. Sep 2017.ODMs, on average,
        continued to report solid monthly turnover figures in Oct 2017. ThePC supply chain shouldn¡¯t offer any major
        downside surprises. HK-listed PC-related names, such as Lenovo [0992.HK], didn¡¯t generate major positivenews
        flow with their results, but any improvement in sentiment may boost Lenovo¡¯s share price performance. However,
        at this stage, we can¡¯t find amajor re-rating catalyst for Ju Teng [3336.HK] which is expected to continue to
        underperform.</p>
