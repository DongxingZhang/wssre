    <p> Over the past month EURUSD has been moving in line with its STEER?. Over the past week the rise of the US 10y
        yield hascaused STEER to start declining, reaching 1.1797.<br/><br/>
        Optimism around Brexit negotiations has led GBPUSD to rise to 1.2 z-score above its STEER of 1.3268. While the
        deviation is notlarge enough to trigger a short trading signal, this suggests that there is scope for the GBP to
        decline if political uncertaintyremains high.<br/><br/>
        STEER remains long USDZAR targeting 13.8816. Fair value has remained fairly stable since the peak of the EM
        sell-off last month.<br/><br/>
        Heading into South Africa GDP release on Tuesday, STEER continues to indicate that USDZAR has scope to
        rally.<br/><br/>
