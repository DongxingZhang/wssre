    <p> The outlook is stable to positive. The tone of management commentary is now moreupbeat compared to previous
        quarters, mentioning that the recovery in the US economycould have a positive impact on the aluminium industrial
        product business. This refers tothe aluminium frames for container refrigeration units. We note that in the
        recent 3Q 2017earnings presentation by United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), commercial sales for
        TransportRefrigeration was ¡°up high single digit¡±. This was an improvement over 2Q (¡°up low singledigit¡±) and 1Q
        (¡°down high single digit¡±).<br/><br/>
        Domestically, Nam Lee could potentially benefit from the pipeline of infrastructure projectsand spate of
        collective-sales. Any revenue recognition though, would probably only be atleast two years from now, coinciding
        with the tail-end of the projects.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Buy; higher target price of $0.56(previously $0.51)<br/><br/>
        Our target price represents an implied 11.1x FY18e forward P/E multiple and 0.96x FY18eforward P/B multiple. The
        2.0cents dividend offers an attractive yield of 5.1% based on thelast close price of $0.395. We currently
        forecast 2.5cents dividends for FY18e and maintainour view of Nam Lee as a yield-play.</p>
