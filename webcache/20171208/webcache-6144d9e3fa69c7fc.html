    <p> With only four weeks of 2017 remaining, bond funds will likely be this year'sinflow winner, having seen ~$350
        billion of inflows year-to-date. This alreadysecures that, by the end of 2017, global bond funds will have seen
        the strongestyear on their record, taking the place of the $200 billion seen in 2014. Thiscompares to $280
        billion of inflows for global equity funds this year, which, whilealso set for a new annual record themselves,
        will once again lose out on relativeterms. Since 2009, the low yield environment has resulted in a large
        allocation ofmoney into fixed income, and every time the rate normalization got pushed outfurther, bond funds
        kept gaining relative to equities (see Fig. 1). In fact, over thepast ten years, global equity funds have only
        once seen stronger annual flows thanbonds, when in 2013, the Fed's taper announcements resulted in brief but
        strongbond fund redemptions. But the allocation gap between bonds and equities isnow back at its largest (thanks
        to last year's flight out of equity mandates), and wethink it will not meaningfully close anytime soon, as we
        believe that moves in theUS 10-year bond yield are explained first and foremost by global PMI momentum,which
        points to downside risks to yields over the coming months. Given the strongdeterminant US bond yields are for
        the equity-to-bond rotation, our projectionsuggests a trend reversal to only start in the second half of next
        year (see Fig. 2).</p>
