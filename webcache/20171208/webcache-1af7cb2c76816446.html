    <p> What were the key takeaways from DBS Investor Day?<br/><br/>
        DBS¡¯ Investor Day main theme was digital strategy and how it is applied to differentmarkets to drive the bank
        forward.<br/><br/>
        Digital strategy 1: Consumer/SME banking in Singapore and Hong Kong. DBS is adoptingthe digital platform
        approach to engage their customers and digitising their bankingprocesses. The aim is to pre-empt new digital
        disruptors in the legacy markets where DBS isan incumbent. The digital process reduced the cost to income ratio
        from 49% in 2015to43% in 2017as income growth outpaced cost growth and ROE improved from 22% in 2015to 24% in
        2017. DBS aspires to improve the cost-income ratio further to less than 40%.Digital strategy 2: Consumer/SME
        banking in growth markets including India andIndonesia. DBS is using the digital approach to acquire clients at
        a low cost and achievescale in product distribution. The aim is to disrupt the banking incumbents in the
        growthmarkets that have large swathes of physical branches. Fighting head on with physicalbranches in these
        growth markets would be uneconomical and less effective. Income fromConsumer &amp; SME banking in growth markets
        including India and Indonesia is expected togrow 20% CAGR.<br/><br/>
        Digital strategy 3: Corporate banking, Private banking, Markets and Others at group level.Private banking and
        cash management have experienced higher transaction turnover asdigital platforms keep clients engaged and
        client-initiated transactions increase.<br/><br/>
        What is our outlook?<br/><br/>
        We have increased our DBS ROE expectation for FY18e from previous estimate of 12.1% to13.1% as the economies in
        DBS¡¯ main markets of Hong Kong and Singapore remain vibrant.In particular, Singapore 3Q GDP growth surpassed
        expectations with a 5.2% increase YoY.Our revised ROE estimate is due to our expectation that the strong economy
        continues tobe supportive of stronger pass-through of higher interest rates. As a result we increasedour FY18e
        total income estimate by 4.5% and PATMI estimate by 8.4%. The high doubledigit growth in FY18e PATMI is mainly
        due to absence of lumpy provision expense in FY17<br/><br/>
