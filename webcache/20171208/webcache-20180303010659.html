    <p> As the S&amp;P; 500 (-0.11%) reversed strong gains from the opening (+0.87% atthe day¡¯s early highs), its¡¯ been
        noticeable that there has been a distinct sectorrotation over the last week which is impacting the momentum of
        the market. TheNASDAQ fell -1.05% yesterday and more recently, the ¡®FANG¡¯ names have soldoff -5.61% in last 5
        sessions and were -1.83% lower yesterday. Within the S&amp;P;,the IT sector fell -1.93% and has fallen -3.9%
        over the same 5 days and is at c5week lows. Meanwhile Telecoms (+1.60%) and US Financials (+1.55%) were thestar
        performers yesterday and are now up 7.99% and 6.84% respectively over thelast 5 days. For Financials the rally
        seemed to coincide with incoming Fed ChairMr Powell confirming his belief that bank regulation shouldn¡¯t go any
        further andalso with momentum building that the tax reform package would pass the senate.<br/><br/>
        The sector is at the highest level since October 2007. Elsewhere, Telcos were seenas big beneficiaries from
        proposed corporate tax cuts. So there¡¯s a fair bit goingon internally in US equities at the moment.</p>
