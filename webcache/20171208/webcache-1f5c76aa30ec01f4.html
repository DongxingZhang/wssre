    <p> On 1Dec 17, the US FDA had approved the first biosimilar ofHerceptin, Ogivri?, for breast and stomach cancer
        therapy. Developedby Mylan and Biocon, we see Ogivri can now tap into the globalHerceptin sales of over
        USD6.5bn. We estimate Herceptin biosimilarmarket in China to be RMB16bn. Should 3SBio (1530.HK, BUY,TP:HKD22.00)
        receive its Herceptin biosimilar (»¸∆’Õ°) approval byend-2Q18, it will add another 24% upside from our TP. On
        ourforecast, this would be worth HKD15bn or HKD5.20/ 3SBio share.<br/><br/>
        US FDA approved the first biosimilar of Herceptin in US.<br/><br/>
        On 1Dec 2017, the US FDA had approved the first biosimilar of Herceptin(trastuzumab), Ogivri? for the treatment
        of patients with breast or metastaticstomach cancer, whose tumours over-express the HER2gene. Jointly developed
        byMylan and Biocon, we see Ogivri can now tap into the global Herceptin sales ofover USD6.5bn (RMB43bn), based
        on the figures from Journal of Tumour Medicine&amp; Prevention. An article from Expert Opinion on Therapeutic
        Patents cited that thefull course of treatment with Herceptin (original drug) is over USD50,000, withabout
        USD4,500per month for each patient.<br/><br/>
        More Herceptin biosimilars awaiting for approvals.<br/><br/>
        Earlier, South Korea°Øs Celltrion joined hands with Teva Pharma to co-develop abiosimilar of Herceptin, with a
        trade name Herzuma? (CT-P6). It has been acceptedby US FDA for the Biologics License Application review. On
        20Nov 2017, therelevant authority of European Commission has granted the market and regulatoryapproval for the
        biosimilar of Herceptin, known as Ontruzant?, by Samsung Bioepis.In China, Shanghai Henlius Biotech ∏¥∫Í∫∫¡ÿ (a JV
        with Fosun Pharm (2196.HK, NR)and Henlius Biopharm) has had its biosimilar of Herceptin already on Phase
        IIIclinical trial. Other Chinese drug-makers which had its Herceptin°Øs biosimilar onPhase III clinical trials
        include Genor Biopharma (ºŒ∫Õ…˙ŒÔ) and another listedbiotech player.<br/><br/>
        China°Øs Herceptin biosimilars market worth RMB16bn.<br/><br/>
        In 2015, China°Øs number of new cases for breast/ stomach cancer patients were268,600and 679,100, expecting them
        to reach 296,132and 748,708new cases in2017with 5% growth each year. The usual dosage of Herceptin involves a
        loadingdose of 8mg/kg weight of a patient for a week, followed by another seventeenweeks of dosage at 6mg/kg
        each week. The lowest and highest tender prices forHerceptin from Roche are RMB7,600and RMB22,492per 440mg
        (20ml) vial inGuangxi and Guizhou Provinces respectively. Should we assume the<br/><br/>
        (1) pricing ofHerceptin°Øs biosimilar to be 70% to that of the mean value of Roche°Øs originalversion (~RMB10,532/
        0.44g) and<br/><br/>
        (2) penetration rate of Herceptin°Øs biosimilars at25%/15% in China for breast and stomach cancers, this market
        potential in 2017for breast and stomach cancers would be RMB6.5bn and RMB9.9bn respectively.<br/><br/>
        3SBio°Øs Herceptin biosimilar to add 24% more upside from TP<br/><br/>
        On our forecast in 3SBio (1530.HK, BUY, TP:HKD22.00), we expect its biosimilar ofHerceptin (»¸∆’Õ°) to receive its
        China approval by end-2Q18, valuing it (using 10-year DCF) to be worth HKD15.1bn or HKD5.20per 3SBio share. This
        will addanother 24% upside from our TP. Despite of not having included in our TP, ourHerceptin°Øs biosimilar
        valuation is based on FY19F-20F assumptions for<br/><br/>
        (1) sellingprice at RMB8,600/RMB8,471per unit;<br/><br/>
        (2) initial sales value at RMB50m/100m(sales CAGR (FY19F-22F) at 108%) and<br/><br/>
        (3) gross margin at 85%/84%.</p>
