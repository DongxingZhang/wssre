    <p> The outlook is positive. Earnings growth in the pipeline to come from the Jurong IslandContainer Depot (JICD)
        project and to a lesser extent, the student hostel at 362HollandRoad. As described in our previous report, it is
        inevitable that Cogent becomesconsolidated as a subsidiary of COSCO SHIPPING International (Singapore) Co.
        Ltd.(COSCO). Thereafter, potentially benefiting from COSCO¡¯s intention to develop Cogent intoa regional
        logistics player.<br/><br/>
        Reject the Offer; take partial profit and hold out for a failed delisting<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our $1.12valuation for Cogent, which is 10% higher than the Offer Price. Asoutlined in our previous
        report, the Offer Price of $1.02is uncompelling, in our view. TheOffer Price for Cogent is only 14.9x
        price-to-trailing-earnings, whereas the Offer Price forarguably Cogent's closest peer, Poh Tiong Choon Logistics
        Ltd, was at a much higher priceto-trailing-earnings multiple of 23.0x. Our recommendation remains unchanged ¨C
        minorityshareholders should take partial profit to avoid tying up capital while the Offer remainsopen and to
        Reject the Offer.<br/><br/>
        The remaining capital invested in Cogent will resemble a call option. If the delisting issuccessful, minority
        shareholders will receive $1.02anyway. If the delisting fails, minorityshareholders will remain shareholders of
        Cogent, a listed-subsidiary of COSCO.</p>
