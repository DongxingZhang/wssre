    <p> The Chinese economy is likely to slow in the fourth quarter as a result of deleveragingin old-economy industries
        and strengthening in financial supervisionfollowing the establish of the State Council Financial Stability and
        DevelopmentCommittee. The decline in China¡¯s stock markets in November may be a sign of anupcoming economic
        slowdown. The rise in China¡¯s 10-year sovereign bond yield and3-month SHIBOR rates suggesting China has
        tightened its monetary policy amidfurther U.S. rate hike in December. This may cap the upside for stock markets
        inboth China and Hong Kong in near term. However, there is a continuous inflow ofcapital from China via Shanghai
        and Shenzhen Stock Connects that helps reduce therisk of a sharp correction on Hong Kong equities. We therefore
        take a neutral viewon Hong Kong¡¯s stock market in December with a trading range of 28,600-29,800 forthe Hang
        Seng Index.</p>
