    <p> 9MFY17 profit down 53% y©\y: Profit in the first nine months of the year contracted 53% y©\ydespite a 31% rise in
        revenue. The profit slide was due mainly to overseas investmentsthrough acquisitions of cement assets in the
        Asia©\Pacific region which even though boostedSCCC¡¯s total production capacity by 70%, they pushed interest
        expenses sharply higher by89% y©\y, weighing heavily on profit in the face of a drop in cement selling prices,
        notably inThailand. In this period, SCCC also recorded one©\time extra charges of as high as Bt600mnwhich pulled
        EBITDA down by 3% y©\y. 4QFY17 marks the low season for the business butthere is no longer extra©\item. We
        forecast 2HFY17 will be better than 1HFY16 and full©\yearprofit will tumble 46% y©\y.<br/><br/>
        FY18 profit expected to grow from low base effect in FY17: In our view, since SCCC took astake in Vietnam©\based
        Holcim, a Vietnamese supplier of cement and ready©\mix, in FY17, itsFY18 operating results will be let off the
        hook from the Bt600mn extra charges while cementbusiness will receive a boost from revenue contribution from
        Holcim¡¯s full©\year capacityutilization rate. For FY18, we forecast profit will jump 67% and EBITDA margin will
        improvedue to the absence of the above extra charges. We expect domestic demand for cement willgrow a mere 2©\3%
        y©\y and total revenue will increase by 6% y©\y. However, the upward trendin coal prices in FY17 will drive its
        coal costs higher and in turn drag gross margin down afterSCCC made a coal forward contract for using in
        FY18.<br/><br/>
        SCCC stock seen with some but limited upside: At current levels, SCCC has some but limitedupside and a dividend
        yield of only 3%. We lift our rating on SCCC shares from ¡®SELL¡¯ to¡®NEUTRAL¡¯ with a DCF©\based target price of
        Bt280/share as SCCC will reap the benefits fromits investment in Vietnam.</p>
