    <p> Commentary for Tuesday: This week's holiday-shortened data docket is relativelylight. There are no Fed speeches
        scheduled and the recently-passed continuingresolution keeps the government funded until January 19th. Congress
        will beon recess until January 3, when they will resume work on a FY2018 spendingpackage. While tax reform has
        been officially signed into law, there remainssignificant uncertainty with respect to the outlook for government
        expenditures.<br/><br/>
        Indeed, if Republican requests for a roughly $60 billion increase in defenseexpenditures are met with similar
        gains in nondefense, which Democrats willlikely demand, there may be significant upside risk to our 2018 real
        GDPforecast of 2.3% (Q4/Q4).<br/><br/>
        The data releases kick off Wednesday with December consumer confidence(131.0 forecast vs. 129.5 previously)
        which we expect to edge higher due to ahealthy labor market and sturdy consumer spending. Anticipation of tax
        reformmight also provide a mild lift, although the polling data are mixed in this regard.<br/><br/>
        We will also get November pending home sales (1.0% vs. 3.5%) alongside theconfidence report. Pending sales lead
        existing by a month, hence further gains inthe former would be a clear positive for the latter, which have been
        persistentlyhampered by a dearth of supply. Recall that in October, pending home sales wereup only 1.2% compared
        a year ago. Last month, the seasonally-adjusted numberof single-family homes available for sale stood at a
        23-year low according to theNational Association of Realtors. Thus, a pick up in pending home sales wouldbe a
        welcomed development.<br/><br/>
        Thursday¡¯s advance goods trade balance (-$68.5 billion vs. -$68.3 billion) forNovember will sharpen expectations
        for current quarter real GDP, which wecontinue to expect will expand by 2.8% (annualized). We anticipate
        furtherdeterioration in the trade balance given the preliminary port statistics availaiblefor November, which
        showed inbound containers outpacing outbound. Notealso that oil exports surged in October, posting the largest
        one-month gain inthe history of the series, thus we anticipate some payback in November. To besure, the recent
        widening of the trade balance will drag on growth this quarter.<br/><br/>
        However, solid gains in shipments of core durable goods point to another robust gain in equipment spending,
        which should more than offset the drag from netexports.<br/><br/>
        The December Chicago PMI (64.0 vs. 63.9), also released on Thursday, shouldprovide further evidence of robust
        manufacturing activity¡ªanother tailwind forcapital expenditures. The Chicago data will also anchor expectations
        for themanufacturing ISM, released on January 3. Given the steady performance in theISM-adjusted Philadelphia
        and New York Fed regional PMIs, another elevatedChicago print should point to a modest improvement in next
        week's ISM series.<br/><br/>
        In summary, this week's data should largely confirm that the economy hasmeaningful momentum going into 2018,
        which is one reason why we think theFed will hike four times next year, one more than policymakers' current
        medianforecast of as of the December 13 FOMC meeting.</p>
