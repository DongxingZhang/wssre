    <p> We had a conference call with Haichang Ocean Park¡¯s management this week to discuss the company¡¯slatest
        developments. We note the construction of its flagship park in Shanghai is on schedule. Inaddition, the firm¡¯s
        headquarters officially moved to Shanghai on 5 December, in preparation for theopening of the new flagship park
        in August 2018. Given the solid performance of existing parks and thesmooth development of Haichang¡¯s Shanghai
        park, we maintain our EPS forecasts of Rmb0.06 in 17E(+20.0% YoY), Rmb0.08 in 18E (+33.3% YoY), and Rmb0.10 in
        19E (+25.0% YoY). Our target price isunchanged at HK$2.35. With 39.9% upside, we maintain our BUY
        recommendation.<br/><br/>
        Solid performance among existing parks. The firm¡¯s cooperation with ¡°Where Are We Going, Dad?¡± TVshow (fifth
        season) during the Golden Week and evening show additions in parks, including TianjinPark, contribute to the
        solid growth of the company¡¯s eight existing parks, for which we expect lowteensrevenue increase in 2H17E. The
        two newly added ¡°Jellyfish world¡± exhibitions in Chengdu andTianjin parks had a positive contribution to
        non-ticket sales. We note non-ticket sales contributed 20-30% of total revenue in existing parks, with
        southwestern parks recording a higher averagecontribution (c.30%), thanks to a larger proportion of individual
        visitors, compared with northeasternparks (c.20%), which had more group visitations.<br/><br/>
        Flagship park in Shanghai on schedule. Shanghai Disneyland attracted 11m visitors during its first yearof
        operation, in line with industry expectations. The average spending per visitor reached c.Rmb600,with c.40%
        coming from non-ticket sales. Our previous forecasts of 2.8m visitors (25% of Disneyland¡¯stotal visitation) and
        non-ticket sales contribution of less than 20% were very conservative. Therefore,we expect the park alone to
        contribute more than 20% of the firm¡¯s total revenue for the full year.<br/><br/>
        According to management, the progress of the company¡¯s flagship park in Shanghai is on schedule andthe park is
        expected to open in August 2018. We forecast the new park¡¯s five-month operation in 18Ewill contribute at least
        10% of total revenue and c.8.3% of parks¡¯ total gross profit.<br/><br/>
        Growing asset-light business. Thanks to new contracts signed this year and revenue recognition, weexpect the
        firm¡¯s asset-light business to experience 30%-plus YoY increase in revenue (higher than ourprevious forecast),
        on the back of the company¡¯s marine park management experience.<br/><br/>
        Maintain BUY. Given the solid performance of existing parks and the smooth development ofHaichang¡¯s Shanghai
        park, we maintain our EPS forecasts of Rmb0.06 in 17E (+20.0% YoY), Rmb0.08 in18E (+33.3% YoY), and Rmb0.10 in
        19E (+25.0% YoY). Our target price is unchanged at HK$2.35. With39.9% upside, we maintain our BUY
        recommendation.</p>
