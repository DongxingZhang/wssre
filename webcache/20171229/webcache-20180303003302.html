    <p> Our top FX trades for 2018<br/><br/>
        We recently published our Top Macro Trades for 2018, organized across five keythemes. By theme, our key FX
        trades are: 1) Room to grow (long BRL and CLP versusshort JPY and USD); 2) Gradual policy normalization (short
        EUR/NOK and EUR/SEKvolatility); 3) European growth is broadening (long CZK and PLN versus short CHF andUSD); 4)
        China rebalancing (long NZD versus short TWD); and 5) Having our cake andeating it too (long USD/CAD).<br/><br/>
        Trade #1: Long BRL and CLP versus short JPY and USD<br/><br/>
        Our analysis shows that BRL and CLP are likely to perform well in an environment ofbroadening global growth.
        Both trade cheap versus our estimates of fair value despiteimproving fundamentals and tailwinds from key
        commodities. We split the funding ofthis position between USD and JPY. We see limited impact of incremental Fed
        hikes onthe USD, and a slow-moving BoJ should lead to further JPY weakness.<br/><br/>
        Trade #2: Short EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK vol<br/><br/>
        Although FX vol is generally low, there are still opportunities to sell it. NOK and SEK areprime examples due to
        the increased importance of FX for inflation (and by extensionpolicy) in small open economies. This makes large
        moves in such currencies difficult, ascurrency strength (or weakness) lowers (or raises) inflation quickly, thus
        working againstthe original rationale for the currency move. EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK are good places totrade this
        dynamic with recent moves offering good entry points.<br/><br/>
        Trade #3: Long CZK and PLN versus short CHF and USD<br/><br/>
        With significant trade linkages to the Euro area, CZK and PLN should continue tobenefit from broadening Euro
        area growth. Funding half of the position in dollarsmakes the trade higher beta to EUR/USD, on which we remain
        positive. The same goesfor the other half versus CHF, which should continue to depreciate versus EUR
        asinvestment outflows from Switzerland pick-up and the SNB continues to shadow theECB.<br/><br/>
        Trade #4: Long NZD versus short TWD<br/><br/>
        The rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from investment-led growth andtowards increased consumption should
        benefit exporters of consumption goods, suchas New Zealand, at the expense of investment goods exporters, such
        as Taiwan. Theentry level for NZD is attractive following the recent sell-off.<br/><br/>
        Trade #5: Long USD/CAD<br/><br/>
        Long USD/CAD should work well not only as an outright view but also as a hedge tothe pro-risk/carry trades
        presented above. According to our fair value framework, CADscreens as expensive and markets likely overprice BoC
        tightening against weak inflationdynamics and moderating growth. In addition, short CAD is likely to perform
        well in abroad risk-off scenario due to the currency's commodity links and reliance on capitalflows to finance
        Canada's current account deficit.<br/><br/>
        EM: Focussing on idiosyncratic opportunities<br/><br/>
        Even as the secular tailwinds driving EM gains ¨C accelerating China and global tradevolume growth, rising
        commodity prices and a weak USD ¨C have lost momentum,benign global growth should keep volatility suppressed. We
        are focussing onidiosyncratic opportunities where credit risks appear mispriced or central bank
        reactionfunctions may be changing. We have structural longs in the RUB, BRL, SGD, CZK andPLN. The TRY is worth
        watching closely this month as a tactical positive opportunity.</p>
