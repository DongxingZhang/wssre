    <p> The Shanghai Composite has crossed below its 9- and 12- month MA¡¯s but notdecisively so. However, other
        indicators, such as our monthly diffusion series andthe 1/180 price oscillator, are bearish. Consequently an
        overall cautious stance isappropriate until some of these negatives can be cleared up or if the Compositecrosses
        back decisively above its 12-month MA. Sometimes after a sharp setbackwe see a change in leadership. The sharp
        improvement in relative action suggeststhat Chinext could perform that role, as it has started to rally above a
        key downtrendline reflecting relative action.</p>
