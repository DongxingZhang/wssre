    <p> Putting prices in context.<br/><br/>
        Brent prices have broken out above the USD 65/bbl equilibrium level. With ourmarket model balanced (neutral) in
        2018 and 2019, any sustained move aboveequilibrium price would appear premature. Additionally, we believe that
        pricesremaining at USD 68/bbl (WTI 62/bbl) for a significant period (6 months to 1 year)could begin to change
        the supply outlook and meaningfully dampen the modeleddeficit of -754 kb/d we expect in 2020. In the absence of
        a demand surprisethis year, we see prices eventually moving lower before recovering on a moresustainable basis
        over the medium term.<br/><br/>
        Identifying bullish drivers.<br/><br/>
        We do not find the fundamental drivers particularly compelling at first glance,but the first suspect is a
        carryover effect from December pipeline outages inLibya, the North Sea, and Canada. Even severe outages such as
        Forties (417 kb/d) have a limited effect on the 2018 model because of their short duration (3weeks). However we
        allow that concerns over the possibility of a longer outage atForties could be helping Brent prices. A second
        factor is the larger-than-expecteddecline in US crude oil inventory in December. Key drivers behind this are
        astrong recovery in refinery utilisation to 96.7% and 8-wk average demand growthpeaking at +463 kb/d yoy on 20
        December. However, one might have expectedUS strength to also be accompanied by a narrowing of the WTI-Brent
        differential.<br/><br/>
        Since this has not occurred, it casts doubt on the US inventory story as a majordriver of the rally. Yet more
        difficult to ascertain is what increased risk premium,if any, the market may attach to political protests in
        Iran.<br/><br/>
        Fundamental framework upended.<br/><br/>
        The lack of clear fundamental drivers raises questions about the typicalcommodity cycle framework and may mean
        that other factors such as USDweakness since mid-December may also be playing a role. The typical frameworkwould
        hold that prices move above the mid-cycle equilibrium price only in theevent of meaningful supply-demand
        deficits. As evidence, we point to the lastdecade. Between 2006 and 2013, the market averaged a -500 kb/d
        deficit, andBrent prices averaged USD 89/bbl. From 2014-2016, the market averaged a +1.1mmb/d surplus, and Brent
        prices retreated from USD 99/bbl in 2014 to an averageof USD 49/bbl in 2015-16. Over the 2017-2019 period we
        expect an average of a+95 kb/d surplus ¨C in other words, nearly balanced markets. Until now, persistentinventory
        excesses from the 2014-16 downcycle have lent a negative bias toprices, i.e., below equilibrium, but that bias
        may now be fading, thus leaving thestate of market balance (neutral) as the dominant factor.</p>
