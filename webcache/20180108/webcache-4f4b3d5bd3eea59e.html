    <p> In 2017, leading drug manufacturers were re-rated significantly while small-medium drug manufacturers,
        distributors, device manufacturers and hospitals all underperformed. Looking ahead, we should continue to see
        opportunities and challenges in 2018. Opportunities include (i) national medical insurance payment method
        reform, which is expected to benefit innovative and clinically indispensable drugs, (ii) approval of new drugs,
        (iii) consistency assessment completion of the chemical quality and efficacy of generics that calls for generics
        consolidation, and (iv) completion of the two-invoice system by end-2018, which will benefit the leading
        distributors in the long run. Also, M&amp;A; and overseas new drug applications/approvals (U.S. ANDA) should
        provide new growth engines for pharmaceutical companies. Challenges include potential RMB depreciation,
        continued tender price cuts, expensive BE tests, the removal of the 15% price mark-up for drugs (ex-CTCM), and
        medical insurance cost controls, which could cut into the sales growth and margins of pharmaceutical
        companies.<br/><br/>
        On this basis, our two key directions for stock picks in 2018 are 1) the expectation that leading innovative
        drug manufacturers will continue outperform; and 2) catch-up opportunities for value investment in quality large
        caps in some sub-segments.<br/><br/>
        1) CTCM [0570.HK; BUY]: (i) attractive valuation; (ii) strong growth expected from CCMG business; (iii) the
        potential of introducing a strategic investor to remove concern about a potential share disposal by
        ex-management.<br/><br/>
        2) Sinopharm [1099.HK; initiate with BUY]: (i) bottoming-out in 2018; (ii) historically low valuation; (iii)
        promising retail and high margin medical device distribution business development.<br/><br/>
        3) CSPC [1093.HK; BUY]: (i) strong R&amp;D; capability; (ii) expected launch of Paclitaxel-albumin; (iii)
        premium execution that consistently delivers results; (iv) strong cash flow from the Vitamin C business as a
        cash cow; (v) continued re-rating given investors¡¯ limited alternatives for tracing healthcare industry
        consolidation opportunities.</p>
