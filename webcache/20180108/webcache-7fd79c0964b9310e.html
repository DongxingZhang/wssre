    <p> Based on our mobile tracker, we estimate 4Q17 mobile revenues to go up by4-5% QoQ (~100% YoY), in line with our
        forecast. We think the variability inoutlook resides with the relative strength of YingYongBao (MyApp) as well
        asthe assumption of QoQ flattish Honor of Kings (HoK). We have observed overallranking improvement in various
        titles in 4Q, for example Naruto and LandlordPoker. Despite the natural decay of Legacy TLBB (-19% QoQ) and
        Contra Mobile(-11% QoQ), we have seen unexpected success in other major titles. JX Mobilewas renamed New JX
        mobile with new features on October 26th and climbedback to the top 10 basket, a well-timed reinvigoration.
        Strategy genre is generallynot well received by Chinese audience, however King of Chaos has maintainedand
        improved its ranking in the top 10 basket since August launch. Our estimatedgross billing for King of Chaos has
        increased 81% QoQ due to improved rankingand full quarter effect. Our tracker assumed flat gross billing QoQ for
        HoK butwe do notice the deterioration in user base since 3Q17 as observed by bothQuestMobile and Analysys, the
        magnitude of revenue decline depends on theproportion of paying users lost.<br/><br/>
        Separately, QQ Speed Mobile has been ranked #2 since its launch on December27th , we are optimistic on its
        robustness giving strong social feature and lightcompetitiveness. Sandbox survival game Glorious Mission had a
        soft launch onOctober 29, we have yet to see any monetization. Two more official PUBG mobilegames are on their
        way developed by separate Tencent studios, we are expectinglaunches in 1Q18.</p>
