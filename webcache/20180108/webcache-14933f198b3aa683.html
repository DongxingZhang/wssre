    <p> ¡°Capacity reduction¡±restricts nuclear power capacityfromgrowingat anexplosive rate.China¡¯s nuclear power
        capacityaddition eased substantially in 2017, withmerely 2,175MWadded for the year, accounting for only 30% of
        the 7,205MW of addition in 2016. In our view, the supply-side structuralreform (the Reform) in 2017 was one of
        the key reasons forthe slowdown, considering the existing oversupply situation in China¡¯s power industry. In
        2018, against the backdrop of the intensified efforts in the Reform, which was emphasised in the 19thCongress
        Party, we estimate nuclear power capacity will continue to grow by 2-4GWper annum in the foreseeable
        future.<br/><br/>
        The commencementof Generation III+ reactors¡¯ commercial operationis uncertain. It is worthyto note that majority
        of CNG (1816.HK, BUY, TP:HKD2.60) and China Nuclear¡¯s(601985.HK, NR) new nuclear reactors, which are currently
        experiencing construction delays, are of the so-called¡°Generation III+¡±that have not been put into commercial
        operation on a global basis. Moreover, based on our estimate, the Generation III+reactors account for 62% of the
        new capacity to be added during2018-2020, and once the greenlightis given, nuclear power capacity will
        resumerapid growth, which defeats the government¡¯s purpose of capacity reduction.<br/><br/>
        Nuclear power is still the preferred clean and sustainable energyof the Chinese government. We estimate nuclear
        power¡¯s share inChina¡¯s total power generation volume will expand to 4.25% in 2018 from3.95% in 2017E,
        representing 8 years of consecutive growth, in line with the government¡¯s target ofraisingthe share of clean
        energy in total power consumption. Against this backdrop, nuclear power generation is estimated to increase by
        12.4% YoY in 2018, albeit slowervs. +18.0% YoY in 2017Emainly due to the higher comparison base.<br/><br/>
        Competitiveness in on-grid tariff and fueling cost. In the clean energy space, the nuclear power¡¯s on-grid
        tariff is c.30%, 40% and 50% cheaper than wind, gas and solar powerrespectively. Moreover, the sustainability of
        nuclear poweras an energy source makes it more suitable for industrial consumers. In addition, nuclear power has
        an absoluteadvantageover other energy sourcesinterms offuelcost, accounting for c.20% and 30% of the unit cost
        of gas and coal-fired powerrespectively, especially amid the current high gas and coal prices. Stock pick.We
        recommend CGN Power (1816.HK, BUY, TP: HKD2.60) in the nuclear power sector, on expectation thatthe company¡¯s
        EPS (excluding one-offs) will grow by 37% and 10% YoY in FY17Eand FY18Erespectively, on the back of the
        company¡¯ssteady on-grid power volume growth. In addition, as capital expenditure is likely to come down along
        with slowdown in new capacity addition, the company is expected to resume positive free cash flowin 2018,it will
        be in a financially sound position to increase its dividend payout ratio going forward. The company is currently
        trading at FY17E/FY18E PBR of 1.3x/1.2x versusFY17E/FY18E ROE of 16.0%/15.6% respectively, which we deem
        undervalued.</p>
