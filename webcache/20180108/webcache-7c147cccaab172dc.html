    <p> Entering secular growth cycle<br/><br/>
        After Wuliangye's 130% share price hike in past 12month, market has increasingconcerns on whether there is still
        upside. Our view is positive. We expect thecompany to enter a secular growth period in 2018-19, and its earnings
        to growat 29% CAGR in 2018-20, driven by management¡¯s strong incentives for growthand expanding high end liquor
        market after Moutai raising price. We revise upour target price to Rmb98, implying 27x 2018P/E. We reiterate
        Buy.<br/><br/>
        Management has strong incentive to drive sales and improve efficiency<br/><br/>
        During 1218distributor meeting, Wuliangye management indicates to achievegross sales of Rmb40bn in 2018and
        Rmb60bn in 2020(vs Rmb30bn in 2017E).Management will invest in channel penetration, brand building and
        productsstreamlining to drive sales growth. Helped by completion of management sharesincentive schemes and
        strong support from Wuliangye group, we believe thecompany could achieve its target.<br/><br/>
        Moutai¡¯s price hike to release more market for Wuliangye<br/><br/>
        On Dec 29, Moutai announced to raise ex-factory price by 18% to Rmb969/bottle,and set retail price at
        Rmb1499/bottle. As a result, the ex-factory price gap ofMoutai over Wuliangye expands from 10% to 30%. We
        believe Wuliangye is thebiggest beneficiary of the price hike, helped by the expanding high end liquormarket
        room released by Moutai.<br/><br/>
        We reiterate Buy; revising up TP to Rmb98<br/><br/>
        We are revising up our earnings forecast by 13%-42% for 2018-2020to factor in abetter volume growth, mix
        upgrade, and margin expansion, and revise up targetprice by 40% to Rmb98based on DCF model. We are changing our
        valuationmethodology from EV/EBITDA to DCF as we believe DCF model can incorporatelong-term growth and solid
        cash flow. Downside risk: channel de-stocking inhigh-end liquor sector; food safety; worse than expected macro
        FAI slow down.</p>
