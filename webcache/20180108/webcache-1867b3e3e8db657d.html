    <p> Box office collection in 2017 was RMB55.8bn, increasing by 23% yoy (vs.<br/><br/>
        RMB45.5bn in 2016). If we exclude ticket handling fees (c.6% of total box office),total box office in 2017
        increased by 15% to RMB52.4bn, which is in line with ourestimates for the same time last year. We believe this
        is mainly due to a strongHollywood movie performance in 1H17 and surprising "Black horse" Chinesemovies in 2H17,
        such as Wolf Warriors 2 and Never Say Die. Longer term, we areconfident that the China box office will reach
        c.RMB81bn in 2020, which impliesa CAGR of 16% from 2016 (the base year). The total number of cinemas by 2017was
        9,370. New additions of cinemas was 1,519, a yoy growth of almost 20%.<br/><br/>
        We have seen total incremental movie screens of 9,597, a yoy growth of 23%.<br/><br/>
        China's total movie screens is now 50k.<br/><br/>
        Chinese movies (c.11% yoy growth) contributed c.57% (vs. 58% in2016) of China¡¯s total box office in 2017,
        recovering from less than30% contribution in 1H17. This was mainly driven by the more thanRMB7bn in box office
        generation from Wolf Warriors 2 (a record-breakingRMB5.68bn) and Never Say Die (RMB2.19bn).<br/><br/>
        For foreign movies, especially from Hollywood, growth remained robust:movie box office grew c.21% yoy on a
        like-for-like basis. We believe thatthe strong performance of Hollywood movies was mainly driven by actionseries
        movies.<br/><br/>
        IMAX reported 4Q17 (as of Dec 24) box office of USD56.3m in GreaterChina. As of Dec 24, IMAX 2017 box office
