    <p> Our new issue thoughts on SWIPRO and relative value<br/><br/>
        According to Bloomberg, the proposed Swire Properties USD 10-year greenbond has an IPT of +130bp area. We see
        the fair value for the new 10-yearUSD bonds at G+110-115bp (without factoring new issue concession). Theproposed
        bonds are for funding or refinancing of new and existing eligiblegreen projects and are expected to have A2/A
        rating from Moody¡¯s/Fitch.There are only a handful of similarly rated issuers in the HK and China
        space,including Hongkong Land (HKLSP 4.5% 2025s, ask price: 108.9, G+79bp, issuerating A2/A/A) and China State
        Construction Engineering Corp (CHCONS 3.5%2027s, ask price: 98.7, G+121bp, issue rating A2/A/A). Given our
        expectation ofheavy supply from China and generally strong corporate governance of HKnames, we continue to
        expect China single A comps to trade about 10-15bpwider than Hong Kong single A rated names. Within HK IG space,
        SwireProperties has the same issuer rating as CKHH from Moody¡¯s and one-notchhigher rating from Fitch, with its
        bonds trading slightly wider than CKHHhistorically. CKHH 3.25% 2027s (Hold rating) trade at ask price of
        97.8,G+106bp. We think SWIPRO should trade about 5-7bp wider than CKHH forthe same maturity, due to its smaller
        scale and less diversified business in spiteof better margins vs. CKHH. Thus, we see the fair value of the
        proposedSWIPRO USD 10-year bonds at ask G-spread of about +110-115bp. Comparedto its own curve, SWIPRO 3.625%
        Jan 2026s (Hold rating) trade at ask price101.4, YTM: 3.4%, G+101bp. Assuming around 5-7bp per year of
        extensionwould also put our fair value of SWIPRO¡¯s new 10-year at around G+110-115bp. Key downside risks include
        sharp drop in HK property prices and/orrents and weak market technicals, while upside risks include
        stronger-thanexpectedrecurrent income and slower-than-expected rate hike.<br/><br/>
        Good property portfolio<br/><br/>
        As of end-June, 2017, Swire Properties possessed 29.3mn sq ft of attributableproperty, of which 26.6mn sq ft was
        attributable investment property (of which57% was located in Hong Kong, 33% in Mainland China and 10% in USA
        andelsewhere) while 2.7mn sq ft was attributable trading property portfolio (ofwhich 0.1mn sq ft was in HK,
        0.3mn sq ft was in China, and 2.3mn sq ft was inthe USA). We see SWIPRO¡¯s property portfolio as good. It also
        has a strongbrand name in decentralized commercial and office property, and luxuryresidential in Hong Kong. In
        its interim 2017results briefing, SWIPROmanagement had indicated that it would like to do more projects in Hong
        Kong,including office, retail and/or residential. Outside of HK and China, its Asiaproperty exposure includes
        Singapore and Jakarta and management continuesto explore opportunities in Jakarta. As the company pointed out in
        its interimresults, it already signed an MOU for a Qiantan retail project in Shanghai.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentals<br/><br/>
        Our calculated total debt/LTM EBITDA was 3.2x at end-June, 2017, registeringan improvement vs. the 3.8x at
        end-2016. SWIPRO posted robust growth in itsChina rental income in 1H17. With SWIRPRO¡¯s HK One Taikoo Place
        plannedfor completion in 2018and more tenants moving into HKRI Taikoo HuiShanghai in 2H17and 2018, we expect the
        company¡¯s recurrent income tofurther grow in 2018. Overall, we expect its credit rating to stay stable in 2018.
