    <p> We expect MSCI China/HSCEI to extend their gains in 2018, in view of 1) a decent earningsoutlook (MSCI China EPS
        +17.0%/15.5% in 2018/19E) on secular and cyclical drivers, 2)expansion in multiples (narrowing the gap with DM)
        on a reduced risk discount, and 3) favorableliquidity conditions. Although GDP growth is likely to moderate, the
        economy shoulddemonstrate resilience and deliver better quality growth. We recommend investors to focus onthe
        G.A.R.P investment themes for 2018, i.e. Greening (environment), Advancing(manufacturing), Reforming (SOE), and
        Premiumizing (consumption).</p>
