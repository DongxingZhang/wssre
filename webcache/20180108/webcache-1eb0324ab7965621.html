    <p> A series of new retail initiatives roll out<br/><br/>
        Yonghui rolled out a series of initiatives internally and externally over the pasttwo months. We regard these
        moves as farsighted preparation for the new era ofthe retail market. We also believe that its solid offline
        merchandising capabilitiesemployed by new technology and new business models will potentially createnew growth
        drivers for Yonghui. We lift our target price by 4% to RMB10.5afterfactoring in the Hongqi stake that it
        acquired in December.<br/><br/>
        Seeking online strategic partner and soliciting offline resources<br/><br/>
        Yonghui announced Tencent's investment in December. This surprised the marketalong with Tencent's partnership
        with Vipshop. We believe Tencent is an idealpartner for Yonghui as Yonghui should have more flexibility and
        independence,given that Tencent is not a retailer by nature. Yonghui should benefit from itsonline traffic and
        increase its online capability.<br/><br/>
        More recently, it teamed up with Hongqi chain, a regional offline chain, by takinga 21% stake in the company. In
        addition, YH, Hongqi and CMIG Futurelife (aproperty management company in West China) signed a strategic
        agreement totap into a community retail network. We believe this regional corporation shouldboost its growth in
        the Southwest market where it has a solid track record.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We factor this deal into our model and derive a new RMB10.5target price (vs.RMB10.14). Our primary valuation
        methodology is DCF, employing 9.5% COE,1.0beta and a 1.5% TGR, which is in line with the 1-2.5% range we apply
        to theconsumer sector. Downside risks: 1) failure to achieve its three-year plan; 2) M&amp;Acapability; (having
        control as the second-largest shareholder); 3) challenges in themultichannel strategy.</p>
