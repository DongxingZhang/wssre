    <p> Another year of divergence among banks; still prefer retail-oriented banks.<br/><br/>
        China has made containing financial risks a top priority. Financial deleveragingmay last longer than expected,
        with higher market rates and more coordinatedbut tighter regulations. This may lead to moderate credit growth
        but slowerleverage build-up and hence, less financial stability risk. On the banks¡¯ assetside, we expect
        supply-side reform will be strictly followed and SOE reformmay accelerate, leading to improving corporate
        financial health. Thus, we staypositive on the Chinese bank sector. We expect wider divergence betweenretail
        banks (big-4/CMB/CRCB) and the rest, as funding strength remains thekey differentiating factor; upgrading CRCB
        to Buy ¨C top picks: BOC &amp; ABC.<br/><br/>
        Financial deleveraging: market rate hikes, new committee, tighter regulations.<br/><br/>
        In the past year, China¡¯s financial deleveraging campaign has made progress.<br/><br/>
        Yet we are probably still in the first half of the process, as M2/GDP and creditto-deposit ratios remain
        elevated. We expect monetary policy and macroprudentialpolicy to stay on the tightening side. Our rates
        strategist expects ahike total of 20-45bps in OMO rates until 2018 (note). New regulations on assetmanagement
        (note) and liquidity risks (note) will be phased in. With theFinancial Stability and Development Committee ¨C the
        new committeecoordinating financial regulators ¨C leading, more regulations are likely to befollowed. System
        wise, we expect slower credit growth, shrinking shadowbanking and less reliance on wholesale funding. Retail
        banks should benefitfrom higher rates and yield curve steepening due to solid deposit franchises.<br/><br/>
        The other smaller banks will experience ongoing funding and capital pressure.<br/><br/>
        Supply-side and SOE reforms to relieve asset quality risks.<br/><br/>
        China has pledged to deepen supply side reform. Our recent field trips showedthat local governments are
        rigorously carrying out de-capacity efforts thatrebalance supply-demand dynamics. SOE reform has also been
        accelerating,with a rising number of mixed-ownership pilot runs and notable progress inremoving social
        responsibilities. As a result, the improvement in corporatefinancial health, especially for industrial
        enterprises (22% of China¡¯s debt) andSOEs (35%), will probably be sustained in the coming quarters (note),
        albeitwith slower net profit growth. This should lead to less NPLs, rising provisionwrite-backs and reduced
        asset yield pressure given fewer ¡°evergreening¡± loans.<br/><br/>
        Our proprietary study shows that c. 8-13% of China¡¯s corporate debt wasevergreening, dropping from 9-14% in 2016
        and likely to decline further.<br/><br/>
        Valuation gap to widen; earnings forecasts, valuation, catalysts and risks.<br/><br/>
        In 2017, retail banks (big-4/CMB/CRCB) have outperformed other banks by28ppt. We re-rate further on stabilizing
        ROE. We forecast 6.5%/8.5% yoygrowth in 2018/19 vs. 4.3% yoy in 2017E. Reflecting the rollover of book valueinto
        2018E and exchange-rate adjustment, we lift TPs by 15%/8% for H/Asharebanks. We upgrade CRCB to Buy and CEB-H
        and BOCQ to Hold. Ourpecking order is: BOC/ABC/CCB/ICBC/CRCB. Catalysts include results: introductionof CCyB and
        D-SIB and Southbound inflow. For smaller banks, wemight turn positive if the PBOC starts loosening. Upside
        risks: removal orsoftened GDP target and more aggressive SOE reforms. Downside risks:disorderly deleveraging and
        property price correction.</p>
