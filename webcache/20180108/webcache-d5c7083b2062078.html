    <p> China Pulse Check: Steel ¨C Heating season production cuts showing effects; sector to seetight supply-demand
        balance in low season; earnings to remain high<br/><br/>
        We think the steel industry will see weakness in both supply and demand in Jan 2018, though a tightbalance
        should be reached as the contraction in supply will likely outpace the decline in demand. InJan, we expect steel
        prices to remain stable and iron ore prices to weaken slightly, with overallindustry earnings to remain at a
        high level. Our stock picks for Jan 2018are Fangda Special SteelTechnology, Nanjing Iron &amp; Steel, Angang
        Steel, Maanshan Iron &amp; Steel and Beijing Shougang.<br/><br/>
        Environmental: Environmental protection costs incorporated into industrial production costsfrom 2018<br/><br/>
        From 2018, the environmental tax and pollutant discharge permits will come into force, meaning thatenvironmental
        protection costs will be fully incorporated to the industrial production system. Asstrengthening pollution
        treatment has been listed among the three key tasks for well-off societydevelopment, the discharge of major
        pollutants has continued to decline significantly. Following thesteps of the power industry, non-power
        industries are likely to carry out ultra-clean facility renovationin 2018-2019; meanwhile, ongoing supply-side
        reform has increased profits for leading non-powerfirms, giving them cash to make relevant investments.</p>
