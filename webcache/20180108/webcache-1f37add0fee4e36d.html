    <p> The return of E&amp;P; and capex names. R&amp;C; prolonged peak cycle.<br/><br/>
        We enter 2018 cautiously optimistic that there will be outperformance inEnergy equities following three years of
        underperformance since the oil pricecollapse. APAC energy companies have had their fair share of pain but
        webelieve the worst is behind us and businesses have been reconfigured to workeven in a c.USD40-50/bbl oil price
        environment. As the forward curve nowmarches convincingly into backwardation, there are increasing upside risks
        to oil,underpinned by strong demand growth from emerging APAC countries and theglobal rebalancing of crude
        markets. Under rising oil, there is pressure on Chinaand India to revive their declining oil production which is
        positive for both E&amp;Pand;, particularly, capex-related companies. Widespread adoption of gas
        throughaggressive coal to gas switching programs has led to a winter gas crisis in China.<br/><br/>
        We note the timing could not have come any better for Australian LNG exportersas the market turns to a seller's
        market from a buyer's market in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Operating efficiencies and capital discipline leading to higher returns.<br/><br/>
        Between 2009 and 2014, oil prices went from USD57/bbl to USD100/bbl but ROEsfor the sector actually fell from
        14% to 11%. We believe the days of bloated costsand expensive M&amp;A; are now over. There is increasing
        evidence that a balancebetween growth and capital discipline can actually be achieved, which wouldconvince
        investors to return to the energy space. For starters, over the next fewyears cash returns to investors are set
        to return to those seen at the time of thepeak oil price levels in 2013 and 2014. FCF generation should also be
        in the bestshape it has been in its history, more than double the levels seen in 2009. Thisis all using the DB
        oil deck of USD53.4/54.5/56/bbl from 2017-2019, which isconservative compared with the Street and the current
        oil price of USD66/bbl. Onthe other hand, capex/DD&amp;A; essentially peaked in 2009 at 2.9x, falling to
        only1.0x in 2017, further proof of capital discipline in the sector in the years to come,and hence rising
        returns to shareholders.<br/><br/>
        In this outlook report, we address seven investment themes and our regional picksacross sectors and countries.
