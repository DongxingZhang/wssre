    <p> Buy on dips as new UnionPay rule likely limited impact<br/><br/>
        Dec GGR ended up only +14.6% yoy, below mkt expectations (20% yoy). AsMacau's top 2junkets are still seeing
        strong rolling in Dec, we suspect the misscame from smaller junkets who were more impacted by tighter liquidity
        towardsyear-end. Additionally, on 30Dec, China's forex regulator (SAFE) issued a newrule limiting UnionPay
        overseas ATM cash withdrawal amount to Rmb100k perperson per year, irrespective of the no. of cards own
        (previously Rmb100k percard per year). Near term, sector valuation is likely to get hit as regulatory
        risksheightened. But we are not too concerned as the most important channel formass players to get cash in Macau
        is to use UnionPay for fake purchases in localpawnshops. As this channel remains unaffected, we see limited
        impact on GGR.Reiterate our positive view on Macau where we forecast 2018GGR to grow 17%(vs consensus 12%). Top
        picks: Wynn Macau (Buy) &amp; Galaxy (Buy) given bothare market share gainers.</p>
