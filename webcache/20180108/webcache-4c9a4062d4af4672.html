    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +6.6%. Weekly loadings up 5.9%.<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 6.6% in Week#52 (ended 12/23/2017) vs. a 5.2%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 1.5%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 5.9% YoY (versus a 8.2%
        increase in the priorweek) and increased 2.9% sequentially (vs.a 0.5% decrease in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices up 1 c/gal to 23 c/gal. Propane flat at 97 c/gal.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices rose 1.0 c/gal last week to 23.1 c/gal (vs its fuel value of 19c/gal), continuing their recovery
        following the 4 c/gal decline four weeks agoon several delayed cracker projects and a robust build of ethane
        inventory.<br/><br/>
        While US ethane supply/demand fundamentals remain loose, ethane rejection,which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16,
        has declined following the September¡¯16 start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethane export facility in
        Houston.<br/><br/>
        Starting in 1H¡¯18, we expect US ethane s/d fundamentals to tighten further,driven by 600k bpd of new demand from
        the start-up of 8 greenfield ethylenecrackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens, we expect ethane to trade
        towardits historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuel value, with the premium reflectingfractionation,
        transportation and storage costs. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯18 US NaturalGas price forecast of $3.30/MMBtu, we estimate
        ethane prices will likely movetoward 32 c/gal by year-end ¡®18.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices rose 0.4 c/gal last week to 97.3 c/gal. While propaneinventories were down 4% last week to 71MM
        bbls, they are 18% and 8%below their 3 and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propaneinventories to
        decline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16 vs up 12% in ¡®15, upin ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene up 0.5 c/lb to 27.6 c/lb. Margins compress 0.4 c/lb to 12 c/lb.<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices rose 0.5 c/lb last week to 27.6 c/lb (vs the Novembercontract price of 33.25 c/lb). Spot
        deals for December ranged from 27.5 to27.75 c/lb with deals for January at 28 c/lb. Average spot ethylene
        marginscompressed 0.4 c/lb last week to 12.0 c/lb as higher production costs morethan offset higher selling
        prices.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forDecember delivery ranged from
        48.5-49.5 c/lb. December propylene contractprices settled up 1 c/lb at 50.0 c/lb for PG and 48.5 c/lb for
        chemical grade.<br/><br/>
        This follows a 1 c/lb increase in November, a 1.5 c/lb increase in October and 7c/lb increase in September. The
        10.5 c/lb, or 27%, increase in prices sinceSeptember has been driven by supply tightness due to Hurricane Harvey
        whichcaused outages at multiple US Gulf Coast olefins and refineries as well asdelaying a new propane
        dehydrogenation (PDH) unit which had beenscheduled to start up in September (but started-up two weeks ago).<br/><br/>
        3.8% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in January.<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, FPC USA¡¯s Point Comfort, TX cracker (1.7% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) and Shell Chemical¡¯s
        Norco, LA cracker (2.1% of NAethylene capacity)were offline last week due to operational upsets. In
        addition,CPChem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of NA ethylene capacity) restartedlast week after maintenance.
        For ¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethylene productionlosses of 5.1B lbs, or 6.1%, of capacity. This compares to 4.5B
        lbs, or 5.5%, ofcapacity in ¡¯16 and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.</p>
