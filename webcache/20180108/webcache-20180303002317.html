    <p> SOTP valuation to reflect valuation of its rapidly growing e-comm business.<br/><br/>
        We think 2018 will mark a narrative change for NetEase (NTES) towards ecommerce.<br/><br/>
        With e-comm (EC) division representing close to 30% of consolidatedrevenue in 2017E and likely to rise to over
        40% in 2018E to 40%, we thinkour valuation based solely on its game business is outdated and shift to
        SOTPvaluation. Shift to SOTP approach raises our target price from US$336/share toUS$380.<br/><br/>
        Three reasons why we are changing to SOTP valuation now.<br/><br/>
        1) Based on our latest conversation with management, we believe EC division mayshow another acceleration in
        growth in 4Q17 to &gt;140% yoy from 3Q17's 80%. Onthe other hand, losses may be bigger than we had previously
        envisioned. We hadEC's net profit may only be running at a small loss, but a closer diagnosis suggestsnet
        margins are at negative high single digit to low teens. Between the fact that a)NTES' EC business is only
        two-years old but growing rapidly, and b) evidence ofolder companies such as JD having shown proof that margins
        can improve withgrowing scale, we think NTES' EC business can be valued positively on top-linemetrics. 2) Lack
        of clear disclosure is one reason why it has been challenging tovalue NetEase's EC business separately, but we
        think the accounting/reportingefforts are in the works and we expect separate and clear disclosure for
        thebusiness unit in 2018. 3) NetEase's e-commerce business, represented by Kaola(cross-border EC) and Yanxuan
        (private label), commands a unique position inChina's EC landscape next to Alibaba, JD.com and Vipshop. While
        net revenuemay only be 4% of JD.com in 2017, we expect it to grow to ~7% in 2018 andcontinue to grow quickly in
        a differentiated segment from peers. With Tencent-JD-VIPS recently aligning together, we think NetEase's EC
        business now standsin a unique strategic position that may appeal to other EC companies.<br/><br/>
        Change to valuation methodology and key risks.<br/><br/>
        We are changing our valuation from a probability-weighted approach to SOTP. Wehave raised our 2018 revenue
        forecast by 8%, raising EC unit's revenue outlookby 29%. The losses associated with EC unit causes lower
        profitability and causesus to cut our non-GAAP EPS by 16%. Underlying changes to the online gamebusiness is
        minor as we retain our 22x forward P/E valuation framework. Our SOTPvaluation values online games and
        advertising at US$ 336/share at 22x forwardP/E, US$27.7/share for EC unit at 0.8x 2018 P/sales, and US$16 for
        net cash.<br/><br/>
        0.8x P/sales is similar to peers such as JD.com or Vipshop. Key downside riskis that earnings may continue to
        miss as Street may not be properly assessingthe underlying earnings and growth between the online game and
        e-commerce businesses. Subsiding euphoria around Sandbox survival genre mobile gamecould also weaken share
        price.</p>
