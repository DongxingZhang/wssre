    <p> According to Bloomberg, CITIC Limited is conducting a new senior dualtranchebond issuance denominated in USD.
        The deal will form part of CITIC¡¯sUSD9bn MTN programme. According to the source, IPG for the 5-year tranchehas
        been set at T5+150bp while for 10-year one it is T10+180bp. We expectthe total issue size to be in USD1-1.5bn
        range with the primary use ofproceeds being the refinancing of USD1.1bn bond due on 21-Jan-18.<br/><br/>
        We believe that the FV for the upcoming new 5Y and 10Y issues of CITICLimited should be ~T5+125bp and
        ~T10+155bp. We remind investors that wecurrently have a Sell recommendation on the existing CITLTD bonds due
        in2023, 2026 and 2027 that are quoted at 115.1/122bp, 98.8/144bp 99.7/147bpbid-price/G-sprd respectively. In our
        view, CITIC Ltd is arguably the only largercredit in China IG space that has a material negative fundamental
        pressure.<br/><br/>
        The company has already been downgraded by S&amp;P; to BBB+/Stable in Sep-17while Moody¡¯s maintains it on
        A3/Negative. We believe that a ratingsdowngrade by Moody¡¯s is quite likely in the next 3-6 months. CITIC
        Bankcontinues to determine CITLTD¡¯s credit profile given that it accounts for ~90%of group¡¯s assets and ~80% of
        the consolidated net income. The bank hasbeen already undergoing material de-risking given the capital
        constraints,deteriorating asset quality and drive by the government to reduce ¡°shadowbanking¡± exposures. We
        expect these pressures to remain acute in 2018. InJul-17 CBRC approved RMB40bn convertible bonds issuance for
        CNCB thathas not been completed yet. We estimate that even if these bonds were issuedand converted into equity
        today, CNCB¡¯s CET1 ratio would have improved to~9.3-9.4%, which is ~200bp below the current average for big-5
        banks inChina. The key question then is whether CNCB would pursue de-risking evenafter the issuance of CBs, or
        would it resort to debt markets to replenish itsAT1 and T2 capital buffers, further pressuring its NIM.</p>
