    <p> Washing machine: sustainably strong<br/><br/>
        QH¡¯s washing machine domestic sales saw a major acceleration in 4Q17(vs.up c. 20% in 9M17), again driven by
        lower-tier cities and Casarte. QH¡¯s 2018washing machine growth target implies a meaningful acceleration, echoing
        theaccelerating market share gain we witnessed by QH and Midea (Figure 9).<br/><br/>
        Kitchen appliances: Tier 1cities more resilient, while Tier 3&amp; 4accelerating<br/><br/>
        Robam: we forecast 4Q17sales growth to be largely in line with DBe of 24%YoY. Although growth from Tier 1cities
        has slowed down since 2H17, wewitnessed some resilience in 4Q17(up high single-digit ppt YoY, similar to thatin
        3Q17), while growth in Tier 3&amp; 4cities could have accelerated in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        Channel and logistics: penetration into lower tier cities<br/><br/>
        As suggested in our Singles¡¯ Day channel checks, air con. e-commercecontinues to accelerate in 4Q17, while W&amp;R;
        and kitchen appliances¡¯ hasdecelerated. More investments are now made in physical branded stores inTier 3&amp;
        4cities (leading to QH and Robam¡¯s strong performance, in our view).</p>
