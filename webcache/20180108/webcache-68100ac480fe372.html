    <p> Sustainable industrial growth is fuelling 2018-2020 momentum.<br/><br/>
        Despite the recent UPS raw material price rally, we still expect Kstar to post a30% YoY EPS increase in 2017 on
        rush EV charging pile pull-in from stationoperators. In 2018-2020, Kstar expects to deliver 30% EPS CAGR due to:
        1)integrated UPS data center share gains; 2) continued inverter strength fromgovernmental poverty reduction
        projects; and 3) 50%+ EV charging revenueincrease on new inland customers win (Heilongjiang provinces). We like
        Kstar¡¯sreasonable valuation (20x 18E EPS), solid balance sheet (net cash, positiveFCF), and high exposure to
        industrial applications (EV, UPS). Retain Buy.<br/><br/>
        4Q17: accelerating EV charging momentum mitigates UPS material price hike.<br/><br/>
        We had an update with Kstar on recent UPS headwinds resulting from the rawmaterial price rally (lead and copper
        price lifted ~10% in Oct-Nov). Kstar raisedits UPS pricing by 5-8% in November to pass the cost burden to its
        customers.<br/><br/>
        The company expects some short-term UPS margin impact stemming from thesudden change but maintains its 2017 EPS
        guidance of 30%+ unchangedthanks to stronger EV charging momentum. Propelled by charging stationoperators¡¯ rush
        orders in 4Q17, Kstar aims to generate RMB150m revenuefrom EV charging vs. RMB40m in 3Q17 and 4Q16. The company
        will likelysustain 40%+ GPM from EV charging business thanks to its higher powerconversion efficiency. Driven by
        EV and inverter strength, we expect Kstar topost 4Q17 EPS of RMB0.23 (+38% QoQ, +30% YoY), on revenue of
        RMB761m(+20% QoQ, +32% YoY).<br/><br/>
        Integrated UPS + EV charging strength is boosting 2018 momentum.<br/><br/>
        Kstar is confident of delivering 15-20% on-line UPS revenue CAGR in 2018-2020 driven by integrated UPS share
        gains from data center customers. Kstarstarted to offer integrated UPS solutions (combining on-line UPS,
        highprecision air conditioner and battery into the cabinet) in 2017 and has receivedstrong orders from data
        center customers. Management indicates thatintegrated UPS carries a GPM of 40%+ vs. conventional on-line UPS of
        33-35%. Kstar also expects a 100%+ YoY EV charging pile revenue increase in2018 thanks to robust order forecasts
        from charging station operators. Thecompany also targets to bid for new orders from State Power in 2H18,
        whichcould post additional upside to its aggressive EV charging guidance.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        We keep our earnings estimates largely unchanged. We lift our target price toRMB21 from RMB18.6 as we roll over
        to one year FW EPS (still based on 30xP/E multiple or 1.0x PEG, in line with Asian peer average). Risks: weaker
        ChinaUPS demand, price competition, and unfavorable FX.</p>
