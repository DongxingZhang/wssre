    <p> CRRC (1766HK, Buy): Strong 4Q17new orders; maintain Buy<br/><br/>
        CRC announced that China met its annual rail FAI target in 2017, while the 3,038km of new rail linesbrought into
        operation during the year was higher than the target of 2,100km. For 2018, CRC istargeting a rail FAI budget of
        Rmb73.2bn, which would represent an 8.5% YoY decrease. It alsoexpects: 1) 35rail projects to start construction
        in 2018, 2) 4,000km of new rail lines to be broughtinto operation, including 3,500km of high-speed rail lines.
        CRRC¡¯s management believes there couldbe a slight increase in the rail equipment budget, and sees upside to the
        new rail lines target.WuXi Biologics (2269HK, Buy): 90-day extension of ibalizumab¡¯s PDUFA date a
        short-termnegative; expect first commercial batch to be delivered in 2Q18<br/><br/>
        TaiMed Biologics announced that the FDA will extend its review of ibalizumab by 90days. We notethat its CMO
        contract manufacturing partner, WuXi Biologics, previously expected the project to entercommercialization by
        1Q18. While we believe the delay is merely a short-term setback, it will have aslightly negative impact on
        WuXi¡¯s FY18outlook. However, we see a strong likelihood of approval,and the temporary delay does not impact our
        outlook for ibalizumab. Uncertainty could lead to neartermweakness, but we expect the eventual approval and the
        prospect for commercial manufacturingto be a positive catalyst for WuXi Biologics.<br/><br/>
