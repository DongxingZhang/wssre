    <p> Trimmed VNB growth forecasts, downgrading China Life to Hold.<br/><br/>
        In our view, the easy growth enjoyed by Chinese life insurers since 2015 maybe ending, on higher deposit
        competition from banks. Given ongoingdeleveraging initiatives, 1Y WMP yields have risen, and surpassed
        averagecrediting rates offered by listed life insurers in July-17. Inevitably, this willlower the relative
        attractiveness of insurance savings products. Thus, we cutour VNB forecasts by 5% in 2H17E and 7% in 2018E. We
        D/G China Life toHold but keep our positive sector stance, on inexpensive valuations. We preferinsurers with a
        stronger protection focus and keep Ping An and NCI as our toppicks. We stay neutral on P&amp;C; as we see upward
        pressure on combined ratio.<br/><br/>
        Life: Downside risk to growth.<br/><br/>
        The relative attractiveness of insurance savings products (measured by thedifference between the average
        crediting rates of listed insurers and 1Y WMPyields) started to decrease in Jan 2017 and turned negative in Jul
        2017.<br/><br/>
        Historically, this has had a strong correlation to VNB growth and will likely hitsavings product sales. To
        account for this, we have lowered our 2018E VNBforecasts by 4-10% and revised down our target multiples for some
        insurers.<br/><br/>
        We believe insurers with a stronger protection focus should be relativelyresilient. We have analyzed the 9M17
        change in listed Chinese life insurers¡¯risk exposure based on C-ROSS. Our analysis shows NCI as having the
        highestproportion of insurance risk (an indicator for protection focus) at 63%, followedby Ping An at 44%,
        Taiping at 33%, CPIC at 30% and China Life at a mere 4%.<br/><br/>
        P&amp;C;: Upward pressure on combined ratio (CR).<br/><br/>
        We maintain a neutral view on the P&amp;C; business as we expect the autoinsurance CR to trend up in
        2018E/2019E. We expect a second round of autopremium reform in Jun-2017 to result in: (i) a higher auto loss
        ratio due tolower premium rates, and (ii) a lower expense ratio as a result of tighter CIRCscrutiny on expenses.
        We note that there are timing differences ¨C the benefitsof lower expenses would be captured right away in 2H17E
        while the drag froma higher loss ratio would likely surface over 12-18 months (in 2018E). As such,we expect the
        loss ratio to start to trend up in 2018E and we forecast PICC¡¯soverall CR to rise to 97.2%/97.5% in 2018E/2019E,
        from 96.2% in 2017E.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining positive view on Life, neutral on P&amp;C.;<br/><br/>
        We have rolled forward our target valuations to 2018E, which helps offsetlower VNB forecasts and lower target
        multiples. We maintain a positive viewon the sector, as valuations remain inexpensive and have not priced in
        thesector¡¯s growth potential. The sector is trading at 1.0x 2018E P/EV despite anaverage EV growth of 18%, which
        we see as attractive. Our top picks remainPing An and NCI, given their relatively strong protection focus, which
        shouldbe more resilient amid rising yield competition. We downgrade China Life toHold, as it could be the most
        vulnerable to weaker demand for savingsproducts, given its high leverage to these policies. Unless we see a
        significantpick-up in protection focus, we believe China Life could remain a value trap inthe near term.
        Downside risks: significant investment market weaknesses,weaker-than-expected VNB growth and unfavorable
        regulatory developments.<br/><br/>
        Upside risks include better-than-expected investment return and VNB growth.</p>
