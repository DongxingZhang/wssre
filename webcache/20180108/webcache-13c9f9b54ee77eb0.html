    <p> Leveraging New Oriental brand to drive the K12 tutoring business.<br/><br/>
        We are initiating coverage on New Oriental (EDU) with a Buy rating and atarget price of USD116. EDU is one of
        the top brands in China¡¯s educationmarket. Leveraging its ¡°New Oriental¡± brand, which has been in operation
        formore than two decades with more than 800 learning centers and schools, EDUhas shifted its strategy to focus
        more on the K12 tutoring business thataccounts for more than half of the company¡¯s total revenue. We expect EDU
        torecord a CAGR of 31% in earnings during FY2018-21, mainly driven by the K12segment (CAGR of 35%) and operating
        leverage.<br/><br/>
        Gaining market share in K12 market seems to be the priority over profitability.<br/><br/>
        EDU added 90 new learning centers in the last two quarters on strong demandfrom the K12 market. Both Pop Kids
        and U-Can, EDU¡¯s K12 brands, continuedto deliver strong growth: 35%+ yoy in 1Q18. Although non-GAAP
        operatingprofit margin may face pressure (1Q18 margin down by 4ppts) in the shortterm, we believe this will help
        solidify and enhance its market share in the longterm as the sector is still extremely fragmented (EDU has only
        less than 2%market share). However, management has said that the OP margin will recoverand will be maintained at
        a healthy 17-18% in the long term.<br/><br/>
        High growth from lower-tier cities on continued penetration and online K12.<br/><br/>
        In addition to stable and robust growth from key cities (i.e., 36-40% yoygrowth in Beijing and Shanghai), we
        believe EDU should record higher growth(like-for-like basis) from lower-tier cities in the future. EDU should
        see 5-8%growth from price hikes and 10-15% growth from the addition of new learningcenters in lower-tier cities
        where it will implement its dual-teacher businessmodel. Online K12 (Koolearn) should continue robust growth of
        40-50% yoy,and we see an accelerated growth potential in the future. Koolearn is one ofthe few online K12
        platforms that makes a profit in China (margin of 10-15%).<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        Our target price of USD116 is based on DCF (11.4% WACC and 3% TGR). Ourtarget price translates to a PEG of 1.1x
        which we believe is justified given itsmarket-leading position and sustainable and visible long-term growth.
        Risksinclude: 1) change in government policies; 2) hasty expansion; and 3) inabilityto attract and retain
        qualified teachers.</p>
