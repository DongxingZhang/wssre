    <p> Event<br/><br/>
        In the battle of survival shooter mobile game (link), the clout is modestlyflowing to the side of NetEase with
        the clock ticking (the later Tencent¡¯s twoPUBG mobile games can be launched, the less threat it can bring). With
        themonetization of Terminator 2 kicking off from late last week, we try to estimatethe grossing of Wilderness
        and Terminator 2 for 2018 (RMB750m andRMB420m respectively for monthly average) based on the DAU. We lift
        our2018-19 EPS by 1-2% and raise TP to US$395.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Quantifying Wilderness (aka Knives Out). Terminator 2 kicked offmonetization from its latest version updated on
        13 December. From this initialmonetization, players can top up and purchase costumes for their owncharacters. We
        also see signs of monetization upcoming for Wilderness,which already offers costumes and placement marketing etc
        from versionupdated on 16 Dec, though so far can just purchase via virtual currencyearned internally. We expect
        more ways of monetization to come. In terms ofgrossing, we expect this genre to feature low ARPU (but high user
        base) asMOBA genre. With the 13m and 5m DAU of Wilderness/ Terminator 2 forChina (Quest Mobile data; compared to
        47m DAU of HoK), we model averagemonthly grossing of around RMB750m for Wilderness and RMB420m forTerminator 2
        for 2018 (compared to HoK¡¯s RMB2-3bn).<br/><br/>
        Blue-sky scenario suggests fair value of US$570, which is based on thescenario that NetEase¡¯ Wilderness becomes
        on par with HoK in terms of userbase and sustainability and fulfilment of these games¡¯ overseas
        performance(Terminator 2 had topped No1 download rank in seven countries includingUS). We model monthly average
        grossing of RMB2bn and RMB1bn forWilderness and Terminator 2 respectively (Fig 17). Bear-case, whichsuggests
        Tencent launches the two PUBG mobile games soon and gainstraction swiftly, implies fair value of US$270 (with
        RMB400m for these twogames in total).<br/><br/>
        Game event: gives more freedom to players. From the game event held inShanghai on 17 December, we feel that the
        sandbox concept is the coretheme for NetEase¡¯s upcoming pipelines (Fig 19). The company unveiledAlive, another
        competitive sandbox mobile game (resembles survival shootergenre) that tested on iOS from 15 Dec, and
        highlighted the high freedomgameplay for Chu Liuxiang, the MMORPG to start testing from Feb 2018. Forexisting
        titles, the MOBA game based on Onmyoji IP will be launched soon.<br/><br/>
