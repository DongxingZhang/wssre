    <p> Tech Hardware: Leading CCM makers¡¯ shipment growth slowed in Nov<br/><br/>
        Online media reports have indicated that in Nov, several top domestic handset brands such asHuawei, OPPO, VIVO
        and Xiaomi, reduced component orders by 10%-20%, while it is expected thatin Dec, orders will be cut by up to
        20%-30%. We believe that leading CCM makers, as the coresuppliers of CCMs for Chinese smartphone brands, are
        more sensitive to changes in the downstreamshipments of Chinese smartphone manufacturers. The slowdown in CCM
        shipment growth in Novwas likely attributable to a significant deceleration in YoY smartphone shipment growth
        downstream.<br/><br/>
        Yuexiu Property (123HK, Buy): Management expects a contract sales CAGR of 30% during2018-20<br/><br/>
        We had a conference call with management yesterday. Management¡¯s targeted contract salesgrowth during 2018-20is
        higher than our expectation. In our view, the company is gradually shiftingfrom a Guangzhou-based regional
        developer into a nationwide player. We see its SOE backgroundas a positive factor in acquiring relatively cheap
        land banks in the future, which will improve its grossmargin. The new management has brought positive changes
        for the company, with improvingearnings visibility and more aggressive sales targets. We see several share price
        catalysts; maintainBuy and TP of HK$2.60.</p>
