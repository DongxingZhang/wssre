    <p> China¡¯s digital reading business heralds substantial growth propelled byrising paid subscription take-up and
        ARPU. China¡¯s RMB12bn digitalreading market grew a further 25% YoY in 2016, with online literature, ebooksand
        audiobooks respectively accounting for 38.1%, 37.6% and24.3%. This market is expected to charge ahead at a CAGR
        of 35-50%towards 2020, thanks mainly to a doubling paid subscription take-up rateand an ARPU growth rate of
        5-7%, in our estimation.<br/><br/>
        Digital reading produces profits through paid subscription, adplacement, copyright sales and physical book
        publication. Paidsubscription as the major cash cow contributed 82.2% of total digitalreading revenue in China
        in 2016, down 8.3 pct YoY, with copyright salesand adverts gaining more ground to account for 6.5% and
        4.8%,respectively. The aggregate number of online literature books in Chinawas 11.6mn by year-end 2016, up 19.6%
        YoY, and is expected to grow ata CAGR of 17.8% to 22.4mn by 2020.<br/><br/>
        Our picks for this sector include China Literature (772:HK), ChineseAll(300364:CH) and IReader (603533:CH),
        which dominate the domesticonline literature landscape with a 72%/27.5%/5.2% market share. ChinaLiterature, a
        Tencent spinoff, logged a revenue/profit ofRMB1.924bn/213mn in 1H17, carrying forward robust momentum from2016,
        when the company posted RMB2.557bn/1.054bn in operatingrevenue/gross profit, up 59.1%/81.7% YoY, alongside a
        gross margin of41.3% and a net profit of RMB30.36mn. Looking ahead, we believe thereis still a potential upside
        to China Literature¡¯s net profit given its revenuegrowth far outpaces the growth of its marketing spend and SG&amp;Aexpense.;
        IReader reported RMB773mn in first-half revenue, up 63.08%YoY, building on a revenue/net profit of
        RMB1.198bn/77.21mn in 2016,up 87.23%/161.1% YoY. ChineseAll was the first Chinese digital readingcompany to
        float on the stock market. Ever since its 2015 IPO, thecompany has been maintaining an average revenue growth
        rate of 50%,with its operating revenue/net profit attributable to the parent comingin 30.81%/132.14% higher YoY
        at RMB297mn/28.965mn in 1H17.<br/><br/>
