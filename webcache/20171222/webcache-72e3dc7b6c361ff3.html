    <p> Led by a fundamental shift in investors' long-term view on oil price, and a decadeof subpar returns and value
        creation by the E&amp;P; sector, there is increasingpressure on US E&amp;Ps; to show greater capital discipline,
        returns, and maybe evena path towards cash return to shareholders. Within, we examine both drivers andpotential
        forward looking scenarios, with the conclusion that: 1) over the next 5+years the sector can generate higher
        growth and FCF than the market suspects,even at $50/bbl, 2) there is precedent for similar transitions which
        have beenrewarded by investors, and 3) heavily discounted future FCF offers an attractivevalue relative to other
        industrial/cyclicals in the broader market. Positive: EOG,NBL (Upgrade to Buy), MRO.</p>
