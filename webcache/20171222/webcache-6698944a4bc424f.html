    <p> While Jacob Zuma remains the President of South Africa, the newly electedpresident of the ANC is widely regarded
        as the most likely individual to bePresident of the country post the 2019 elections (the ANC has won a
        sizeableoutright majority in every general election since 1994) or potentially earlier ifthe ANC "recalls" Mr
        Zuma. We view Mr Ramaphosa's election as positivefor sentiment towards the mining sector as 1) he is seen as the
        relativelyreformist/pro-growth/business-friendly candidate; and 2) he has called for furthernegotiation between
        the government and industry on the contentious MiningCharter 3, which industry has rejected outright and is
        challenging in court.<br/><br/>
        Mr Ramaphosa is viewed as a "pro-growth" candidate; having outlined hisvision for the economy in a plan named
        the "New Deal for Jobs, Growth andTransformation" in his campaign for the ANC election, which has earned him
        thetag of the "reformist" candidate. Mr Ramaphosa's victory is positive for sentiment,in our view, given the
        prevailing opinion that he is a strong advocate of the SouthAfrica Constitution (having played a central role in
        the drafting thereof) and, byextension, the rule of law. With a recent history as a successful businessmanin
        South Africa, Mr Ramaphosa is viewed as more likely to adopt a relativelymore "business friendly" stance than
        Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who campaignedon an intent to pursue "radical economic transformation" - an economic
        stancewhich appears, in our view, to prioritise redistribution over growth to tackle SouthAfrica's extreme
        levels of inequality.<br/><br/>
        The relationship between Government and the Mining Industry in South Africa hasbeen confrontational in the
        recent past, in our view. The Chamber of Mines (CoM),an industry body, has refused to endorse the latest
        iteration of the Mining Chartergazetted (although currently suspended) by the Department of Mineral
        Resources(DMR). Mr Ramaphosa has previously said that industry and government needto go back to the drawing
        board and find a consensus position on the MiningCharter. A negotiated approach (as opposed to the current
        litigious one) wouldbe viewed favourably by the market, in our view, although it is not clear thatany potential
        change in governments' approach would be early enough for theparties abandonment of legal processes, in our
        view. The Mining Charter hasbeen the subject of a number of legal challenges. The first case worth mentioningis
        a determination sought by the Chamber on the interpretation of continuing consequences; or the so-called
        "once-empowered always-empowered" question.<br/><br/>
        The determination being sought, simplistically, is whether black ownership levelsof mines are required to be
        maintained in perpetuity. Judgment was reserved bythe High Court on 10 November 2017. The second case we
        highlight is scheduledto be heard on 19-21 February 2018 and concerns the Chamber of Mines askingthe High Court
        to review and set aside the Mining Charter. The Mining andPetroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) Amendment
        Bill is also yet to bepassed, adding further to the regulatory uncertainty in the South African miningsector.
