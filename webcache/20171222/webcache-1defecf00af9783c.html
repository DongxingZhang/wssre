    <p> Conclusion<br/><br/>
        Tencent and JD.com today jointly announced to enter into definitiveagreements with Vipshop ¨C investing an
        aggregate US$863m in Vipshop atUS$13.08 per ADS ¨C a 55% premium over Friday's closing price, and grantingVipshop
        entries to the Weixin and JD.com platforms. We believe thecooperation will benefit both JD.com and Vipshop ¨C
        assisting JD.com torevamp its apparel business and bringing user traffic to Vipshop. We also seesynergies
        between the two companies¡¯ logistic businesses. We maintainOutperform on JD.com and Alibaba, but switch our
        preference to JD, as webelieve the deal will help JD on both GMV growth and margin; and we believethe market
        will act positively on Vipshop.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Investment of US$863m from Tencent and JD.com. Tencent and JD.comwill invest c.US$604m and c.US$259m in Vipshop,
        respectively, through thesubscription of newly issued shares, which will be subject to a two-year lockup
        restriction. Upon closing, Tencent and JD.com will hold 7% and 5.5% stakein Vipshop, and have the option to
        increase their stake to 12% and 8%,respectively. The purchase price will be at US$13.08 per ADS, a 55%premium
        over the closing price of US$8.44 on 15 December.<br/><br/>
        Vipshop to utilize traffic from Weixin and JD.com. Tencent and JD.comhave also concurrently entered into a
        business cooperation agreement withVipshop, enabling Vipshop (60.5m annual active customers) to utilize
        trafficfrom both 1) Tencent's Weixin platform (980m MAU) with the entry on theinterface of Weixin Wallet and
        JD's Weixin Discovery shopping entry, and 2)JD.com's platform (266m annual active customer vs. 488m of BABA's)
        with theentry on the main page of JD's mobile application. We believe the access toTencent's and JD's user base
        may help Vipshop to re-accelerate its active usergrowth, which slowed down from 43% yoy in 3Q16 to 15% yoy in
        3Q17. JD.comwill also assist Vipshop in achieving certain GMV targets through JD¡¯s platform.<br/><br/>
        JD.com to put up a fight in the apparel space. We see the investment inVipshop as a key move for JD.com to
        better compete in the online apparelspace. In 3Q17, JD.com saw stagnant apparel GMV growth due to thedeparture
        of over 100 domestic apparel brands. With some brands returning,increasing female users and Vipshop's strength
        in apparel, we believe JD.comcould potentially revamp its apparel segment.<br/><br/>
        Synergy between their logistic networks. Both JD.com and Vipshop havebeen investing in their logistic and
        last-mile delivery networks. As of end-September, JD.com and Vipshop had 9m sq.m and 2.4m sq.m warehousespace,
        respectively; and together have close to 100k last mile delivery staff.<br/><br/>
        According to JD.com, its logistic network will cover every county and village inChina by the end of this year.
        The collaboration could help both companies tooptimize their network coverage and improve cost efficiency. This
        could alsoease part of the margin pressure that fulfillment investment put on Vipshop.<br/><br/>
        Outlook<br/><br/>
        We maintain Outperform on both JD.com (JD US, TP US$51) and Alibaba(BABA US, TP US$245). We switch our 12-month
        e-commerce top pick fromBABA to JD.</p>
