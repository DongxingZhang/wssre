    <p> Several weeks' outage won't do the trick.<br/><br/>
        To our eyes, the brief move above USD 65/bbl Brent, followed by a sharper movelower, has some of the hallmarks
        of late-stage exhaustion. Although this can onlybe confirmed in retrospect, such market moves on bullish news
        sometimes signala rally's maturity. The precipitating event, an outage on the Forties pipeline closingoff 417
        kb/d of production according to Bloomberg, would need to last for severalmonths rather than weeks in order to
        eliminate the Q1-18 surplus of ~500 kb/d.<br/><br/>
        We remain of the view that near-term risks are to the downside.<br/><br/>
        Considering the counter factual.<br/><br/>
        If prices were to return to USD 65/bbl Brent and remain stable at that level, thatwould be a clearer sign that
        the market is comfortably skeptical about the abilityof US tight oil to grow more significantly even in a higher
        WTI environment.<br/><br/>
        We believe USD 65/bbl Brent represents a reasonable estimate for a mid-cycleequilibrium (down from USD 70/bbl
        one year ago) as this is the level at whichmarginal forms of supply, such as Canadian oil sands, become a viable
        investmentproposition (Figure 1 and Figure 2).<br/><br/>
        Don't discount US tight oil.<br/><br/>
        We remain of the view that the US tight oil resource is both very deep andrelatively low in breakeven, Figure 3.
        Two new data points bolster the case fornear-term weakness over the next three to four months. First, the
        Septembermonthly EIA-914 survey data on US production showed a catch-up to the weeklymodel production estimates.
        Although this is likely to reflect some calibrationadjustment in addition to real production gains, it helps to
        restore confidence inrig-based models such as the Drilling Productivity Report.<br/><br/>
        Even OPEC is wary.<br/><br/>
        Second, OPEC raised its non-OPEC supply growth estimate for 2018 by 120 kb/d, from +870 kb/d yoy to +990 kb/d
        yoy, and US supply growth from +0.9 mmb/d to +1.0 mmb/d. This is notable given that OPEC has tended towards the
        upperend of agency consensus regarding the call on OPEC supply. We see this forecastchange as confirmation of
        the new wave of optimism regarding US supply startingin December, following the first two alternating waves of
        optimism (Nov-16 toJul-17) and pessimism (Jul-17 to Nov-17). This should be driven by a recovery inrig count,
        completions relative to drilling, and calculated rig productivity, Figure 5and Figure 6. In the medium term we
        see upside with a 750 kb/d deficit emergingin 2020.</p>
