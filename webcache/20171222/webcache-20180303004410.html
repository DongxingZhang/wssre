    <p> E&amp;P;: strong demand across crude and gas, crude inventories see big draws<br/><br/>
        In Nov, China crude oil production fell by 2% yoy while apparent demand surgedto 7.5% yoy. For 11M17, crude
        production fell 4% yoy while apparent demandgrew 6% yoy. Despite the 9% mom gain in Brent for Nov, crude

        11M17, gas production grew 9% while apparent demand grew15%. The severe gas shortage led to a surge in imports,
        up 44% in Nov or 27%for 11M17, causing LNG price to exceed RMB10,000/t in many provinces orUSD29/mmbtu. Robust
        gas demand will likely persist throughout the winter withPetroChina, China BlueChem and Kunlun to benefit the

        Refining and Marketing: teapots' run rate to record historical high GRM<br/><br/>
        China crude processing volume retreated from the historical high of 50.5mt inOct, but still recorded 49.4mmt in

        andstood at USD11.93/bbl throughout the quarter to 18Dec vs. the seven-year highof USD11.98/bbl for 3Q17. Such
        high margins spurred refining activities acrossall major oil products. The output of gasoline/diesel/kerosene
        increased by 4%/6%/ 9% yoy in Oct, although stats in Nov are yet to be released. The run rate ofShandong teapots
