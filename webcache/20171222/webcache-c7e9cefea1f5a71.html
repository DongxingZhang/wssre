    <p> There are no substantial changes from the last update. Model results do not showany drop in price for the next

        Factoring the last macro releases from China in, the fair value would be USD77.7/tonne now (bands USD
        60.6-94.7/tonne); conditional projections for nextquarters point to a price of USD 72.9/tonne.<br/><br/>
        We have no allocation on the ore: market price is within error bands. We closed along position when the target
        of USD 68/tonne was reached in 24 November 2017.</p>
