    <p> Samsung Electronics (SEC) and SK Hynix are both on track to post record-high quarterlyresults in 4Q17, with our
        new forecasts having the former¡¯s operating profit hittingKRW15.9t (vs our previous estimate of KRW16.5t),
        thanks to won strengthening andspecial semiconductors division incentive payments, and despite solid
        semiconductorsprices.<br/><br/>
        SK Hynix will likely post a 4Q17 operating profit of KRW4.36t (vs our previous estimate ofKRW4.05t), which will
        likely owe to unexpectedly large chip price hikes and an eased costburden (which had been expected to rise q-q).
        It remains unknown how Korea¡¯s numbertwochipmaker pared costs as it prepared for 18nm DRAM and 3D NAND
        massproduction.<br/><br/>
        Won appreciation should have SEC¡¯s reducing operating profit drop by over KRW400bfor the quarter, and has been
        seen during the past two years, quarterly appreciation ofKRW20-30 to the US dollar cut its operating profit by
        roughly KRW300b. In 3Q16 thisloss soared to KRW700b as the won gained KRW40 against the greenback and othermajor
        currencies. We note, however, that special bonus payments of KRW400b-KRW500b to semiconductors staff and related
        vendors are bound to be a one-off.<br/><br/>
        Forex effects and bonus payments could add to SEC¡¯s cost by upwards of KRW1t for thequarter, but with its
        operating profit set to miss our estimates by only KRW600b, resultsotherwise appear solid.<br/><br/>
        By division, SEC¡¯s 4Q semiconductors earnings likely exceeded our forecast, backed bystrong chip prices, but its
        handset earnings likely fell short due to reduced subsidies in theUS and China.</p>
