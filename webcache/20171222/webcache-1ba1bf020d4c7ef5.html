    <p> I guess QE did work. With interest rates at near zero, Act 1 of QE was to shift investor preferenceup the
        liquidity curve into higher yielding and riskier assets. We did get asset reflation inequities, bonds and real
        estate. The problem was, the wealthy have a lower inclination to spendand would rather store their gains.
        Corporates preferred the liquidity for share buybacks. Andhouseholds were de-leveraging post-GFC and in no mood
        to consume. So despite the surge inliquidity, the use (or velocity) of money globally was at record lows. It
        took the real economyseveral years to heal through wealth effect and lower cost of capital.<br/><br/>
        Act 2 has finally arrived. It is the transmission of this liquidity to stimulate aggregate demand.<br/><br/>
        Global economies are back to a growth mode not seen in five years, according to IMF. To keepthis recovery on a
        self-sustaining path, we need a positive feedback loop of higher sales thatspur further employment and capital
        investment. This then feeds into higher aggregate demandand sales. As corporate profits recover, peppered with
        the usual dash of executive optimism,we have finally seen a revival in investments. Employment has recovered to
        multi-year highsbut lacking has been wage growth. It has been creeping up but not robust. Higher wages
        iscritical. Money can then be placed in the hands of those with a higher propensity to spend andmore liquidity
        will flow into the real economy. In summary, we expect the rally in global growthto continue in 2018. Wage
        growth will be the final cog to sustain an above-trend growth, evenin the face of rising interest
        rate.<br/><br/>
        Strategy: Under such a macro scenario that we construct our playbook for 2018. The sector wefavour the most is
        banks. Banks will be surfing the wave of rising interest rates, recovery in assetquality and higher loan
        volumes. The concoction could not get any better. Property stocks webelieve can perform until at least the 1H18.
        We still view them as a trade because of highvacancy rates, stretched affordability and fluid demand. We fear
        these could be roadblocks toany secular story. Our other Overweight is consumer. With wage growth improving
        (personalwish too), consumers in Singapore should open up their wallets again. This is our laggardOverweight as
        data has not revealed itself yet.<br/><br/>
        STI Target: We raise our STI target from 3450 to 3900. This a bottoms-up target, based on aculmination consensus
        and our target prices. At 3900, PE for STI will be around 17x.<br/><br/>
        Recommendation: In our absolute return portfolio for 2018, our top 10 picks are: a) Asian PayTVand Ascendas
        REIT, for those with an appetite for only dividend yield; b) Chip Eng Seng, DairyFarm, DBS Group, Geo Energy and
        Micro-Mechanics, for earnings growth; c) ComfortDelGro,Banyan Tree and CapitaLand are our re-rating plays.</p>
