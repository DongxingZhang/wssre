    <p> UK Clothing market -1.7% over 12 weeks to 19 November.<br/><br/>
        We take two key points from the Kantar WorldPanel data reported today: 1)average price growth has significantly
        slowed; 2) Primark gained the most share,while M&amp;S; improved the most. The period reported has 11 weeks of
        new datafor Debenhams, 9 for Primark, 7 for M&amp;S; and 3 for Next. Inside we also look atthe latest M&amp;S;
        switching spend data.<br/><br/>
        A weak market driven by womenswear.<br/><br/>
        The market deterioration was driven entirely by womenswear (-2%) and was alsoentirely explained by volumes.
        Despite inflation, achieved selling prices were flat,slower than the price growth seen earlier in 2017. Recent
        trends in discountedspend may have put downward pressure on price growth, with the discountedmarket (+1.8%)
        outperforming the full price market (-3.4%) since October.<br/><br/>
        Primark gained the most share....<br/><br/>
        Debenhams lost 6bps of share over the 12 week period (vs +14bps over in theprior period) driven by weaker trends
        in womenswear and kidswear. Within this,full price sales (-4.3%) underperformed discount (-1.9%). Meanwhile
        Primarkcontinued to be the stand out winner, with total share gains of +42bps, thoughthese gains slowed from the
        prior period.<br/><br/>
        ...while M&amp;S; saw the greatest improvement.<br/><br/>
        M&amp;S; saw the greatest year on year improvement, with flat market share versusa decline of 48bps last month.
        This is M&amp;S;' second share gain on our records,which go back to September 2012. This was driven by better
        performance inwomenwear, while its full price market share remained negative (-10bps) butimproved on the prior
        month (-20bps). Next's share gains faded slightly to +4bps,from +15bps in the prior month, and despite gaining
        20bps of full price share, wenote this was significantly weaker than the +60bps last month. We set out
        ourpreviews in Christmas Turkeys and Crackers, 7 December 2017.<br/><br/>
        Our clothing sector top pick is A B Foods.<br/><br/>
        Next trades on 10.7x, M&amp;S; on 11.0x, ABF on 20.3x and Debenhams on 6.2xcalendar 2018 PE vs the UK General
        Retail sector (ex ABF, Asos and Boohoo) on12.4x. Our target prices are generally DCF-based using WACC of
        8.3-8.6% andnominal TGR¡¯s of 1-1.5%, though for ABF we use sum-of-the-parts. Risks include:improved/
        (deteriorating) consumer spending overall or a recovery in allocation toclothing, market share gains/ (losses)
        of individual retailers.</p>
