    <p> Asian markets are unchanged to stronger this morning. In FX, the notable underperformer is theTHB (0.4% weaker
        vs. USD).<br/><br/>
        In CEEMEA, in South Africa, the outcome of the ANC conference saw Cyril Ramaphosa claimingvictory over Nkosazana
        Dlamini-Zuma for the position of the new ANC President, which led to ZARgaining 5.8% vs. the USD. However, the
        move appears to be overdone. Among the Top 6 that willnow be steering the ANC forward, 3 of these belong to the
        ¡®traditionalist¡¯ camp, aligned withZuma. The shared influence over the ANC between the traditionalists and
        reformists looks likely toimpinge on Ramaphosa¡¯s ability to deal with state capture and poor structural economic
        growth.<br/><br/>
        Today, the members of the 80-committee NEC will be voted on. This committee will be importantin any decision to
        request Zuma, as President of the country, to step down early (in January 2018,for example). For further
        comments, please see South African politics: Stalemate. We will beholding another conference call this morning
        so please look out for details.<br/><br/>
        From a strategy point of view, we note that 1-week and 1-month realised forward returns onshort USDZAR positions
        are at extremely high levels (Charts 1 and 2). Mean reversion of thesereturns, currently in the tails of the
        distribution, is increasingly likely. Therefore, as highlighted inour piece, South Africa: Interest rates lag
        behind, we continue to prefer receiving rates thanchasing a rally in the rand.<br/><br/>
        Today, in Hungary, the central bank will hold its final policy meeting of the year and release itsinflation
        report. The central bank in November highlighted new unconventional policy tools toflatten the yield curvem,
        effective in January. Hence we do not expect any policy changes today.</p>
