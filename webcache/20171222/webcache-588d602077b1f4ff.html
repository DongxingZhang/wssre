    <p> Following the second-round run-off on 17 December, Sebastian Pi?era was elected president ofChile for the second
        time. With 98.4% of the votes counted, Mr Pi?era had 54.6% comparedwith 45.5% for Alejandro Guillier, the
        candidate for the ruling coalition 每 an unexpectedlycomfortable margin. The result had been expected to be tight
        following Mr Pi?era＊s weakperformance in the first round, where he won only 36.6% of total votes despite support
        of morethan 40% reported by opinion polls ahead of the election.<br/><br/>
        Mr Pi?era served as president in 2010每14 and will take office again in March 2018. (Theconstitution prevents
        presidents running for a second consecutive term.)Markets are likely to cheer the result, inasmuch as asset
        prices had sold off following MrPi?era＊s disappointing first-round performance. Market participants consider Mr
        Pi?era to be apro-business candidate who is expected to improve efficiency and streamline regulation in orderto
        kick-start investment, which has underperformed in recent years.<br/><br/>
        One of Mr Pi?era＊s main promises during the presidential campaign was to strive to restoregrowth to its
        potential pace 每 something that has not been seen in Chile in the past four years 每and his victory is likely to
        lift business expectations.<br/><br/>
        We forecast growth to accelerate to 3% in 2018 (roughly around its potential pace), helped by asupportive global
        context in general and higher copper prices in particular. Whether or not hecan oversee an effective growth
        recovery is likely to be the first key test of his second term.<br/><br/>
        While the 2018 growth outlook probably does not depend much on the election result, we wouldsee Mr Pi?era＊s
        election as probably positive for Chile＊s medium-term growth prospects.<br/><br/>
        In his victory speech on Sunday evening, President-elect Pi?era adopted a conciliatory tone.<br/><br/>
        With his centre-right National Renewal party short of a majority in congress, negotiations withthe opposition
        look unavoidable. Mr Pi?era called for dialogue and consensus as necessaryconditions for progress. In his
        concession, Mr Guillier promised to cooperate with the incomingadministration in his role as the opposition
        leader.<br/><br/>
        The fragmented composition of congress suggests the policy agenda will probably be relativelymoderate. Key
        issues that need to be discussed in congress include education and tax reformsimplemented by the incumbent
        President Michelle Bachelet, the pension fund system andhealth insurance. Mr Pi?era has said he is willing to
        address strong criticism of the pension fundindustry 每 for example, by creating a state-owned pension fund to
        increase competition 每 butopposes eliminating the current system.<br/><br/>
        On the fiscal front, we expect to see only a gradual improvement in the fiscal imbalance. Thelatter deteriorated
        visibly in recent years to a 2.7% of GDP deficit in 2016 from a modest surplusin 2012. Our current forecasts
        project the fiscal deficit to narrow from 2.6% of GDP in 2017 to2.3% in 2018.</p>
