        3Q17 net revenue grew 34% YoY, at the high end of mgmt.¡¯s previous guidance of 30-34%. Blended RevPAR growth
        further accelerated to 22% YoY, from 14% in 2Q17, driven by both ADR (+12% YoY) and occupancy rate (+4ppts YoY).

        Well committed in accelerating expansion in FY18E.<br/><br/>
        1) HTHT guided 29-32% YoY growth in 4Q17E net revenue, with full-year guidance of 24-25% (from 23-26%) on solid
        RevPAR trend and Crystal Orange¡¯s contribution. 2) Mgmt. maintained FY17E gross opening guidance of 500, on the
        back of 138 hotels consolidated from Crystal Orange. 3) HTHT expects to accelerate gross opening to 650-700 in
        FY18E, with 60-65% coming from mid-to-upscale segment.<br/><br/>
        Decent result despite well-elevated street expectation.<br/><br/>
        HTHT currently trades at 27x/18x FY18E/19E P/E, while core earnings are expected to grow 59%/43%/54% in
        FY17E/18E/19E. Our FY18E EBITDA/NP implies 8%/6% upside from consensus numbers, mainly due to
        faster-than-expected improvement in operating efficiency through the economies of scale and manachising
        business. Maintain BUY on HTHT, a major beneficiary of market consolidation of China lodging industry.</p>
