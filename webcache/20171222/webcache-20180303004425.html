    <p> Tracking a return to normality<br/><br/>
        With the twelve-month Brent curve in backwardation since September, themerchant economics of holding storage of
        any sort are unequivocally negative,Figure 1, but especially so for vessels chartered as a form of storage.
        Despitemonthly costs having fallen to USD 0.43/bbl/month in the Arabian Gulf, this is stilltoo expensive given
        the curve in backwardation, which means additional lossesfor a storage holder who must roll contracts forward as
        they expire. Thereforeglobal floating storage inventory has fallen from a June peak of 207mmbbl to 128mmbbl
        currently, Figure 2. The bulk of the drop has occurred in the Middle EastGulf and Southeast Asia regions. The
        reduction in inventory is consistent with theidea that the oil market is returning to neutral market conditions,
        and that demandhas been sufficiently strong to absorb the excess volume.<br/><br/>
        However, inventories are not yet as low as observed over the 2010-14periodwhen supply-demand deficits were
        predominant. Therefore we believe it is tooearly to expect prices to trade sustainably above the long-term
        equilibrium ofUSD 65/bbl, although such conditions will likely materialise by late 2019or 2020,Figure 3. In the
        nearer term, we see US supply returning to stronger total liquidsgrowth of +940kb/d in 2018, and an
        OPEC/non-OPEC overhang of 1.3mmb/d yetto be released over the course of 2019, which should present some
        meaningfulchallenges to price upside above USD 65/bbl, Figure 4.</p>
