    <p> Relatively weak Life; stable P&amp;C;<br/><br/>
        Life premiums recovered slightly from a weak Oct (following a strong Sept, priorto the implementation of Reg
        134) but remained relatively weak compared tothe momentum in the previous months. We believe this was likely
        driven by: (i)some insurers¡¯ focus shifting to pre-sale of 2018jumpstart policies, and (ii) weakerdemand for
        savings policies due to Reg 134and an uptick in WMP yields resultingin higher competition. Ping An and China
        Life were the only two entities thatsaw double-digit growth, of 25.5% and 14.4% yoy respectively. Ping An
        startedto adopt Reg 134in June, and maintained decent Nov FYP (ex-grp) growth at26.6% (vs. 30.7% in Oct). China
        Life has planned to start 2018jumpstart salespreparation later than peers, and thus maintained a steady growth
        momentumin Nov. P&amp;C; premium growth was largely stable, ranging from 11.2% to 27.2%(vs. 11.7% to 25.4% in
        Oct), led by Ch Taiping (+27.2%). We maintain our positiveview on Chinese insurers and prefer life over P&amp;C.;
