    <p> 2017 has been another strong year for emerging market economies andfinancial markets. We see the ¡®goldilocks¡¯
        picture of strong global growthcombined with low G4 interest rates continuing at least for the first four
        monthsof 2018. This picture should spur further returns in emerging market fixedincome and equities, even after
        the strong gains already seen. However, thepicture looks less rosy later in 2018, thanks to diminishing QE and
        loftiervaluations.</p>
