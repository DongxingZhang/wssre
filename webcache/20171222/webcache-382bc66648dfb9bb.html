    <p> Over the last decade it has become the consensus that CBs¡¯ responsibility isto ensure that growth rates do not
        significantly deviate from the norm and thatannual inflation should approximate a certain arbitrary number (most
        DMssettled on 2%). However, there has never been a logical reason why it shouldbe at that level, and while there
        is plenty of evidence that very high inflation isdetrimental, it is not clear that low inflation or mild
        deflation is negative.<br/><br/>
        The textbook answer is that in a climate of low and declining inflation, privatesector delays investment and
        consumption, and hence, it creates a growth¡®headwind¡¯. While it makes intuitive sense, evidence from countries
        as diverseas Japan, Korea and Germany suggests that the link between low inflation ormild deflation and private
        sector is far more complex. The best one could sayis that in today¡¯s world of big data and desire to squeeze the
        ¡®last ounce ofjuice¡¯, there is a palpable desire for permanent stimulus. However, by far themost important
        reason for avoiding low inflation is that the real value of debtincreases in a deflationary climate, thus
        causing a spike of debt defaults. Byinsisting on a 2%-3% inflation, CBs are engineering a slow-burn default
        byborrowers. As long as there is another Peter, you can always pay Paul. Athigh levels of leverage, even a mild
        deflation could stop the merry-go-around.<br/><br/>
        Societies have judged such outcomes unacceptable.</p>
