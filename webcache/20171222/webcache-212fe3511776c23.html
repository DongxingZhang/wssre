        Buy auto names with good product mix and marketing competitiveness We believethe government has shifted its
        policy focus from high subsidies, which led to good profitfor auto companies developing NEVs, to subsidies that
        only cover production costs, andtherefore see a decline in subsidies going forward. Over the long term, the
        governmentwill focus on emissions and NEV scoring, which should drive the sector more effectively.In addition,
        the government is pushing the sector towards being more market oriented.We suggest buying auto names with good
        product mixes and marketing competitivenessin the NEV sector. We like JAC (600418CH), SAIC Motor (600104CH) and
        Huayu Auto(600741CH).</p>
