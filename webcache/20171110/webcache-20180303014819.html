    <p> Our latest bottom-up tally of Q3 inflation-adjusted output points to less of adrag on the economy from
        hurricane-related disruptions than we had originallyanticipated. As a result, we have revised up our Q3 real GDP
        growth forecast70 basis points (bps) to 2.7% and lowered our current-quarter projection 30bps to 2.8%. At this
        point, we have not made any changes to our 2018 or2019 growth estimates of 2.2% and 1.9% (Q4/Q4), respectively.
        Regardingnext Friday¡¯s advance Q3 real GDP report, the main driver of our upgradedestimate was the exports
        sector. Previously, we had been expecting substantialdeclines in chemicals and energy exports due to the
        shuttering of activity in theGulf of Mexico region. However, the August international trade data
        showedmeaningful upward revisions to net exports whereby even if we assume someweakness in September, we are
        still likely to see a positive overall contributionto growth from the external sector. In our Q3 forecast, we
        project exports growthof 2.3% (versus 1.9% in Q2) while imports are expected to rise a lesser 1.0%.
        NextThursday's advance goods trade balance data for September should shed furtherlight on Q3 trade developments.<br/><br/>
        With respect to the other components of Q3 real GDP, we expect real PCEgrowth of 2.0% (versus 3.3% in Q2). Some
        of this downshift reflects expectedweakness in services spending, in particular electric utilities. Recall that
        inQ2, electricity expenditures surged 24% annualized, the third largest gain inthe post-recession period. Hence,
        we should see some payback from thiscategory, which may be exacerbated by the wide-spread outages in the wakeof
        the hurricanes. In addition, retail control, which is an excellent proxy for goodsspending in the GDP accounts,
        points to a moderate deceleration in Q3 PCE goodsexpenditures following a relatively robust 5.4% gain in
        Q2.<br/><br/>
        The largest hurricane-related impact on GDP may come from structuresspending, which we estimate to have declined
        -5.0% in Q3 (versus a 7.0%gain in Q2). This is partly a function of storm-related disruptions to the
        energysector, which had been the sole driver of the nearly 11% annualized increasein nonresidential structures
        spending in the first half of the year. Indeed,energy-related expenditures accounted for over 10% of the gain in
        nonresidentialequipment spending (capex) in H1. However, given the still-sturdy momentumin core durable goods
        orders through the first two months of Q3 and continuedstrength in forward-looking factory-sector surveys such
        as the manufacturing ISMand Chicago PMI, we continue to expect a solid 8% gain in capex spendingin Q3. Note that
        next Wednesday¡¯s durable goods orders report for September should sharpen forecasters¡¯ estimates for equipment
        spending ahead of Friday¡¯sGDP release.</p>
