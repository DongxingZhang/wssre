    <p> We model nickel using three different periods since 2007.<br/><br/>
        On a consolidated basis, the nickel price (LME 3-month nickel) is not substantiallyabove the fair value
        estimate, our analysis suggests.<br/><br/>
        Nickel¡¯s recent appreciation has been a catch-up to fair value, not an overreaction,according to consolidated
        results. These findings diverge from MarFATM, which isshort nickel.<br/><br/>
        Conditional projections for the coming quarters do not show a sizable deviationfrom the model¡¯s current values.
