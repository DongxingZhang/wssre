    <p> Buy rating with new target price of CNY43<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our Buy rating on Hikvision and raise our target price to CNY43from CNY34.5, as we raise our
        earnings forecast and lift the target multiple to30x from 25x, driven by our expectation of accelerated earnings
        growth due tomargin expansion.<br/><br/>
        Better-than-expected margin expansion and outlook<br/><br/>
        We have been highlighting Hikvision¡¯s margin expansion through a risingsolution business and management efforts.
        3Q17GPM of 46% is a high since2015, above DB/consensus expectations of 42%. As Hikvision continues topursue
        solution business opportunities in overseas markets and its domesticmarket continues to improve, we expect the
        company to sustain the 2017margin expansion into 2018/2019at 44%.<br/><br/>
        AI strategy focuses on edge cloud computing<br/><br/>
        Hikvision recently announced its ¡°AI cloud¡± framework at the 16th publicsafety expo in Shenzhen. Its strategy
        focuses on edge cloud for videosurveillance applications, which allows faster responses and the filtering
        ofunnecessary data from video/images captured by millions of camerasconstantly. In addition to domestic
        transportation and security projects,Hikvision has won a smart city project in Singapore of over USD10mn.
        Theincreasing adoption of AI presents upside risks to revenue and margins.<br/><br/>
        Positive progress in the innovation business<br/><br/>
        In addition to AI, the innovation business is a growth catalyst at Hikvision. Thelargest contributor is Ezviz,
        whose subscribers exceed 20mn. In addition to aconsumer client base, it has business clients, such as retail
        chain and propertymanagement companies, which utilize the Ezviz cloud to track client traffic andmonitor
        premises. Its robot business has landed orders for three types ofrobots for JD.com¡¯s automated warehouse in
        Shanghai. We expect theinnovation business to grow 142%/83% in 2017/2018.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Hikvision¡¯s share price has appreciated over 150%+ YTD (vs. ShenzhenComposite index: 2%). We expect it to
        continue re-rating, given acceleratedprofit growth from AI exposure, rising innovation contributions, and
        marginimprovement. Our new target price of CNY43is based on 30x FY2018E PE,which lies toward the top end of the
        company¡¯s historical trading range, andwould be supported by an accelerated 34% profit CAGR in
        2017-2019E,compared to a 26% profit CAGR in 2014-2016. Risks: market share loss, weakdemand in industry project
