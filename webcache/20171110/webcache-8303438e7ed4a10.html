    <p> Volume growth normalized: As expected, Daqin Railway¡¯s coal throughputgrowth further normalized to 11.5% YoY in
        October 2017from a highercomparison base, down from 25.8% YoY in September 2017. Sequentially, the37.36mt volume
        remained largely flat vs. 37.39mt in September 2017, partlyhelped by a postponed maintenance period (October
        25¨CNovember 15, 2017) vs.2016(October 9¨C28, 2016).<br/><br/>
        In the first ten months of 2017, Daqin¡¯s aggregate coal volumes rebounded30.6% YoY, vs. -17.8% weakness in the
        same period of 2016.<br/><br/>
        Demand remained robust: Daqin¡¯s normalizing coal throughput growth inOctober 2017was partly led by a higher
        volume base in October 2016, as thenegative demand growth reversed to 12.5% YoY.Average coal prices in October
        2017still improved 1.3% YoY and 0.7% MoM, toRmb620.0/ton. Coal inventory at Qinhuangdao increased significantly
        at 60%YoY, to 6.89mt (+18% MoM).</p>
