    <p> Near-term growth to further accelerate; long-term visibility improving.<br/><br/>
        Despite c.40% share price appreciation YTD (vs. SZCOMP: +3%), we see furtherupside potential for Jonhon as
        re-rating continues to accelerate earnings growthalong with improved visibility. Revenue growth indeed
        accelerated in 3Q. Withorder momentum picking up and revenue conversion coming through, we expect4Q to deliver
        38% NP growth. Looking beyond 2017, the upcoming two roundsof capacity expansions will likely lift its
        headquarter's capacity by c.50%, andthe new capacity will be mainly used for new products and applications
        thathave substantial import substitution potential. During the previous capacityexpansion cycle (2014-15),
        Jonhon delivered earnings CAGR of 50%+. We havebeen anticipating an earnings upcycle for the coming three years,
        and we nowhave higher conviction. We see upside potential to our current assumption of aconstant growth
        acceleration of 30%+ towards 2020; maintaining Buy.<br/><br/>
        Sales growth accelerated; margin expansion continued.<br/><br/>
        3Q sales of Rmb1.5bn rose 8% yoy, a visible acceleration from 1H's 1% yoygrowth. High GPM was largely sustained
        in 3Q, which increased 2.5ppt yoy,leading to a 16% growth in GP. However, this was partially offset by higher
        opexand finance costs in 3Q. NP was up 13% yoy, which also accelerated from 1H's11% increase. 9M NP amounted to
        Rmb629m (+12% yoy), which achieved 73%of our full-year estimate (vs. the historical average of 72% during
        2007-16).<br/><br/>
        We expect a strong 4Q ahead; full-year earnings likely to beat guidance.<br/><br/>
        During our recent visit to Jonhon's Luoyang headquarters (in mid-September),management indicated that new orders
        for defense and NEV picked up sincethe beginning of 3Q (see our trip takeaway note). However, the actual
        signingof contracts took place in late 3Q (especially for defense orders, largely due tomilitary reform), which
        means revenue conversion will likely be skewed towardsthe final quarter. The company guides for a 0-15% NP
        growth for the full year, thesame wide range they guided for in 1H and 9M. Its track record suggests that
        thefinal result tends to come in towards the high end of the guided range. For thisyear we expect full-year
        earnings growth to beat guidance (DBe: +18% yoy) aswe are projecting a 38% earnings growth in 4Q.</p>
