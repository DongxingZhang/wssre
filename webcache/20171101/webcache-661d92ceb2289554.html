    <p> Buy for high earnings visibility and undemanding valuation<br/><br/>
        We upgrade Vanke A to Buy from Hold and raise our TP by 22% to RMB31.21after factoring its strong 3Q17results
        and latest land acquisitions. We believeVanke can sustain its double-digit sales growth given its proactive
        landbankingand the potential JV with SZ Metro on the two Shenzhen projects. We forecastVanke to report 30%
        earnings CAGR with post-tax gross margin expanding to24-25% in FY17-19F. Also, we expect the privatization of
        GLP to be completedby April 2018, which should be a positive share price catalyst. The stock nowtrades at 8.4x
        FY18F P/E and 21% discount to NAV, which is undemandingversus peers given its high earnings
        visibility.<br/><br/>
        Proactive landbanking and JV with SZ Metro to sustain double-digit growth<br/><br/>
        Vanke has acquired 19.0mn sqm in 3Q17(including the asset package fromGD International Trust), which is 22% more
        than its landbanking in 1H17. Weestimate these projects could add ~RMB380bn of saleable resource with
        ~25%pre-tax gross margin on average (assuming no ASP increase). Also, Vanke isbidding for the two Shenzhen
        projects (1.8mn sqm GFA) auctioned by SZMetro (Vanke¡¯s largest shareholder). We believe Vanke will likely win
        theauction and the gross margin would be &gt;50%, if the auction price is similar tothe offer price that SZ
        Metro planned for exchange of Vanke¡¯s shares before.Together with the other 40above-metro JV projects with SZ
        Metro under gooddiscussion, we believe Vanke can sustain double-digit sales growth in 2018F.<br/><br/>
        Strong full-year results and GLP deal as positive catalysts<br/><br/>
        We expect Vanke to report 30% earnings growth this year with post-tax grossmargin expanding to ~24% (vs. 20.3%
        in FY16), given there are RMB432bnunbooked sales by September. Also, the privatization of GLP is expected to
        becompleted before April 2018, which should provide synergy to Vanke¡¯s existinglogistics property business as
        its long-term earnings driver. We believe thesetwo should be positive near-term catalysts for the share
        price.<br/><br/>
        Strong 9M17results with margin expansion<br/><br/>
        Vanke reported strong 9M17results with: 1) revenue staying flat atRMB117bn; 2) post-tax gross margin expanding
        to 23.7% (vs. 20.3% in FY16);3) core profits increasing 31% to RMB10.6bn; and 4) net gearing ratioincreasing to
        38% (vs. 26% in FY16and 20% in 1H17).<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Our TP is based on a 10% discount to end-2018F NAV of RMB34.68. The stocknow trades at 8.4x FY18F P/E and at a
        21% NAV discount. Key risks: 1)Baoneng selling its shares in the secondary market, 2) slower property sales,and
        3) failure to acquire quality sites.</p>
