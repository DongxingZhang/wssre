    <p> This week, the FOMC will hold its monetary policy meeting on November 1st-2nd (Wednesday - Thursday). In line
        with market expectations, we do not expect to see any policy changes at this meeting; but clear signals for the
        December rate hike are expected. However, as the implied odds for the December hike is already as high as 98%,
        the more important focus is the Fed¡¯s view on inflation development which caused some divisions at the September
        meeting. Thus, the incoming September PCE inflation and the wage growth in the October non-farm payroll report
        are key to watch. Moreover, as confirmed by the White House, Trump will announce the name of the next Fed chair,
        which could have some impact on Fed¡¯s future policy direction.<br/><br/>
        The minutes of the Fed¡¯s September meeting stated that the lack of inflation was still a concern, at least for
        some members. The US inflation has been subdued for most of this year. The Fed¡¯s preferred measure, core PCE
        inflation, dropped from 1.9% YoY in February all the way to 1.3% in August. Specifically, as we have elaborated,
        the price fall of telecommunication services and the decelerated price growth of financial services have
        contributed to around 0.25 ppts fall of the headline PCE or almost 0.3 ppts fall of the core PCE this year.
        Although the hurricane effect has dramatically driven up the gasoline price and could lead to the recovery of
        headline inflation, we do not expect the upcoming September PCE data to show significant improvement of the core
        measure.<br/><br/>
        However, looking forward, as the price war in the telecom industry has come to an end and the price growth of
        financial services has dropped back to 10-year average, these two factors¡¯ drag on the core PCE should be
        one-off and could gradually fade. Moreover, the September job report showed that wage growth significantly
        picked up during the month, from 0.2% MoM to 0.5% MoM, suggesting that the wage push inflation could finally
        been restored. Also, the recent market-based inflation expectations restored its upward trend, indicating that
        inflation outlook could gradually improve in the future.<br/><br/>
        For the overall economy, we see continued solid growth even after the hurricanes, and the outlook is balanced to
        the upside. ISM manufacturing PMI kept achieving recent highs and beating market expectations. After reaching
        60.8 in September, we expect the October data, releasing this week, to remain in strong expansion. The 3Q GDP
        data confirmed such optimistic sentiment in PMI survey, by growing 3.0% QoQ, SAAR, with the hurricanes loss
        estimated at USD 121.0 billion for privately fixed assets. The major force that led to the solid growth was
        still personal consumption, which contributed 1.62 points to the 3Q growth. Moreover, as the Senate has passed
        the budget resolution on October 20th, which enabled an easier pass of the tax reform in 1H18. Although the 20
        ppt corporate tax cut could hurt the US fiscal situation, it would also improve corporate profits and GDP growth
        in general, especially benefitting small businesses. Thus, we see that the US growth outlook is balanced
        somewhat to the upside; and this robust growth condition should finally be able to push up prices.<br/><br/>
        Another eye-catching event this week should be the announcement of the next Fed chair: as confirmed by the White
        house, Trump will make the announcement, sometime during this week. Currently, the four most likely candidates
        include: Jerome Powell, John Taylor, Janet Yellen and Kevin Warsh. Our sense is that Taylor and Warsh are on the
        hawkish side, i.e., more inclined to raise rates, which could lead to a faster monetary normalization; while,
        Yellen and Powell would mean policy continuity.<br/><br/>
        In sum, this week is a busy week for US releases, with a number of key data becoming available and the heavily
        discussed Fed Chair appointment. We expect the data releases to continue showing steady growth of the US
        economy, and the inflation is more likely to gradually pick up than stay subdued. Moreover, the appointment of
        the next Fed Chair could have some impact on Fed¡¯s future policy stance, and we see risks are more balance
        towards the hawkish side.</p>
