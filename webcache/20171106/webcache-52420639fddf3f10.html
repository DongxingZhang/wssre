        Sales outlook: Yili guided Rmb65bn sales and Rmb6.2bn profit beforetax at the beginning of the year. Management
        indicates that actualgrowth could be better than previous guidance. In the next few years,management expects
        industry growth to remain strong, given low percapita consumption and increasing demand from lower tier
        regions.However, management also acknowledged that high base in 2017shouldbring some pressure on sales growth in
        2018.。<br/><br/>
        Industry competition didn't worsen year-to-date. Meanwhile,management feels that there is some easing down in
        promotions dueto increasing demand in September for National holidays and undersupply of raw milk in some
        regions, though there has been no significantimprovement in competition overall.。<br/><br/>
        Margin outlook:Raw milk price to enter rising cycle gradually from2018,which will bring pressure on gross
        margin. Yet, management expects thecompetition to ease down within the cost rising cycle, which should leadto a
        lower SG&amp;A;/sales ratio on fewer price promotions.。<br/><br/>
