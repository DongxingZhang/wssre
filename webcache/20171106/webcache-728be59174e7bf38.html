    <p> We see a broad weakness from China A-share power T&amp;D; equipment names¡¯ 3Qearnings reporting: NARI Tech +5%
        (vs. 1H¡¯s +25%, dragged by solar EPC), XJElectric +4% (vs. 1H¡¯s +46%, lower margin) and Pinggao Electric down
        69% (vs.1H¡¯s down 35%, lower margin/UHVAC delay). However, when looking into theunderlying operations, we find
        NARI Tech¡¯s 3Q profit weakness is relatively moretemporary than structural, with core grid business
        growth/margins and ordermomentum remaining on track. Its parentco asset injection has been approvedby SASAC,
        Ministry of Commerce and CSRC and is expected to be completedby end of this November. We continue to prefer NARI
        Tech in the sector onrelative better earnings defensiveness and growth sustainability against industryheadwinds
        (grid investment downturn, margin pressure, etc.), stronger parentcosupport, which should justify a valuation
        premium vs. peers.¡£<br/><br/>
        Solar EPC, a near-term earnings dragger, expected to be removed next year¡£<br/><br/>
        NARI Tech¡¯s 3Q revenue/net profit growth weakened to +4%/5%, respectively,from +11%/25% in 1H. This was mainly
        dragged by the shrinking solar EPCbusiness (under power generation &amp; renewable energy segment), which
        hasincurred a net loss of c.Rmb70m in 9M17due to margin contraction amidintensified pressure passed through by
        customers and competition. Managementexpects it will remain an earnings dragger into 4Q this year, which may
        lead thecompany¡¯s full-year earnings growth (before asset consolidation) to fall between10-20% (prior guidance:
        +20%). However, this impact should be temporary andwill be removed by next year, as management targets to speed
        up exiting thislow-margin business by next year.¡£<br/><br/>
        Core business performance still on track¡£<br/><br/>
        Putting solar EPC business aside, NARI Tech¡¯s 3Q core power automationbusiness growth remains stable at close to
        20%; rail automation profit tracks15-20% growth excluding PPP project contribution, according to management.GPM
        advanced by 1.6ppt on favorable product mix and resilient margins forsecondary grid automation business. Total
        order intake growth in 9M17stayssimilar to 1H¡¯s 18%. At consolidated level after asset injection,
        managementexpects it is largely on track to achieve close to 20% earnings growth target, withaccelerated UHV
        order delivery this year.¡£</p>
