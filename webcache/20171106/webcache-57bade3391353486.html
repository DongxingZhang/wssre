    <p> The company believes its PD1has a balanced efficacy and AE profile,which is not much different from marketed
        compounds. In addition,Hengrui is very well positioned for future combo therapy as it hasthe largest oncology
        drug offerings. We believe this would be a keydifferentiating element in its PD1program, which will lead to
        commercialsuccess of the drug.。<br/><br/>
        We estimate that Hengrui's PD-L1has largely completed doses escalatingin the ongoing Australia
        P1study.。<br/><br/>
        IDO IND approval is expected in the near term.。<br/><br/>
        Hengrui believes different disease etiologies between Chinese and USpatients are likely to contribute to
        different response rates. In addition tolower response rates in melanoma and NSCLC, different ORR might
        beobserved in liver, esophageal and gastric cancers.。<br/><br/>
        Out of 4ongoing P1US studies, pyrotinib in NSCLC with HER2mutationsis likely to be the priority as risk-reward
        appears appealing. We believeif meaningful POC data were to be obtained, fast track and orphan drugstatus would
        be likely.。<br/><br/>
        SHR3162, a PARP inhibitor, will enter a P2study in ovarian cancer soon,according to the company. The study may
        enroll patients who received1/2/3previous lines of therapy, not just 2L and above.。</p>
