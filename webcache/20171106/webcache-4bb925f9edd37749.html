    <p> Promising in SSSg terms, with long-term store expansion story; Buy<br/><br/>
        Yonghui's strong store-opening pipeline in 4Q17/2018gives us more confidencein its sales growth in 2018/2019F.
        SSSg is seeing sequential improvement withtraffic resuming positive growth since 3Q. We believe this is mainly
        helped by itscompetitive fresh food segment. We also believe its cost advantage from supplychain management will
        help it to achieve GPM expansion over time. We havefine-tuned our 2017/2018NP by -3%/+2% to reflect a slightly
        higher opex ratio in2017and an acceleration in store opening in 2018. We also roll over by one yearto 2019in our
        DCF model and raise our TP by 14% to RMB10.14. We maintainour Buy rating on this stock.<br/><br/>
        Yonghui reported NP up by 131% to RMB337m on sales up 20% to RMB15bn in3Q17. Sales were largely in line with DBe
        while NP was 6% lower than DBe. Thediscrepancy mainly stemmed from a higher-than-expected opex ratio. We
        expectthat SSS in 3Q was up by 1.5% vs. 0.8% in 1H17, and that Oct was even better.We expect the company to open
        106/100new stores in 2017/2018(gross base)and also to open another 100Yonghui Life and 100Super Species storesby
        2017/2018respectively. We believe its acceleration of store expansion andeffective organization structures (four
        business units and partnership model)can help the company to continuously enjoy better-than-market
        performanceand operating leverage. We forecast its NP for 2017/2018/2019to grow by47%/44%/29%, respectively.</p>
