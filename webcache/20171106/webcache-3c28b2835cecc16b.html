    <p> Yield: CSA recorded 2% YoY growth in passenger yield with 2% YoYgrowth in domestic routes (amid better
        performance in GuangdongProvince, Southern-Central region and Northeastern region), partly offsetby flattish
        yield in international routes due to route mix change.<br/><br/>
        Load factor: CSA recorded overall load factor of 82.2% in 9M17 (up 1.7pptYoY) and October load factor remained
        high. In expectation of more flightslot control, CSA plans to improve load factors by transforming the
        frontcabins of flights with low load factors in that cabin (mostly short haulflights in leisure-travel-oriented
        markets) to economy cabins.<br/><br/>
        Capacity: Management guides for c.9% passenger capacity (ASK) growthin 4Q17, with c.10% growth for domestic
        routes and c.7% for internationalroutes. Part of the growth will be supported by bigger aircraft usage andlonger
        routes. Going forward, CSA plans to expand ASK by 14% YoY inFY18, with c.11-12% domestic ASK increase and c.21%
        international ASKincrease (including growth in Australia routes, Japan routes and WestAsia routes, etc.).
        Regarding the regulator's (CAAC) latest control in flightslot growth in congested airports, CSA sees this as a
        positive to supportyield given capacity constraint.<br/><br/>
        USD borrowings and FX impact: CSA¡¯s total USD borrowings wereRMB34.6bn, accounted for 32.1% of all debt as at
