    <p> 4Q guidance below expectation but new energy vehicle (NEV) sales stillGrowing¡£<br/><br/>
        BYD has reported 3Q17results under PRC GAAP. Gross revenue grew by 3.8% YoYto RMB28.9bn on higher demand for its
        own brand passenger and commercialnew energy vehicles (up 9.7% and 7.5% YoY, respectively), partially offset by
        a36.4% YoY decline in conventional vehicle sales during the period. Gross profitmargin declined by 2.3ppt YoY
        probably on lower NEV margin after subsidy cut,in our view. Meanwhile, BYD¡¯s 3Q17net profit declined 23.9% YoY
        to RMB1.1bn,which is near the mid-range of BYD¡¯s previous guidance.¡£<br/><br/>
        In its announcement, BYD guided that it expects to register a 15.1-20.0% YoYdecline in FY17net profit to
        RMB4.04-4.29bn, which translates to 4Q17E net profitof RMB1.2-1.5bn (vs. RMB1.4bn in 4Q16), implying an YoY
        decline of up to 10.0%or an YoY growth of up to 8.0%. For 4Q17, BYD expects NEV sales to continue togrow at a
        high pace, while traditional passenger vehicle sales can improve withgood market reception for the new Song Max
        MPV. Besides, management seespositive outlook for its handset component and assembly business, and
        morerevenue/profit recognition for its monorail projects.¡£<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view - Buy BYD-H as scalable Chinese NEV play¡£<br/><br/>
        BYD¡¯s FY17E earnings guidance accounts for about 91-96% of our forecast.Considering the guidance, we trim our
        FY17-19E revenue by 0.8-3.6% on 1) moreprudent vehicle sales forecast and 2) a possible cut in subsidy income
        amountin FY18amid policy refinement. We also cut our FY17-19net profit forecasts by6.9-11.8% on lower margin
        assumptions for the auto business.¡£<br/><br/>
        Our SOTP-derived target prices are based on 1) a peer average FY18E P/E of 15.5x,22.4x and 7.4x for the handset
        business (18% of SOTP value), battery business(6% of SOTP value) and monorail business (2% of SOTP value),
        respectively; and 2)a peer average FY18E P/sales of 1.7x and 2.1x for the conventional auto business(12% of SOTP
        value) and the NEV business (62% of SOTP value), respectively.The implied target FY18E P/E is 29.8x, the highest
        target P/E benchmark amongits local peers, which we believe is justified by its unique exposure to China'sNEV
        market and its 37% FY17-19E two-year EPS CAGR. We maintain Buy onBYD-H on a positive earnings outlook, mainly
        driven by robust NEV demandand potential NEV battery sales to third parties. We maintain Hold on BYD-A,given the
        valuation premium to the H-shares. Key upside risks: rapid auto salesand margin improvement, driven by
        successful new models, better-than-expectedsales, and/or a margin recovery in battery and handset component
        businesses.Key downside risks: weakening in NEV sales and margin pressure.¡£</p>
