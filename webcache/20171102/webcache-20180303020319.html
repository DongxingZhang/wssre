    <p> Faster capacity expansion is the signal of an inflection point. New OrientalEducation, the leader in K-12
        education and oversea test preparation in China,increased capacity expansion guidance from 10-15% y-o-y
        previously to 20% y-o-y, Webelieve this demonstrates the company¡¯s strong confidence in current operation
        andfuture demand, and is the signal of growth accelerating, which could lead to potentialrerating opportunities,
        in our view. In 1Q, total classroom area grew 31.4% y-o-ycompared with around 10% growth in FY17. Although the
        newly added classroomscould weigh on utilization and margins in the short term, they should fuel future
        growthafter a 5-8 month ramp up period. We expect FY18 revenue to grow 33% y-o-y versusconsensus estimate of 25%
        y-o-y, on the back of faster than expected capacityexpansion and strong results from summer
        promotions.<br/><br/>
        Beat on revenue and guidance while margin slightly missed due to fasterexpansion. EDU reported solid 1QFY18
        (ended August 2017) results, with net revenuebeating HSBC/consensus estimates by 2%/3%, respectively. Its net
        revenue increased24% y-o-y to USD661m in 1Q. K12 after-school tutoring revenue grew 35% y-o-y (38% yo-y in RMB)
        in 1Q, mainly driven by a 15.6% increase in student enrolment. Note that 1Qrevenue and student enrolments have
        not factored in the results from summer promotions,but we expect summer promotions will lead to growth
        accelerating in the coming quarters.<br/><br/>
        Non-GAAP operating margin declined 390bps y-o-y to 24.8%, of which summerpromotions dragged the margin down by
        200bp and the remaining 190bps decline ismainly attributable to capex expansion, according to company estimates.
        We believe themargin will likely improve for the rest of FY18 due to increasing utilization rate. All in all,1Q
        non-GAAP net profit was 1% lower than consensus. The company guides that2QFY18 revenue will be in the range of
        USD447-461m, representing 31%-35% y-o-ygrowth, the mid-range of which is 6% greater than consensus.<br/><br/>
        Reiterate Buy rating, with a new TP of USD109. We raise our FY18-20e revenueforecasts by 3%/3%/9% on faster than
        expected capacity growth, but we cut our non-GAAP operating margin assumption by 3%/2%/1% to factor in the
        incremental cost ofcapacity expansion. All in all, we trim our FY18-19e non-GAAP net profit estimates by9%/3%
        but increase our FY20e net profit estimate by 5%. We raise our DCF-based targetprice to USD109 (was USD100),
        implying 32x FY19 ex-cash PE, against a 39% FY17-20e EPS CAGR and 33% revenue CAGR. Key downsides risks include
        failing to enhancethe utilisation rate.</p>
