    <p> Last week, the PBoC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China would grow 7.0% in2H17. This led to a strong rally in the
        copper price and also caused the 10-yeartreasury yield to break above 3.7%, a new high since 2014. Today
        Chinareleased 3Q GDP, which suggests that growth in 2H17 is unlikely to hit 7.0%.<br/><br/>
        More likely it will slow to 6.7% yoy in 2H17 vs. 6.9% in 1H17, in our view.<br/><br/>
        According to the NBS, 3Q17 GDP grew 6.8% yoy (prior: 6.9%, consensus 6.8%).<br/><br/>
        The slowdown in investment should be the main drag, as FAI decelerated 5.5%yoy in 3Q17 from 8.3% in 2Q17.
        Nominal GDP growth in 3Q17 was flat at 11.2%yoy, so earnings growth in 3Q17 should remain steady too.<br/><br/>
        Looking ahead, we believe the current up-cycle is at a late stage and weexpect a greater slowdown in 4Q17 and
        2018. Last week, the IMF raised itsgrowth forecast for China in 2018 to 6.5%, which is also the current
        marketconsensus. However, experiences over the past few years have made it clearthat consensus is more about
        retrospection than forward looking. For instance,the consensus two years ago was a prevailing pessimism on
        China¡¯s growth andthe consensus one year ago was a continued depreciation of the RMB in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Property sales continued to weaken: Today¡¯s data shows that property salessaw the first month of negative growth
        (-1.5% yoy) in Sep since March 2015.<br/><br/>
        Property investment grew 9% yoy in Sep. This is unsustainable given sales areweak now and will be even weaker in
        the future. Given President Xi¡¯s commentyesterday that ¡°houses are for living in, not for speculation,¡± we see
        almost nochance that property measures will be loosened in the next 12 months. While thecomment isn¡¯t new, to
        reiterate it at such an important meeting is highly unusual.<br/><br/>
        In September, industrial production (IP) accelerated to 6.6% yoy from 6.0% inAug. This is not too surprising as
        this year IP jumped every quarter-end. But thejump in September was much more modest compared with the past
        twoquarters. Environmental inspection also matters as the upstream sector slowsmuch faster than downstream.<br/><br/>
        No doubt that top leaders are focusing on the Party Congress now. Anyonefamiliar with China¡¯s politics would not
        expect new reform plans from theconference, which is mainly about personnel changes (Three commonquestions:
        Cycle, Currency and Party Congress). However, the market willgain a better idea this Dec when the Central
        Economic Work Conferencetake places. Our main takeaway from President Xi¡¯s speech yesterday is that hetoned down
        the growth target noticeably (link to our note). In our view, thissuggests that China¡¯s policy makers are likely
        to tolerate growth seeing anotherleg down to 5-6%, so that they have more room to fix the structural
        problems(especially debt and housing) and make growth more sustainable.<br/><br/>
        The major upside risk to our view is from the external side. Exports areimportant. They declined 7.7% in 2016
        but rose 7.6% in Jan-Aug 2017, adding1.0-1.5 percentage point to GDP growth this year. In the current global
        up-cycle,the pick-up in the Chinese economy in late 2015 led the broad global recovery,which in turn has boosted
        China¡¯s exports. Now the question for next year is,whether China¡¯s slowdown will drag on the global economy, or
        whether Chinawill be supported by the resilient external demand.</p>
