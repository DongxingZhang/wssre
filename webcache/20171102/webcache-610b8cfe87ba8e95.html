    <p> Kakao¡¯s artificial intelligence platform Kakao i has fast expanded the Kakao-led AIecosystem via partnerships
        with Korea¡¯s major conglomerates, while thecompany¡¯s major subsidiaries (Kakao Games, Kakao Bank, and Podotree)
        haveenjoyed rapid growth in enterprise value.<br/><br/>
        Although shares may correct after a recent surge, we believe the firm¡¯s value willkeep rising in the medium to
        long term, given steady growth at subsidiaries.</p>
