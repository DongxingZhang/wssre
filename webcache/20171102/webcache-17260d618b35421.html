    <p> We believe that today society is on the cusp of the autonomous age ¨C where machinesoperate physical world
        objects that previously required human brainpower and manualdexterity, all through the power of modern
        Artificial Intelligence (AI), all by themselves andwithout supervision. The first big visually noticeable
        application of this trend is likely to beAVs because of the volume of key industry stakeholders already
        involved, readying thetechnology for mass market commercialisation ¨C on a global scale (see Global autos
        ¨CDisruptive threats: Carmakers versus new entrants, 19 September 2017).<br/><br/>
        In this report we build on our previous thematic work (see Transport shock:autonomous today, virtual tomorrow,
        19 October 2016) by looking at the ingredientsof autonomous transportation, drawing parallels and lessons from
        another disruptiveforce within transport, the evolution of electric vehicles (EVs).<br/><br/>
        Adoption of AVs could be faster than expected.<br/><br/>
        Rapid modern day advances in AI technology suggest that this new method oftransportation could be adopted faster
        than many expect. Unlike the adoption of EVs,where progress has been limited (up until very recently) by battery
        capacity andassociated high costs, the adoption of AVs is unlikely to face the same restrictions.<br/><br/>
        This is because the pace of advancement in AVs is governed by computertechnology (given Moore¡¯s Law) and is
        likely to be much more rapid.<br/><br/>
        Where to look for AI exposure.<br/><br/>
        We believe that now is the time for investors to understand the wider implications from AVrollout and also the
        new ecosystem required to support its growth over the coming years.<br/><br/>
        Our Asia technology team has published a companion note called Artificial Intelligence:Chips with everything, 16
        October 2017, in which they take a deep-dive into the hardwarerequired for AI and hence AVs. We highlight four
        themes within this AV ecosystem:computer vision, AV brain, connectivity, and automobile hardware (page 2).</p>
