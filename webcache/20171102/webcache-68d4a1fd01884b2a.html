    <p> Spain¡¯s sovereign credit risk measure declined in the week ended October 13 following amessy referendum vote on
        the prospect of Catalonia seceding from Spain. The country¡¯sSovereign EDF? (Expected Default Frequency) metric1,
        which measures the expectedprobability of default over a five-year time horizon, dipped from 0.27% at the start
        of theweek to 0.24% on Thursday, before finishing the week at 0.25%. The five-year CDS spreadeased from 77 bp to
        69 bp over course of the week. The Sovereign EDF metric for Spainhas ranged between implied ratings of Baa1 and
        Baa2 over the past year, putting it closelyaligned with the Moody¡¯s Investors Service (MIS) rating of Baa2. A
        Sector Comment releaseby MIS following the referendum suggests that while the Catalan independence is unlikely,
        itwould have a broadly negative credit impact2. The agency stated that: ¡°given its significantcontribution to
        Spain's GDP, Catalonia¡¯s secession would result in the remaining Kingdomof Spain being a smaller economy with
        reduced tax-raising abilities ¡ª while still retainingsignificant credit strengths and most likely an
        investment-grade rating.¡±Spain¡¯s Sovereign EDF trend was volatile in the recent weeks as the Catalan people
        preparedto vote on independence from Spain, despite the referendum being ruled illegal by theSpanish courts. The
        Catalonian region, which consists of 7.5 million people (roughly 16% ofthe population of Spain) is an important
        powerhouse, generating nearly 20% of the country¡¯sGDP. Following the October 1 referendum, Spain¡¯s Sovereign EDF
        reached a three-monthhigh of 0.28%. However, the recent decline of the metric to 0.25% suggests that
        investorswere somewhat reassured by Catalan President Carles Puigdemont¡¯s remarks on October10, which restated
        Catalonia¡¯s right to independence followed by a decision to first allow formore ¡°dialogue¡± with leaders in
        Madrid. As shown in Exhibit 1, below, despite its volatilitycaused by the political tensions, the country¡¯s EDF
        remains well below the region¡¯s average of1.09%.</p>
