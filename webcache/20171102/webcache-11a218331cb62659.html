    <p> We reinstate coverage of SK Innovation. The company looks promising as its: 1)refining margin is on a
        longer-term uptrend; 2) chemical earnings should keepgrowing amid an expansion phase of the NCC cycle; and 3)
        shares are offeringhigher dividends while remaining attractively valued.<br/><br/>
        We recommend BUY a with a 12-month target price of KRW260,000(based on 1.17x2018P/B). The company, as an added
        bonus, has a battery business that shouldeventually benefit from EV market growth.</p>
