    <p> The US FDA¡¯s refusal to approve Intarcia Therapeutics¡¯ ITCA 650should renewmarket attention on Hanmi
        Pharmaceutical¡¯s efpeglenatide. Sanofi should disclosethe schedule for efpeglenatide¡¯s Phase III global
        trials¡ªwhich are likely to start thisquarter¡ªin its 3Q earning call on Nov 2.<br/><br/>
        We expect poziotinib, the company¡¯s potential new drug for non-small cell lungcancer, to succeed in its US Phase
        II trials.<br/><br/>
        We expect releases of results by: Spectrum Pharmaceutical for Phase III US trialsof Rolontis in 1Q18(interim);
        Eli Lilly for Phase II global trials of HM71224, Johnson&amp; Johnson for Phase I trials of
        HM12525A/JNJ-64565111, and Genentech for PhaseI clinical trials of HM95573in 2H18. We also expect Hanmi Pharm to
        sign more outlicensingcontracts in 2H18.<br/><br/>
        We maintain BUY, raise our target price to KRW580,000, and keep the stock as oursector top pick.</p>
