    <p> Our estimates have Loen Entertainment¡¯s operating profit up 35.9% y-y to an in-lineKRW28.1b in 3Q, which will
        likely owe to approximate net subscriber additions of150,000and increased promotional activities.<br/><br/>
        Music streaming services are seen representative killer apps amid expansion of thevoice UI market, which should
        prove most beneficial to Loen since it runs MelOn,Korea's top music-streaming and downloading service.<br/><br/>
        We maintain the stock at BUY and raise our 12-month target price by 20% toKRW120,000(based on 30x 2018P/E) to
        reflect upward revisions we made to itsEPS forecasts and valuation multiple. Overhang risk does linger, but we
        expect thisto be offset by solid earnings momentum.</p>
