    <p> Difficult proposition to include petrol and diesel in GST, given therevenue implications: While in spirit the
        proposal to include petrol / diesel inGST is promising and a step in the right direction, we believe that the
        revenueimplication from such a move for both the Centre and state are significant andthus do not expect such a
        move to be done in haste. Indeed, fuel taxesaccount for 32% of the central government¡¯s total indirect tax
        revenue and21% of states¡¯ indirect tax revenue.<br/><br/>
        Including petrol and diesel under the current GST peak rate would resultin revenue loss, as such a high cess
        (30-75%) would be needed to keeprevenue collections neutral: Given it is still early days with respect to
        GSTimplementation, there is not enough clarity if GST will lead to higher taxrevenues by increasing the tax net.
        In this context, the government will likelywait and watch before including petroleum products under GST or
        elseincrease the rate of tax by a higher cess (30-75%) or a higher tax slab.<br/><br/>
        The decline in oil prices added ~1% of GDP to government¡¯s revenuekitty and reduced the subsidy burden by ~0.8%
        of (GDP on budget): Indiahas benefited significantly from the decline in oil prices since 2014, which hashelped
        to improve India¡¯s terms of trade and fiscal position, as thegovernment kept a part of the decline in oil prices
        by increasing fuel exciseduties. The government¡¯s fiscal positon also improved as it deregulated fuelprices in
        Oct 2014 and reduced the burden of fuel subsidy. Indeed, fuelsubsidy declined from the peak of 1% of GDP in
        F2013 (on budget) to 0.2% ofGDP in F2017.<br/><br/>
        The recent rise in domestic pump prices to 2014 levels put pressure onthe government to reduce taxes: The recent
        increase in prices of petrol anddiesel to near 3-year high, led to an increase media scrutiny on thegovernment¡¯s
        fuel price policy. This led to the central government reducingthe excise duty by Rs 2/litre on petrol and diesel
        each (leading to revenue lossof INR 260bn annualised), followed by five state governments reducing statelevel
        VAT on petrol and diesel.<br/><br/>
        Newsflow has increased on inclusion of petrol / diesel in the GST ambit:Recently, there has been an increase in
        newsflow related to including petroland diesel under the GST ambit. Currently, petrol diesel, aviation fuel
        andnatural gas have been kept outside of the GST related taxes. However, giventhe revenue implications, we do
        not expect such a move to be done in haste.</p>
