    <p> 1. President Xi outlined a plan for China in the long term, without mentioningthe 2020 growth target as his
        predecessor did in the past . We wonder ifthis means the government may allow more flexibility in growth over
        thenext few years. We will need to wait for more signals from the CentralEconomic Working Conference in December
        and the National People'sCongress in March to confirm if that is the case.<br/><br/>
        2. President Xi's long term plan does not have a quantitative growthtarget. This is different from the plans
        from his predecessors who oftenput explicit GDP targets. Instead President Xi aims to make China"prosperous,
        democratic, civil, harmonic, and beautiful" by 2050. Wethink it is wise not to set a numerical growth target for
        the long term, as itimposes constraint on economic policies in a world with high uncertainty.<br/><br/>
        3. The speech emphasized supply side reform as the key economic policy.<br/><br/>
        President Xi mentioned that the "advanced manufacturing industry"should be further developed. Some sectors were
        mentioned as potentialnew sources for growth, including "medium and high end consumption",innovation, "green and
        low carbon" industry, sharing economy, modernsupply chain, and human capital service.<br/><br/>
        4. On SOE reform, President Xi mentioned state capital should becomestronger and larger. Effective incentives
        should be provided and the mixedownership reform should be promoted. This suggests to us the reform atChina
        Unicom may be replicated in other large SOEs in the years to come.<br/><br/>
        5. President Xi mentioned the government should "significantly promotemarket access and open up the service
        sector". This statement indicateswe may see meaningful policies on this front in 2018.<br/><br/>
        6. Environmental protection will likely become more important. PresidentXi talked about its importance several
        times in the speech. He said "weshould treat the environment as our own lives". This suggests the
        tightregulation to reduce pollution will likely continue and may become eventougher.<br/><br/>
        7. On property market, President Xi reiterated his view that "houses aremeant for people to live in, not for
        speculation". This sentence got a longapplause from the audience. He mentioned the rental market should
        bepromoted, as part of the policy framework to make the housing sectormore sustainable.</p>
