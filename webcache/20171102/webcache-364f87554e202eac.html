    <p> High on FDI: While still below most of its ASEAN peers, foreign direct investment(FDI) to the Philippines has
        steadily grown over the past three years, reaching arecord high of around USD8bn in 2016, up from just below
        USD6bn in each of theprevious two years. As such, the reasonable expectation earlier this year was for FDIto
        continue to grow, especially in light of the government¡¯s push for greaterinfrastructure spending and other
        reforms. Indeed, the Department of Trade andIndustry expected FDI to reach between USD10bn and USD11bn for 2017.<br/><br/>
        Back to reality: However, FDI to date has been far below expectations. Net FDI asof July was less than USD4bn,
        down 16.5% YTD y-o-y. More strikingly, total newequity investments (new FDI) have seemingly ¡°fallen off a cliff¡±
        and are down 81.5%YTD y-o-y. The other components of net FDI ¨C reinvested earnings and intracompanyloans from
        parent firms abroad (debt instruments) ¨C are also growing at aconsiderably slower pace than last year.<br/><br/>
        An analysis: After a closer look, however, we found that the rise in FDI in 2016 wasparticularly unusual in the
        Philippines¡¯ FDI cycle. New foreign investments historicallygrew in alternating cycles with reinvested earnings
        and debt instruments on a YTDy-o-y basis. However, 2016 was the first year that all three components of FDI
        roseconcurrently for just about the entire year. The exact reason for this is hard toidentify; however, it may
        be due to a positive outlook in the business communityleading up to the 2016 elections, after several years of
        robust growth.<br/><br/>
        Implications and solutions: The cyclical breakdown that we saw in 2016 suggeststhat we are likely to see a
        slowdown in new foreign investments for the remainder ofthe year. Moreover, any substantial increase in net FDI
        this year would have to bedriven primarily by growth in reinvested earnings and debt instruments. It is
        worthnoting, however, that the historical FDI cycle in the Philippines is not set in stone andmay be positively
        influenced by continued FDI liberalisation (see Delayed, notderailed: Philippine reforms on track: 20 September
        2017).</p>
