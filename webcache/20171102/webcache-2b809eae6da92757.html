    <p> Adjusted credit growth at 15% yoy in Sept, the same as in Aug<br/><br/>
        PBOC reported Sept new loans of Rmb1.27tr and TSF of Rmb1.82tr, bothahead of consensus. But, if adding new
        municipal bonds of Rmb356bn, theadjusted system credit growth would be 15.0% yoy, same as the prior month.In
        detail, noticeably China households are levering up quickly. We welcome thepersonal loans driven by genuine
        consumption growth, but there may be anotable portion of short-term consumer loans that were used to
        financeproperty purchases, which in our view contains higher risks. Regulatorycrackdown on property-related
        consumer loans together with monetary policystaying neutral lead us to expect slower credit growth in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        Who is borrowing? Household to lever up quickly<br/><br/>
        A breakdown by borrower suggests household and corporate sectorscontinued to lever up, making up 31%/41% of new
        system credit in Sept(35%/38% in Aug). For households, while mortgage growth had slowed, s/tretail loan growth
        accelerated to 17.6% yoy in Sept (vs. 15.8% in Aug or 7.3%in 1Q17) to make up c.10% of credit creation. We
        attribute this to both decentconsumption growth with rising credit penetration and property-relatedlending. As
        highlighted in our report Where did consumer loans go?, weestimate 1/3of new consumption loans may be used to
        finance purchases ofsecond homes. However, PBOC and local CBRC offices have started to crackdown on
        property-related consumer loans in September and we expectconsumer loan growth momentum to moderate in the
        coming months.<br/><br/>
        Who is lending? Smaller banks slowed down post financial deleveraging<br/><br/>
        China¡¯s banking assets growth further slowed to 10.9% yoy in August (vs.2016: 16.5%), mainly dragged down by
        smaller banks. Total asset growth ofjoint-stock and city/rural banks (44% of total banking assets)
        deceleratednotably to 11% yoy in August from 19% in 2016. Particularly, JSBs¡¯ assetgrowth declined to 7.6% from
        17.2% in 2016affected by financial deleveragingcampaign. Three listed JSBs reported balance sheet shrinkage in
        2Q17and weexpect some JSBs to shrink asset base further. In contrast, Big Five banks(36% of total banking
        assets) asset growth moderated slightly to 8.2% yoy inAugust (July: 9% yoy), still faster than 6.4% in Aug 2016.<br/><br/>
        Financing channel wise, shadow banking credit picked up<br/><br/>
        While loan demand were strong (13.1% yoy), shadow banking finance saw apick-up in Sept (trust loans, entrusted
        loans and undiscounted bills), whichaccounted for 22% of Sept TSF vs. 18% in 8M17. We attribute this mainly
        tomilder deleveraging pace post the completion of self-checking of CBRC regs.<br/><br/>
        Financial deleveraging to continue; credit growth likely to slow down<br/><br/>
        M2growth picked up slightly to 9.2% yoy in September from 8.9% in theprevious month, while M1growth remained
        flattish at 14.0%. With resilienteconomic conditions and financial leverage staying high, we expect the PBOCto
        maintain a neutralized monetary policy. This is evidenced by the DR007, themost important interbank rate, which
        stayed elevated within 2.8-3.1% range inSeptember and so far in October. Reflecting the unchanged monetary
        policy,we continue to prefer big banks and stay cautions on smaller ones.</p>
