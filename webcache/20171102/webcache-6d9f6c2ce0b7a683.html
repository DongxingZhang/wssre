    <p> Mild profit growth with SG&amp;A; cost control offsetting weak margin<br/><br/>
        3Q17revenue grew 9.3% YoY to RMB6.3bn. However, gross profit declined 20.5%YoY to RMB0.9bn in 3Q17with 5.6ppt
        YoY gross margin deterioration due toincreasing revenue contribution from lower margin segments such as BMS
        andADAS (auto safety and interconnection system). Together with 1) 17.2% YoY dropin SG&amp;A; expenses (SG&amp;A;
        ratio declining to 11.1% of revenue in 3Q17vs. 14.6% in3Q16) and 2) one-off disposal gain of the remaining stake
        in industrial automationbusiness, but partially offset by 43.1% YoY increase in finance cost, 3Q17netprofit
        increased by 71.1% YoY to RMB271.1m. On a 9M17basis, Joyson's netprofit of RMB886.7m was up 1.2x YoY and
        accounted for 78% of our previousfull-year FY17earnings forecasts and 75% of Bloomberg consensus. Therefore,we
        consider the results slightly above our expectation.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view - auto safety and ADAS gaining momentum<br/><br/>
        Joyson is on track to consolidate the KSS and PCC businesses acquired last year.According to the company, the
        two segments further recorded new contract winsfor active safety products and interconnection system. We raise
        our FY17-19Erevenue by 2.7-3.0% and net profit by 2.8-4.0% to reflect stronger revenue growthfrom new businesses
        and lower SG&amp;A; cost ratio, partly offset by lower grossmargin assumptions. Maintain Buy on our optimistic
        view for the growth potentialof KSS in active safety and ADAS market in China. Our TP is set at 30x FY18E
        P/E(from 27x, given the sector re-rating over the past few months), ~15% below itsmid-cycle P/E of 36x. This is
        justified, in our view, since we expect the companyto deliver a 37.5% EPS CAGR in FY16-19E. Key downside risks:
        1) weaker-thanexpectedauto sales; 2) failure to consolidate KSS/TS or improve profitability; 3)future capital
        raising to fund potential acquisitions.</p>
