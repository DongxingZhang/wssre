    <p> What do you do with a problem like India? On the one hand, it is one of thefew EMs that has some semblance of
        structural reform agenda, even thoughsometimes these reforms are not well designed or executed. India is also
        one ofthe select few major global economies able to deliver multifactor (TFP) growthrates, and hence it has
        lower reliance on financialization. India¡¯s externalvulnerabilities are relatively low and, as long as commodity
        prices and the US$remain broadly contained, this is unlikely to change. However, on the other hand,the
        conventional bugbears of excess capacity and over-leveraging within thecorporate sector and stressed banking
        sector are as pertinent as ever. Privateinvestment remains a drag while the external environment is
        insufficiently robustto kick-start faster growth rates. As a result, growth has been easing, probablyeven below
        the headline 2Q rate of 5.7% (stripping-out volatile valuables, 2Qgrowth was arguably below 5%). As the impact
        of demonetization and GSTwears off, we expect growth rates to pick-up, and public sector
        infrastructureinvestment to support the economy through the next two years. As long as theglobal environment
        remains placid, there might even be room for more rate cuts.<br/><br/>
        But it seems unlikely that the economy in the near term will grow much fasterthan 6.0-6.5% (real) and ~10%
        (nominal). A return to more robust growthrequires ungumming the banking sector and meaningful reform
        progress.<br/><br/>
        How long will equity investors remain indulgent? Despite disappointmentsvis-¨¤-vis exceptionally inflated
        expectations three years ago and a consistenttrack record of EPS under-delivery (Asia¡¯s worst downward
        revisions), investorshave been prepared to expand multiples, in expectation that a mix of global andlocal
        factors will ultimately drive faster growth. This is not unusual, as a similarprocess played-out in the past
        five years in the Philippines, another country thatuntil recently was perceived as having a structural reform
        agenda. Although wewere never comfortable with the persistent rolling of inflated EPS estimates, wefelt that the
        declining global cost of capital would be reflected in EMs, includingIndia. Despite the tightening noise,
        today¡¯s global liquidity and risk perceptionsremain exceptionally loose (here), and we maintain that global cost
        of capital ismore likely to fall than rise. If that proves to be the case, India¡¯s rates havefurther to fall,
        especially in view of recent debt issuance by more vulnerable EMs(here), thus providing valuation support.
        However, EPS estimates for ¡¯17 areindicating only 10% growth (vs. 19% six months ago) and they continue to
        belowered, while ¡®18 estimates pencil-in a strong rebound (21%), and, although thebase is low, it is hard to
        imagine further upside. Local liquidity supports equities,but foreign investors are turning sellers. The tug of
        war between macro, earningsand valuations will determine whether current negative trends strengthen.<br/><br/>
        We continue to like India, but just not as much. While we maintain that Indiais one of the more exciting global
        and regional stories, and domestic liquidity isnot just cyclical but has a strong secular component, India is
        now the mostexpensive market in Asia ex, with inflated forward estimates and an economythat we believe will take
        longer to re-adjust to monetary and GST measures thanthe current consensus anticipates. We are also strong
        believers in the LT secularstory of technology, and India is not well-suited to benefit from burgeoning
        tradedriven by tech. We have reduced our overweight in India, and relocated funds toChina and Korea (economies
        that also have low external vulnerability but strongexposure to tech) while reducing underweights in Singapore
        and Indonesia.</p>
