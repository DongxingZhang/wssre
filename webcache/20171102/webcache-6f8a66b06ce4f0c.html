    <p> Minutes of October MPC meeting released: The RBI on Wednesdayreleased the minutes of the MPC meeting held on
        October 3每4, 2017. Recall,the RBI had held key rates unchanged with a vote of 5每1, with MPC member,Dr. Dholakia,
        dissenting for a 25bp rate cut. While MPC member, Dr. Patra,voted for a pause, he reiterated again that the RBI
        may need to be preparedto hike rates based on inflation trajectory (Dr. Patra had indicated need for arate hike
        in April 2017 as well).<br/><br/>
        Upside risks to inflation: The MPC minutes highlighted that allmembers remain concerned with regard to inflation
        trajectory, especiallyas the inflation prints for July and August indicated a broad-basedincrease in prices. The
        risks to inflation as per the MPC members stemsfrom risk of fiscal slippages, risks from commodity price spikes
        and geopoliticaluncertainty. The MPC members note that inflation expectationshave moderated; however, they still
        remain elevated and the downwardadjustment remains slow.<br/><br/>
        Looking for further data to assess if slowdown in growth istransitory: The MPC members note that there is a
        slowdown in growth,especially as indicated by the GDP growth rate for QE June. However,to make a more certain
        assessment whether the slowdown in growth istransitory, the MPC is likely to wait for more data points.
        Commentsfrom Dr. Patra and Dr. Patel indicate that recent data points indicate animprovement in growth and
        growth outlook should be better in 2H FY18.<br/><br/>
        Our view: Expect one more rate cut in FY18: We believe that the RBI facesa dilemma of managing a
        weaker-than-expected growth outlook and keepingthe inflation trajectory closer to its stated medium-term target
        of 4%. In thiscontext, the RBI is likely to be data-dependant to assess the evolving growth每inflation dynamics.
        Indeed, the CPI inflation for Sep-17 was lower thanexpected and indicated steady inflation rate (which was
        released post the RBIpolicy). In our view, inflation will likely hover sub-4% in 2H FY18, and growthrecovery is
        likely to be tepid (our estimates of growth are at 6.7% in FY18,7.2% in FY19), which creates room for one more
        rate cut of 25bp 每 we expectthe RBI to likely move in the December policy review.</p>
