    <p> We now expect LG Innotek to post a 3Q operating profit of KRW55b, in line withconsensus. We believe 3D
        sensing-module supply will loosen in the near futureand optical solutions earnings will stabilize in 4Q, while
        more use of 3D sensingcameras in smartphones and increasing photomask sales from 2019should drivelong-term
        growth. We maintain BUY on the stock with a KRW185,000target.</p>
