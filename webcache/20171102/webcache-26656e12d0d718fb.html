    <p> What's new: SIPG's share price jumped 10% on October 20, on the theme of'Shanghai Free Trade Port', reported by
        Bloomberg.<br/><br/>
        SIPG's performance is supported by fundamentals: We think SIPG's recentstrong share price performance is not
        only driven by policy speculation, but alsosupported by its solid fundamentals. We expect SIPG's net profit to
        grow by over40% YoY in 2017, driven by improvement in port operations and commercialproperty business. Our 2017
        earnings forecast is 20% above consensus (see APearl on China's East Coast; Initiate at Overweight).<br/><br/>
        Read-across to China Merchants Port: We maintain OW on CMP (0144.HK), asCMP holds 25% shares in SIPG, and we
        estimate ~50% of CMP's 2017 recurringnet profit will be contributed by SIPG. In August 2013, both CMP and SIPG
        shareprices rallied on the 'Shanghai Free Trade Zone' theme, by over 20% and 45%,respectively. We expect
        positive sentiment changes if SIPG's share price continuesto perform strongly.</p>
