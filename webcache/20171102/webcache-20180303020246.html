    <p> Limited holdings: high valuations, concerns on macro and politics. Overa span of two weeks in an analyst road
        show in the US and Europe, we findthat stock ownership in the Philippines was quite limited. The most
        citedreason for staying in the sidelines was the market¡¯s premium valuation (18xPER for 2018E, higher than
        historical average and Asia/ASEAN peers) andthe perception of rising macro and political risks. The country
        shifting to acurrent account deficit was a concern for many, as well as the negativepublicity related to
        President Duterte¡¯s anti-drug and crime campaign.<br/><br/>
        Optimism may be setting in, led by earnings and potentially bettermacro news flow. Nonetheless, we felt that for
        the most part for bothcontinents that there was greater optimism after the meetings. Philippines¡¯improving
        corporate earnings picture, led by the property and consumersectors were taken positively. Likewise appreciated
        was the expectation of animproving macro related news flow forthcoming by the end of 2017 by way oftax reform
        and infrastructure roll out. Europe and US investors also becamemore constructive on their view of Philippine
        politics, especially on thebusiness side of things including foreign policy.<br/><br/>
        Europe more consumer focussed. While belonging to a minority, investorsin Europe who had Philippines exposure
        tended to focus on the consumersector. They also had less regard for liquidity as one could expect, with
        thestock most mentioned as a holding being very recent PCOMP inclusionRobinsons Retail Holdings (RRHI PM,
        P97.40, Outperform, TP: P115.00,Karisa Magpayo).<br/><br/>
        US more conglomerates and banks focussed. Likewise a minority ofinvestors in the US who had Philippines exposure
        for their part appeared togive more importance to size and liquidity. This can be seen in conglomeratesbeing
        most held, followed by banks. Country proxy Ayala Corporation (ACPM, P1,092.00, Outperform, TP: P1,075.00) and
        largest bank BDO Unibank(BDO PM, P143.50, Outperform, TP: P147.00) both figured prominently asholdings.</p>
