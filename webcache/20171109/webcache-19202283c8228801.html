    <p> Commentary for Monday: After two relatively sedate weeks of data releases andFedspeak, this week is packed with
        potential market moving events. All eyes willbe on Washington as President Trump is expected to announce his
        pick for Fedchair before leaving for a trip to Asia on Friday. Recent news flow indicates thatcurrent Fed
        Governor Jay Powell and John Taylor are the two leading candidates toreceive the nomination, though Trump has
        not necessarily ruled out reappointingcurrent chair Yellen. As we discussed in a recent Fed Note (see The case
        for Powellas Fed chair), we think there is a strong case for nominating Powell for chair ifTrump decides to not
        reappoint Yellen.<br/><br/>
        The Fed chair announcement will likely overshadow what should be an uneventfulFOMC meeting concluding on
        Wednesday. We expect no change in policy, andwith the market pricing around 85% odds of a December rate hike, we
        seelittle reason for the FOMC to either amplify or alter its message of gradualrate hikes at this week¡¯s
        meeting. Focus in the announcement will be on thediscussion in the first two paragraphs, i.e., in how the
        Committee sees recentand prospective economic developments (see What to expect from the NovemberFOMC statement
        for our full preview).<br/><br/>
        Tax reform progress will also be in focus this week. With the House giving upon deficit neutrality and adopting
        the Senate¡¯s version of the budget resolutionthat carves out $1.5tn of room for tax cuts, House Republican
        leadership aimsto release specific details on their tax reform bill on Wednesday. This will be themarket¡¯s first
        glimpse of the details of the House plan and will set the stage fornegotiations moving forward. We will be
        particularly interested in how seriousthe plan is in dealing with a number of potential political sticking
        points, includingthe overall deficit impact; removal of the state and local tax deduction; theintroduction of a
        fourth tax bracket that increases the marginal tax rate on higherincomehouseholds; and whether or not the tax
        treatment of 401(k) plans arealtered, just to name a few.<br/><br/>
        The other major highlight of the week should be Friday¡¯s October employmentreport. With September¡¯s soft CPI
        print providing a little more ammunition to the Fed¡¯s doves, employment data is crucial to the Fed¡¯s narrative
        for continuedgradual rate hikes. We are expecting a sharp rebound in payroll growth (+250kforecast vs. -33k
        previous), supported by a dissipation of hurricane effects;low jobless claims during the survey week; and robust
        supporting evidence ofsolid job growth from the ISM employment subcomponents. However, there isconsiderable
        uncertainty around this expectation. Indeed, after Hurricane Katrina,which exhibited a similar plunge in job
        growth in the September 2005 print, ittook until November 2005 for job growth to return to its earlier
        trend.<br/><br/>
        Within the other details of the report, average hourly earnings growth should slow(0.1% m-o-m vs 0.5%), which
        could lower the year-over-year growth rate to 2.6%,down from the post-crisis high of 2.9% in September. This
        retracement is dueboth to hurricane effects, which we believe boosted September average hourlyearnings growth by
        at least 4bp, as well as other statistical regularities that wehave noticed (e.g., bias tied to when the 12th
        falls within the survey week andhow many work days there are in the month) that also point to a softer
        averagehourly earnings print. We expect the unemployment rate to be unchanged (4.2%)at its lowest level since
        early 2001. Ahead of Friday¡¯s report, we may potentiallysharpen our expectations for job growth depending on ADP
        employment (+240thousand vs +136 thousand) on Wednesday.<br/><br/>
        There are a number of other key data releases this week. Today¡¯s data on corePCE inflation (0.1% m-o-m vs. 0.1%)
        and consumer spending (1.1% m-o-m vs.<br/><br/>
        0.1%) would typically be crucial for Fed expectations but will already be knownfrom last Friday¡¯s GDP report.
        Nevertheless, the details of the inflation release willbe important. On Tuesday, ahead of the FOMC meeting, we
        expect the Q3 data forthe Employment Cost Index (0.6% q-o-q vs 0.5%) to show a modest acceleration.<br/><br/>
        Growth in both total compensation and the wages and salaries componentshave been trending slowly upwards
        throughout the recovery. The ECI data tendsto be a preferred measure of wage growth for Fed officials since it
        captures abroader category of compensation and controls for various compositional shifts.<br/><br/>
        Fed officials will be looking for any confirming evidence that wage growth is infact picking up on a sustained
        basis.<br/><br/>
        Manufacturing data also gets some air time this week, with the highlight beingthe ISM Manufacturing release
        (59.0 vs 60.8) on Wednesday. The manufacturingsurveys have been strong lately, despite rig counts leveling off
        and declines inauto assemblies. As seen in the Q3 GDP numbers, growth in exports is likely onefactor supporting
        these sturdy manufacturing numbers. The new export ordersindex of the manufacturing ISM has been trending up
        over the past 2 years andis just off multi-year highs. The Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey on Monday andChicago
        PMI (59.0 vs 65.2) on Tuesday should lend supporting evidence to astrong manufacturing sector. Factory orders
        (+1.0% m-o-m vs. +1.2%) on Fridayshould also be in line with the solid recent headline durables numbers.
        Motorvehicle sales (17.5 million vs 18.5 million) on Wednesday should be back to moresustainable levels after
        September¡¯s hurricane-related replacement surge. Giventhe length of the recovery, motor vehicle sales have
        likely peaked and shouldconverge to a ¡°steady-state¡± level of around 17 million moving forward.</p>
