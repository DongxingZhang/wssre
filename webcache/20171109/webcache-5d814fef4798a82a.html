    <p> Hebei suspended explosives supply and iron ore dressing production<br/><br/>
        In early October 2017, out of environmental protection purpose, localgovernment verbally informed the majority
        of iron ore mines in Hebei province,to stop the supply of explosives to these iron ore mines and to
        suspendassociated iron ore dressing plants¡¯ production (except the iron ore minesaffiliated to state-owned large
        steel mills). According to Mysteel, thesuspension will possibly last from now until March 2018. This should
        bepositive for high grade iron ore prices (pellets, lump, 62% fines and highergrade) over heating season. Our
        Top high grade iron ore picks (BUYs) are RIO,BHP and Vale.<br/><br/>
        3-4% domestic iron ore concentrate effective supply will be impacted<br/><br/>
        According to Mysteel, Hebei province¡¯s raw ore and iron ore concentrateproduction represent c.40% and 25% of
        total national production volume,respectively. The explosives supply halt will potentially impact c.10.2mt of
        ironore concentrate production through October 2017till March 2018, implying14.3% of annualized overall iron ore
        concentrate production volume (71.5mt) inHebei province. As such, c.3-4% of national iron ore concentrate
        effectivesupply should be affected, and steel mills might need to externally procure rawmaterials to relieve the
        pressure. Nevertheless, actual duration of thesuspension remains to be seen. As we understand it, these actions
        are inaddition to the recent environmental inspections which may impact 100-150Mtof Run of Mine Chinese domestic
        iron ore production.<br/><br/>
        Who are the beneficiaries?<br/><br/>
        As China¡¯s local steel mills face instabilities for iron ore concentrates supply,this might also impact the
        stability steel products¡¯ supply; together with thewinter environmental control, steel mills out of Hebei/China
        will likely remainto be the beneficiaries. Regarding iron ore producers, this should benefit thehigh grade
        producers FXPO (100% pellets), RIO (61-62% Fe and 30% lump),BHP (61-62% Fe, 25% lump) and Vale (63-64% Fe). Note
        we recently lifted ourlump premium forecasts to US$15/t in 2018and long run to US$8/t, anddowngraded our lower
        grade 58% Fe realizations. See our recent report¡°Global Iron Ore Sector ¨C High grade to stay warm over winter
