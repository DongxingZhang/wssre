    <p> Upgrading CR Gas, also prefer BEHL and ENN<br/><br/>
        Sustainable volume growth, manageable margin risks and improving free cashflows will support the gas sector¡¯s
        growth story over 2017-19. Looking into2018, valuations are not demanding at an average 12x P/E. Specifically,
        wenow upgrade CR Gas, a high-quality laggard, to Buy, as we believe the marketunderestimates its coal-to-gas
        potential, is overly concerned about margin risksand ignores its best-among-peers balance sheet and FCFs. At
        currentvaluations, we also prefer BEHL (deeply discounted value play) and ENN (keycoal-to-gas beneficiary with
        cheap valuation).<br/><br/>
        Sustainable volume growth story supported by coal-to-gas conversions<br/><br/>
        We estimate an additional 69bcm/year volume upside from coal-to-gasconversions by 2020, contributing nearly half
        of China¡¯s total incremental gasdemand. We now expect a 15% gas volume CAGR in 2017-20E in China,achieving 10%
        energy mix by 2020. Historically, the volume growth of leadinggas players is usually 5-10ppt higher than the
        national average and we expectthe trend to continue. Besides ENN (Hebei and coastal focus) and China Gas(North
        China focus), which have been recognized by the market as key coal-togasbeneficiaries, CR Gas also looks
        well-positioned with the largest exposure(14projects) to 2+26cities and more big city projects, where
        governments aremore active and able to afford subsidies.<br/><br/>
        Margin risks manageable, winter gas shortage is a double-edged sword<br/><br/>
        In this report, we dive deeper into gas sales margin trends by analyzing fourfactors that could affect margins.
        Overall, we expect margins to trend downgradually but at a tolerable rate (Rmb4-12cents/cm over three years).
        Potentialwinter non-residential city-gate price hikes (likely 15-20%) is another round ofstress test but we
        believe the risks are manageable. On the positive side,winter gas shortage has pushed up domestic LNG prices to
        a two-year high,helping eliminate the threat from LNG direct delivery, the price advantages ofwhich have
        diminished sharply in recent months.<br/><br/>
        Rural opportunities: connection visibility vs. gas sales uncertainties<br/><br/>
        We see increasing visibility of new connection growth in rural areas due tostronger pushes from local
        government; therefore, we believe China Gasshould be able to meet its aggressive connection target. Our typical
        ruralproject model suggests a 8%/11% project IRR/equity IRR but at the same timewe notice the IRR is very
        sensitive to many moving parts, including actual gasusage, dollar margin, capex and opex, all of which is
        debatable due to lack ofmature projects as benchmark. Variance of risk appetite might explain gasdistributors¡¯
        differing attitude towards rural opportunities. We respect ChinaGas¡¯s pioneer spirit in rural areas and
        meanwhile agree with ENN and CR Gasabout their discretion and more disciplined return requirements.<br/><br/>
        Valuations and risks<br/><br/>
        We use DCF (WACC of 7.6-8.3%) and SOTP to derive target prices. Key risksinclude weaker demand growth, harsher
        margin squeeze, policy uncertainties.</p>
