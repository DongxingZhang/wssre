    <p> 8% 3Q16 net profit YoY growth on decent sales at both local brands and JVs.<br/><br/>
        SAIC Motor released 3Q17 results after the market close on 30 October. Thecompany¡¯s 3Q17 gross revenue grew
        17.4% YoY to RMB211.6bn, on the backof 11.3% growth in vehicle sales volume during the period, probably due
        toproduct mix improvement. Meanwhile, SAIC Motor¡¯s 3Q17 gross profit rose26.1% YoY to RMB29.7bn with 1.0ppt YoY
        gross profit margin improvement,possibly also due to better sales mix. Yet with a 46.7% higher selling
        expenseYoY and flat profit contribution from its JVs (despite 9.7% and 7.7% YoY salesvolume growth at SAIC
        Volkswagen and SAIC GM, respectively), 3Q17 net profitincreased only 8.1% YoY to RMB8.7bn. On a 9M17 basis, SAIC
        Motor¡¯s net profitof RMB24.6bn was up 6.7% YoY, accounting for 70% of DB's FY17 forecastand 68% of Bloomberg's
        full-year FY17 forecast. We consider the results slightlybelow expectations as nine months' net profit accounted
        for 71-72% of full-yearnet profits in the past two years.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C stable earnings growth and attractive yield in the price.<br/><br/>
        Going forward, we expect SAIC Motor's 4Q17 sales momentum to be sustainedwith year-end sales rush and further
        product mix improvement. However, wethink that extra promotional efforts will be needed to push sales amid
        intensifyingcompetition. All in all, we envision a stable earnings growth trajectory for thecompany, which
        should support its generous dividend payout. We maintain Holdon SAIC Motor because we think the current
        valuation is fair.<br/><br/>
        We raise our FY17-19 revenue forecasts marginally, by 3.7-5.2%, on higher salesvolume estimates, but trim our
        FY17-19 net profit forecasts 0.3-2.1% mainlyon lower consolidated EBIT margin assumptions. We value SAIC Motor
        at 9.5xFY18E P/E (from 9x FY18E given recent auto rector re-rating), which is above thecompany's historical
        trading average and close to the industry's long-term P/Eaverage. This is justified, in our view, as we expect
        SAIC Motor to achieve a threeyearnet profit CAGR of 7% in FY16-19. On a P/BV basis, we believe the
        company'simplied FY18E target P/BV of 1.5x is justified, considering its 16-17% sustainableROE.<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks include: 1) a weak reception for its new models from variousSAIC brands; 2) pricing pressure
        amid industry competition; and 3) worsethan-expected local brand profitability. Key upside risks include: 1)
        better-than- expected sales volume and pricing; and 2) better-than-expected local brandprofitability.</p>
