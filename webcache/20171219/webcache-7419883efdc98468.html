    <p> Following last night¡¯s 25 bps FED hike, the PBoC took the opportunity to raise theseries of short term OMO rates
        by 5 bps. The 7D reverse repo, 28 day reverse repoand 1Y MLF (medium-term lending facility) rates were all hiked
        by 5 bps, to 2.50%,2.80% and 3.25% respectively. The 5 bps rate increase this time round is much smallerthan the
        hikes in 1Q (the last time that PBoC did a wholesale OMO rate hike), when itwas 10bps each time (for a total of
        +20bps in 1Q).<br/><br/>
        It should be noted that despite these rate hikes, onshore market funding conditionremains supported going into
        the seasonally strong end-year and lunar new yeardemand period, with an estimated RMB1tn net liquidity
        injections in addition to aboutRMB300bn release from the targeted reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut of
        50bpsannounced in Sep that will take effect from 2018.<br/><br/>
        This suggests that the 5 bps rate hike move is largely symbolic than substantial, tosignal the central bank¡¯s
        policy stance of prudent and neutral remains unchanged andthat it remains determined to pursue its deleveraging
        policy and prevention of systemicrisks by pricing higher costs of funding. After the close of the Communist
        Party ofChina¡¯s National Congress on 24 Oct, the Chinese government has introduced a seriesof policy measures
        including the setting up of the State Council Financial Stability andDevelopment Committee, easing market access
        to the nation¡¯s banking, securities andinsurance sectors and tightening of regulations for wealth management
        products(WMP).<br/><br/>
        At the same time, raising domestic rates also helps to keep interest rate spread withUS rates in line, thereby
        lowering risks of capital outflows and formation of RMBdepreciation expectations.<br/><br/>
        In its statement, the PBoC said that the rates increase will narrow the gap betweenmoney-market rates and the
        open market operation (OMO) rates and is in reaction tothe US Fed rate increase a day earlier. Recently, there
        have been concerns that FEDmonetary normalization and a tax cut in the US will increase pressure on
        capitaloutflows from China. The PBoC will continue to watch policy moves in the US but rapidinterest rate
        increase in China is unlikely given slowing growth. We expect the PBoC toguide OMO rates gradually higher across
        a series of micro moves which means thatthere is likely more to come. As a result, the 1M interbank repo rate is
        now back up atthe high for the year at 5.50%.<br/><br/>
        Also worth noting is that China¡¯s 3- day annual Central Economic Work Conference willkick off next Mon (18 Dec).
        The economic plans for 2018 will likely focus on curbingfinancial risks, poverty reduction, fighting pollution
        and reform of the property market ashighlighted during the Politburo meeting last week.</p>
