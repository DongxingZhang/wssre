    <p> We are updating the Macquarie Marquee Ideas list for Asia ex Japan. Since itsinception in July 2016, the list
        has returned 57.6%, outperforming its benchmarkby 21.1%. It is notable that the long portion of the Marquee list
        has had an evenbetter return since inception (up 61.8%); the short portion has had a slightnegative impact on
        overall return. The Marquee Ideas are a list of our highestconvictionbottom-up stock picks, equal-weighted, and
        with no sector or countrybias.<br/><br/>

        and Nanya Tech) and four removals (CRCement, Ping An Insurance, Metro Pacific, and Pos Malaysia). There are
