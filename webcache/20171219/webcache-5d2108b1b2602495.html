    <p> Steel: We remain bullish on the steel sector for three main reasons that differ somewhatfrom the views of other
        market watchers.<br/><br/>
        First, we believe China¡¯s steel demand will surpass expectations. Despite concerns over areal estate market
        downturn, steel supply-demand dynamics should turn out better thanthe market expects, thanks to a soft landing
        for real estate, increased infrastructureinvestment, and steel industry restructuring.<br/><br/>
        Second, steel spreads have begun to improve structurally¡ªand this should continuebecause steel supply growth has
        been decoupling from iron supply growth since 2014, andsteel prices been stable relative to iron ore
        prices.<br/><br/>
        Third, steelmakers may manage to effect cost-push product price hikes early next yearjudging from Chinese
        miners¡¯ cash costs (around USD60/tonne) and rising inflationexpectations amid a global economic
        recovery.<br/><br/>
        Nonferrous metals: We forecast that base metal price movements will stay positivenext year, supported by global
        economic growth, increasing capex by manufacturers, andgreater infrastructure investments in major economies.
        The magnitude of differences inmetal price movements should hinge on each metal¡¯s supply. Although zinc, lead,
        andcopper prices are at 70% the level of their all-time highs after rallying over the past coupleof years,
        demand should remain solid overall, so prices should at least stay stable.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining OVERWEIGHT: The steel and nonferrous metals sector is cyclical. Webelieve sector earnings and share
        prices will keep trending up based on solid economicgrowth worldwide. Our top pick is Posco, which stands to
        benefit the most fromimprovements in industry conditions. Hyundai Steel may not benefit as much, butinvestors
        need to keep in mind its attractive valuation. Among small caps, we like SeahSteel as the release of a key
        report in the US Commerce Department¡¯s Section 232investigation into steel imports in January should dispel
        uncertainties for the steelmakerand enable investors to focus more on its fundamentals.</p>
