    <p> Commentary for Monday: With most everyone else downshifting into the lastcouple weeks of the year, Washington
        remains the exception. While there areno Fed speeches scheduled this week, a final vote on the tax reform bill
        seemslikely in both houses of Congress on Monday and Tuesday. Given Doug Jones¡¯s(D-Alabama) win in last week¡¯s
        special election, Republican leadership has apowerful incentive to get the bill passed before he is seated. Some
        details ofthe bill that have been made public include a 21% corporate tax rate, up from20% in previous versions
        of the reform; expansion of the maximum $10,000deduction for property taxes to include state and local income
        taxes as well; anda lowering of the top personal marginal tax rate from 39.6% to 37%. While thepassage of the
        bill remains likely, potential remaining holdouts and health issuesfacing Senators McCain (R-Arizona) and
        Cochrane (R-Mississippi) present risks,given the two vote margin in the Senate. In addition, the continuing
        resolutionfor government funding expires Friday, and there will likely have to be somecompromise increasing
        funding for non-defense spending in order to keep thelights on. While we still think the risk of a government
        shutdown is small, it isworth keeping tabs on.<br/><br/>
        Given last week¡¯s rate increase in the face of a soft November core CPI reading,the PCE data on Friday will
        likely be the most important data this week. We expectcore PCE inflation (0.1% vs 0.2% previously) to moderate
        slightly off of October¡¯sstrong print, given the soft core CPI combined with the firmer healthcare servicesPPI.
        A print in line with our forecast would bring the year-on-year number upabout 6bps from October¡¯s 1.45%. The six
        month annualized change would showa similar increase over October, which would present solid evidence that
        inflationis showing signs of firming.</p>
