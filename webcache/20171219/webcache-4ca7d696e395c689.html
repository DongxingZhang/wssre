    <p> On 16 Dec 2017, ten ministries jointly issued a notice on Five Year Plan(2017-2021) for Clean Heating in North
        China which covers 14 whole provincesand part of Henan. In this notice, the government sets several key targets:
        1) theclean heating penetration to reach 50% by 2019 and 70% by 2021 (from 34% in2016) in North China, with a
        key focus on those 2+26 cities located in pollutionchannel; 2) coal-to-gas to bring 23bcm/year incremental
        natural gas demand in2+26 cities, 63%/37% of which is in urban/rural area, 3) to install an additional12mn
        hanging space heaters in 2+26 cities and surrounding area over 2017-2021,which translates into 11-12mn rural new
        connections.<br/><br/>
        Coal-to-gas is still a key focus.<br/><br/>
        The government continues to encourage coal-to-gas conversions in North Chinaalthough at the same time stressing
        to develop in an orderly manner dependingon gas supply abundance. Centralized heating (gas-fired heating
        boilers, cogenerationgas power plants and distributed energy projects) is prioritized inurban/suburban area
        while hanging space heaters are encouraged in rural.<br/><br/>
        districts. Other than natural gas, renewable energy (geothermal, biomass, solar),power and clean coal are also
        encouraged as other methods of clean heating.<br/><br/>
        Pushes are stronger and visibility is higher in city area than suburban/ruralAccording to the notice, for
        city/county area, gas boilers/co-gen power plantsare prioritized choice for heating; for suburban area, using
        piped gas/CNG/LNGas source for centralized/individual heating is also strongly encouraged; for ruralarea, gas
        hanging furnaces should be actively promoted and the conversionprogress will depend on the economy and
        affordability in that region. Governmentexpects coal-to-gas to bring Incremental gas demand of 23bcm/year in
        2+26cities over 2017-2021, 63%/37% of which is in urban/rural area. Government alsotargets to install 12mn wall
        hanging furnaces in 2+26 cities and surrounding area,which translates into 11-12mn rural new connections. For
        regions outside of 2+26cities, the notice does not set any concrete coal-to-gas targets.<br/><br/>
        Gas supply security is reiterated.<br/><br/>
        The notice has an detailed appendix to lay out the plan to increase gas supplyto deal with the increasing gas
        demand seasonality caused by coal-to-gasconversion. Based on the plan, upstream players should be able to
        supply106bcm/year to six key provinces in North China by 2021, 60% of whichshould be in winter. The construction
        of LNG terminals/transmission pipelines/storage facilities will be accelerated and we believe Kunlun and BEHL
        are keybeneficiaries due to exposure to those assets (see report link).</p>
