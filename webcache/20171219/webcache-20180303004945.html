    <p> US likely to ease net neutrality rules, not kill them: The US FederalCommunications Commission will today vote
        on whether to dismantle landmarkregulations that ensure equal access to the internet. There is little doubt that
        thecommission will repeal the rules, because three of the five committee members areRepublicans, whose party is
        hostile to the existing net neutrality rules. This issue hasprompted some to voice concerns about undoing the
        rules completely, but that is not thegoal of the proponents of repeal. Rather, the Trump administration aims to
        achieve netneutrality under a more voluntarily regulated environment and ease some regulations soas to encourage
        investments in networks.<br/><br/>
        Implications for Korean telcos: Obviously, Korea is a sovereign state with its ownposition on net neutrality.
        Still, authorities here may take a cue from the USS FCC¡¯s move.<br/><br/>
        In fact, the Korean government already has a less stringent stance on net neutrality. Forinstance, in September
        it permitted zero-rating¡ªthe practice of not charging customersfor data usage on specific websites or for
        specific services offered by internet serviceproviders and mobile service providers¡ªsaying it would devise
        regulations ex post. It alsoallows telcos to offer internet services (eg, mobile IPTV and online music
        streaming)combined with tariff plans. With 5G investments becoming more visible in Korea, a USdecision to repeal
        rules would only augur well for Korean telcos¡¯ autonomy.<br/><br/>
        Positive for telcos in medium to long term: More-relaxed net neutrality ruleswould no doubt benefit telcos, but
        it seems a stretch to argue that charging users for netusage would immediately boost telcos¡¯ earnings and weaken
        the investment capability ofinternet firms. Rather, we believe telcos will have more leeway to launch diverse
        productsand services (eg, zero-rating or priority-traffic control services), thus generating addedvalue.
        Moreover, telcos are likely to play a more critical role in new business models (suchas the IoT), boding well
        for their longer-term business outlook.<br/><br/>
        Regulatory risk waning for domestic telcos: The easing of net neutrality ruleswould, no doubt, benefit telcos.
        But for Korean players, the more important issue is thegovernment¡¯s tariff regulations. We believe regulatory
        uncertainty¡ªeg, regardinguniversal tariff plans¡ªis fading (though tariff cuts may expand to low-income seniors).
        Itseems unlikely that an ad hoc government entity (which will exist only until Feb 2018)created to discuss
        household telecom tariff-related policy will produce detailed measures.<br/><br/>
        In short, regulatory uncertainty that reared its head in August appears to be fading.</p>
