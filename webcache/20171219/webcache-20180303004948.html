    <p> The Central Bank of Republic of Turkey hiked its second upper band (lateliquidity window) by 50bps (to 12.75%),
        versus to market positioning for 100bps(DB: 125bps), while keeping all other rates unchanged.<br/><br/>
        The short statement was slightly amended to take the latest macro outturn intoconsideration. On the growth
        front, the Bank acknowledges strong economicactivity and rapid credit growth during the course of 2017, and
        points to acontinuation of such trend in the latest data. Interestingly, the Bank's longstandingreference to
        structural reforms - i.e. 'that their implementation wouldsignificantly contribute to the potential growth' - is
        now dropped. After havingseen the remarkable 11.1%YoY GDP growth during Q3, the authorities perhapsnow deem 'the
        Credit Guarantee Fund' as one of the key structural reforms. Oninflation, the MPC points to the elevated levels
        seen in CPI and recent adverseimpact from cost-push factors (i.e. TRY weakness, higher oil and food
        prices),which led to rising risks on pricing behaviour and inflation expectations, hencethe rationale behind
        slight tightening in policy stance, in a la Turca terms.Forward-looking bits of the statement remain intact. The
        Bank still commits tomaintaining a tight policy stance 'in a decisive manner' until the inflation
        outlookdisplays significant improvement and 'becomes consistent with the targets'. Likein October, the MPC keeps
        the door open for further tightening, if need be. Thenext rate decision will be on January 18th.</p>
