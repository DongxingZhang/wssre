        converted to eco-friendly fuel. The nation¡¯s LNGpower generation is set to rise from 37.4GW this year to 44.3GW
        in 2030, while newrenewable energy source power generation is slated to rise from 11.3GW to 58.5GWover the same
        period, with the latter to include respective contributions of 33.5GW and17.7GW from solar and wind.Electricity
        tariffs: The latest plan will adjust industrial electricity rates according totime of day from next year and
        revises up tariffs for the low usage time slot of 23:00-09:00. Meanwhile, a proposal to expand tariff plans
