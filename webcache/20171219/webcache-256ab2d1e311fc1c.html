    <p> Gas shortage spreads across China<br/><br/>
        The aggressive "coal to gas" (CTG) conversions in China have significantly boostedgas demand, particularly in
        Beijing and the surrounding area; governments needto divert gas from other provinces, causing regional gas
        shortages. The FinancialTimes reported on Dec 13that the Sichuan and Chongqing governments askedchemical-makers
        to reduce or halt production until Mar 2018. In Northern China,gas supply for industrial usage has been cut and
        limited, in order to satisfyresidential usage first, while some regions do not have adequate gas supply
        forresidential use even after the cut. This pushed up the LNG price to a new high;<br/><br/>
        in Daqing and Heilongjiang even the spotted LNG price recorded RMB9,000/t inDec, almost tripling from Sep. Thus,
        NDRC / NEA has stepped in to regulate thegas price and supply allocation for SOE suppliers; however, we see the
        strong gasprice continuing due to the gas shortage.<br/><br/>
        Tight situation to continue through winter unless there's a change in storageChina¡¯s Ministry of Environmental
        Protection issued an urgent notice last weekthat those regions among the "2+26" cities that have not completed
        CTGconversions can continue to use coal and the usual fuels for heating. Thiswould temporarily cool the
        government's ambition on CTG conversion intensity.Conversely, the gas storage issue will not be solved in the
        near-term and wouldintensify efforts in gas storage development. The medium-term implications couldbe: 1)
        increasing of gas supply / production capability; 2) capex on gas storagedevelopment; 3) potential slowdown in
        CTG conversion ambitions.<br/><br/>
        Positive for upstream gas supplier - PetroChina<br/><br/>
        PetroChina (PTR) is the key beneficiary of gas price hikes during the winterheating season, as it is China's
        largest gas supplier with 67% market share, and40% of E&amp;P; production is gas. Hence, the gas price hike
        improves upstreamprofitability and narrows its import gas loss. We derive our target price for PTR viaa
        sum-of-the-parts valuation. We value the upstream segment and the midstreampipeline segment using DCF and the
        downstream segments with P/B vs. ROEmethodology. We rate it Hold with a target price of HK$5.55. Risks: oil
        &amp; gasprices, refining &amp; chemical spreads, and policy changes.<br/><br/>
        China BlueChem key beneficiary of urea &amp; methanol price spike<br/><br/>
        China urea / methanol prices have climbed above RMB1,800/ton / RMB2600/ton,by 8% / 40% since the end of June.
        Gas-based urea / methanol are at the top-endof the industry cost curve which equals c. 20%/ 10% of capacity in
        China. Withgas shortage and feedstock price hikes, we see cost push and falling production</p>
