    <p> According to recent news flow, the winter gas shortage has spread from NorthChina to the whole nation with many
        places reporting a supply-demand gap of10-20%. As a result, PetroChina increased piped gas city-gate prices for
        15-20%in this winter (in line with our expectation in last sector report) and domesticLNG price have more than
        doubled from that in the summer (much higher thanour/market expectations). We believe Kunlun/BEHL is a net
        beneficiary of wintergas shortage due to their exposure in transmission pipeline/LNG terminal/storagefacilities.
        Gas distributors may see slight margin pressures in this winter but wethink the risks are manageable.<br/><br/>
        Positive to ShaanJing pipelines and storage facilities, Kunlun/BEHL benefits<br/><br/>
        ShaanJing pipelines (60/40% owned by Kunlun/BEHL) mainly transports gas toNorth China where demand growth shows
        strongest momentum. In 11M17, itrecorded a 13% yoy transmission volume growth and we expect it to remainrobust,
        as the pipeline IV with a capacity of 15bcm/year (vs. existing 35bcm/year)has become operational in early Dec
        2017. As the coal-to-gas coversion intensifiesthe demand seasonality, we expect more processing volume and
        governmentsupports for storage facilities, which is positive to Kunlun/BEHL as they alsooperate some storage
        facilities associated with ShaanJing pipeline system.<br/><br/>
        Positive to LNG terminal and LNG processing plants, Kunlun benefits<br/><br/>
        In 10M17, China's LNG import volume surged by 48% yoy and PetroChina's threeterminal (all under kunlun now after
        asset injection, see report) recorded a muchstronger volume growth of 143% yoy based on Customs data. All of the
        threeLNG terminals have expanded the capacity and the utilization was 31-64% in10M17which still leaves further
        room to grow. In 2018, PetroChina's 3.0mtpa (vs.existing 7.3mtpa) take-or-pay contract with Russia's Yamel LNG
        project will beexecuted, providing further support to terminal utilization. Besides, Kunlun alsohas c.15% market
        share in China's LNG processing plants whose ex-factory priceshave reached a 3-year high at Rmb7000/ton on
        average, more than doubled fromRmb3,000/ton in this summer. This segment reported a net loss of Rmb0.4bn
        in1H17and we expect it to be around breakeven in 2H17with significant marginincrease offset by lower volume due
        to gas shortage.</p>
