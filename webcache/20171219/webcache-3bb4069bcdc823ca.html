    <p> Profit taking in Brazilian discretionary continued<br/><br/>
        In November, just 39% of our covered stocks showed positive returns and 54%outperformed their respective
        indices. A few Mexican stocks (AC, KIMBERA,WALMEX and SORIANAB) showed moderate (single-digit) gains thanks
        topositive earnings surprises, as did Brazil-based global protein giant JBSS3. Profittaking continued for
        Brazilian retailers BTOW3, ARZZ3, HGTX3and LAME4,while a closer-than-expected first-round election result in
        Chile led to double-digitdeclines in most of the Chilean names in our coverage (except for VCO, which ismostly
        export-oriented). Year to date, the LatAm Food and HPC subsectors aretrailing their respective country indices
        by 27% and 4% (respectively) on average,while Beverages remain roughly in-line. Retailers continue to outperform
        (by 6%on average), but by a much lower margin than last month (YTD outperformanceas of 31October was 12%),
        suggesting that investors continue to move into moredefensive positions as 2017comes to a close.<br/><br/>
        FEMSA undervaluation versus parts largely corrected<br/><br/>
        In last month's issue, we highlighted that the gap between FMX's value and thatof the parts had opened
        substantially during the prior month, from just under $1billion (equivalent to $2.68/ADS, or roughly 3%) to
        $3.1billion (equivalent to 8.81/ADS, or roughly 10%). As illustrated in Figure 40(p. 25) this value gap has
        nowreturned to more normal levels. We continue to have a Buy rating on FMX (basedon our earnings outlook), but
        we no longer think it is mispriced versus the parts.<br/><br/>
        Liverpool shares now at 5-year lows<br/><br/>
        LIVEPOLC1.MX is now trading at one- and five-year lows and has fallen 30% sinceits most recent peak (9August)
        versus a 6% decline in Mexico's IPC index, on theback of what we consider to be exaggerated concerns about
        Amazon's entry intothe Mexican market. Liverpool's 3Q17results have also been a source of concern(on rising NPLs
        and other issues related to the September earthquake), but in ourview 4Q17results should go a long way to
        erasing those concerns. As a result,we reiterate our Buy Rating on LIVEPOLC1.</p>
