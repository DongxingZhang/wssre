    <p> High growth of mid-cap stocks to regain market favor Due to expectations for neutralliquidity conditions, we
        will still see opportunities from just certain sectors in 2018 (asopposed to an across-the-board market rally).
        With the peaking and subsequent slightdecline in interest rates, lower discount rates will favor mid-cap stocks,
        which have fasterearnings growth compared with their relatively high valuations. As such, we expect shareprice
        outperformance to extend from large-cap sector leaders to mid-cap leaders in theircorresponding
        sub-sectors.<br/><br/>
        Liquidity to determine the structural trend of the A-share market China fundsoutstanding for foreign exchange
        and credit financing growth are set to remain stable,while still relatively high real interest rates and the
        relatively weak wealth effect of the Asharemarket will stop household savings from flooding the stock market.
        Besides,increasing investment returns have led to a rise in long-term financing needs fromcompanies. Considering
        the limited increase in liquidity, Chinese households prefer lowrisk money market instruments to high-risk
        equity products.<br/><br/>
        A-share earnings growth to slow; interest rates will fall after peaking We expectearnings growth for A-shares
        and A-shares ex-financials of 8% and 15% respectively in2018, while ROE will decline slightly given lower sales
        margins and asset turnover ratios.<br/><br/>
        Inflation will rise and then fall, seesawing around 2.4%. Interest rates will remain highgiven tightened
        financial deleveraging, but should decline slightly with the announcementof detailed financial supervision
        policies around 2Q18. As regulation will be more marketdriven going forward, risk appetite in the A-share market
        is set to improve slightly.<br/><br/>
        Slightly lower discount rate favors the ※growth premium§ of mid-caps In 2017,investors favored large cap stocks
        with high earnings certainty rather than high growthmid-to-small cap stocks. However, mid-cap stocks are now
        more attractive given their44.3% earnings growth in 9M17 and 26.5x P/E valuation, compared with just
        11.6%earnings growth and 12.7x P/E for large-cap sector leaders. We believe mid-cap stocks(market cap of
        Rmb20-70bn) will outperform together with large-cap industry leaders in2018 given lower discount
        rates.<br/><br/>
        Sector allocation We favor sectors that are optimizing existing capacity (technologicalupgrades - professional
        equipment, electronic equipment and transportation equipment;lowering financial risks 每 property and financials)
        and increasing the quality of theirproducts/services (high-end capacity expansion 每 midstream manufacturing;
        ※beautifullife§ consumption upgrade 每 retail, healthcare).<br/><br/>
        Themes 1) Deleveraging 每 property leasing, 2) genuine technological innovations 每 AI,fintech, advanced
        manufacturing, healthcare, OLED, new energy/new energy vehicles,5G technology.<br/><br/>
        Risks Unexpected inflation pickup leading to monetary policy change; rising interest ratesdue to continued
        stringent financial supervision.</p>
