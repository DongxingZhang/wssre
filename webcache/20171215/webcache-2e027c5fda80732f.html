    <p> GDP growth in Turkey accelerated markedly to 11.1% (unadjusted) in Q32017 compared to 5.4% previously (revised
        up from 5.1%). Sequential growth,however, surprised to the downside at 1.2% (seasonally and working-dayadjusted)
        after 2.2% in the preceding quarter, hinting that additional working daysduring Q3 2017 as well as low base from
        same period last year were both at playbehind the remarkable double-digit growth in July-September
        period.<br/><br/>
        Details reveal domestic absorption was still the main driver. Private consumptionroared by 11.7%YoY and added 7
        percentage points (pp) to the headline -versus 1.9pp in the preceding quarter. Spending on durable goods jumped
        over31%YoY, pointing to impact of temporary tax relief on white goods and furnitureon top of accommodative base
        effects. Government spending turned negativein sequential terms (-2.1%QoQ, swda), yet still managed to add 0.3pp
        to theannual headline. Fixed investments were strong again (12.4%YoY), and accountedfor 3.6pp of the annual
        headline. This time both construction (12%YoY) andmachinery &amp; equipment (15.3%) were robust thanks to the
        Credit Guarantee Fundand nationwide campaigns on residential investments. Annual growth in exports(17.2%)
        strengthened further on the back of weak TRY in real terms, improvedEuropean demand and low base. Import growth
        displayed a marked reboundto 14.5%YoY due to stronger domestic absorption. Accordingly, net exports'contribution
        to the headline growth remained positive albeit only marginally at0.3pp. Inventory depletion remained as a drag,
        having deducted 0.2 from theannual growth.</p>
