    <p> Meager auto sales growth for 2017is almost for certain<br/><br/>
        Chinese passenger vehicle (PV) wholesale volume remained flattish in November,in line with our expectation, with
        still a healthy inventory situation. We believethere will be a limited variation to our 2.0% 2017China PV sales
        growth forecast,even considering potential last-minute purchases before the year-end expiry of taxcut stimulus.
        Our preferred OEM names are BAIC Motor and Brilliance on highercertainty in their key brands' 2018E sales
        strength.<br/><br/>
        No November YoY wholesale growth on high base<br/><br/>
        Based on China Association of Automobile Manufacturers' (CAAM) Novembersales data, SUV sales were up 8.9% YoY
        (accounting for 42.8% of China PV sales).As local brands' November SUV sales made up for 63.5% of total SUV
        sales,overall local brand sales recorded a 5.0% YoY increase. Although the sub-1.6L PVsegment recorded 2.0% YoY
        sales volume drop in November, there was a 10.0%MoM sales increase, implying a continuation of last-minute
        purchase demand,in our view. Meanwhile, above-1.6L PV wholesale sales improved 4.8% YoY inNovember, on our
        estimates, probably driven by decent premium brand salesamid the Chinese consumption upgrade.<br/><br/>
        Inventory expectation staying optimistic and easing pricing pressure<br/><br/>
        The China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) reported that the Octoberdealer inventory index eased MoM to
        1.33months, and its November inventoryalert index is at 49.8%, implying dealers' continual optimism. A healthy
        demandsupplysituation is also reflected in slightly lower discounts in recent months.Although the China
        Passenger Car Association (CPCA) and WAYS forecast thatDecember mainstream PV (i.e., excluding mini-car)
        wholesale volume will grow6.4%, we are less upbeat considering the high December 2016sales base.<br/><br/>
        We prefer premium auto and Korean brands' recovery themes<br/><br/>
        We use P/E to value auto OEMs and base our target prices for auto dealers onDCF analysis. Our OEM preferred
        names are BAIC Motor and Brilliance, givenstrong sales at their premium JV brands, while BAIC Motor will also
        benefit fromits Hyundai JV recovery. Sector upside/downside risks: a sudden rise/drop in salesand inventory
        levels (see p.5for details).</p>
