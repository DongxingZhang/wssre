    <p> Conclusion<br/><br/>
        NetEase¡¯s Wilderness, its most popular survival shooter mobile game,achieved 100m registered users last week. We
        believe that this suggests it¡¯swell-positioned to benefit from the recent popularity of survival shooter
        games,which is rooted in the PC game PlayerUnknowns¡¯ Battleground (PUBG). Webelieve the next thing to watch is
        the sustainability of these games¡¯ popularityafter Tencent¡¯s launch of two PUBG mobile games. See our sector
        report CanTencent win back the chicken dinner? As long as the popularity of Wildernesscan be maintained, we
        believe NetEase will be able to monetize these games.Reiterate Outperform.Impact<br/><br/>
        What does 100m users mean? Thanks to the early mover advantage,NetEase¡¯s two survival shooter games have gained
        the greatest traction so farin China and worldwide. Its Wilderness achieved 100m registered users as
        of5December, making it the fastest Chinese game to reach that milestone(even faster than Tencent¡¯s flagship
        mobile game Honour of Kings). Thatmeans that almost one out of five Chinese mobile gamers have registered
        thisgame, two months after its introduction. NetEase¡¯s Terminator 2, in the samegenre, also topped No1download
        rank in seven countries including US, thesecond-largest PUBG market.<br/><br/>
        What to watch next? 1) Competition from Tencent, which has two PUBGmobile games in the pipeline (see trailers
        here and here). Essentially thefaster these two games can be launched, the greater the impact it will have
        onNetEase, which in turn will influence NetEase¡¯s 2) ability to monetize thisgenre, e.g. by selling gear (more
        to showcase, rather than disrupt the fairnessof the game), placement marketing, etc.<br/><br/>
        What to expect at the game event on 17December? NetEase¡¯s annualgame event generally demonstrates the latest
        progress at each of its studios.We expect some updates on its upcoming titles such as a MOBA game basedon
        Onmyoji IP, Chu Liu Xiang and Tribes and Empires. The upside may comefrom any announcement of its monetization
        strategy on its survival shootergames.Earnings and target price revision<br/><br/>
        No change. We will revisit our forecasts once there is more visibility on theplans to monetize the games.Price

        Reiterate Outperform. The most likely scenario in our view is for NetEase tobenefit upfront from the survival
        shooter boom. How long that can besustained will depend on the launch timing and feedback of Tencent¡¯s twoPUBG
        mobile games.</p>
