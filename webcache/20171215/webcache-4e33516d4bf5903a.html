    <p> Our outlook for 2018 is brighter for emerging economies and less so for emergingmarkets. A synchronized global
        growth is supportive of EM, but narrowinggaps and tightening liquidity conditions globally pose the main
        headwinds foremerging markets.<br/><br/>
        We expect EM growth to remain supportive, with Asia¡¯s cycle most advanced andLatAm playing catch-up. In Asia, a
        number of CBs are already hiking. LatAm¡¯smacro outlook will improve the most, in our view - growth is picking up
        whileCB¡¯s still have room to ease.<br/><br/>
        In Asia, with the output gap closed, risks to inflation have tilted to the upside.<br/><br/>
        As the region¡¯s monetary policy shifts towards explicit tightening, although muchless than the Fed, its fiscal
        policy is likely to turn expansionary, with the exceptionof China.<br/><br/>
        In a number of countries CBs still have room to cut or maintain supportive stanceeven as growth recovers. We see
        Brazil, Russia, Egypt, cutting rates into stronger2018 growth.<br/><br/>
        We expect EM specifics to play a more important role in 2018, with a strongfocus on politics. A heavy political
        calendar can bring unproven or off-centergovernment in Brazil and Mexico. In South Africa, Russia and Turkey
        politicswill be as important as macro. Also to monitor are geo-politics in South Korea,elections cycles in
        India, Indonesia, and Colombia. Finally, event risks are highestin Venezuela on possibly the biggest debt
        default in EM history ¨C largely priced,however.</p>
