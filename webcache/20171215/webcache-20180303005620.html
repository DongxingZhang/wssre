    <p> The Hong Kong stock market consolidation continued, as investors took profit on those high flyers in 2017 like
        Geely (#175), handset component players like Sunny Optical (#2382) and selected PRC property developers like
        Country Garden (#2007). Selling pressure on HK property developers ahead of the FOMC meeting next week dragged
        on the blue-chip index. The Hang Seng Index finally staged a long-expected meaningful rebound on Friday, after
        the blue-chip index found technical support near the 100-day moving average near 28,100 on Thursday. Over the
        week, the HSI fell 434.39 points or 1.49% to 28,639.85, while the HSCEI dropped 1.40% to 11,289.57. The average
        daily Mainboard turnover eased to HK$121.9 billion from HK$131.0 billion in the previous week.<br/><br/>
        Volatility in the local bourse exaggerated during the week. The HSI tumbled by more than 600 points on
        Wednesday, which marked the biggest daily index-point loss in nearly two years. Profit taking, temporary
        slowdown in southbound Stock Connect inflow as well as fear for short-term monetary tightening on the Mainland
        were among the drivers behind the market correction. The newly listed stocks like China Literature (#772) (-5.6%
        w-o-w) and Yixin (#2848) (-14.1% w-o-w) were also under severe selling pressure. On the economic front, China
        reported its November trade data, which showed exports grew strongly by 10.3% (in RMB terms) last month, much
        stronger than the 6% rise in October and market expectation of a 2% growth.<br/><br/>
        For the coming week, investors will keep eyes on the next FOMC meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. The Fed is
        expected to hike fed funds rate target by 25 basis points to 1.25%-1.5% after the meeting and set out the
        monetary policy outlook for 2018. Meanwhile, investors will also closely monitor the annual Central Economic
        Work Conference held by the State Council in China before the year-end. The conference is expected to outline
        major economic goals like GDP target growth for next year.</p>
