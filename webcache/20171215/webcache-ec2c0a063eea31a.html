        details of its integration strategy with Alibaba. Separately,Tencent is reported to be investing into Yonghui's
        Super Species and willaccelerate its expansion to compete with Hema Fresh. We have analyzed theopportunities for

        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        We have a Buy recommendation on both companies due to the upside fromtheir respective new retail strategies. Our
        primary valuation methodology is DCF,employing a WACC of 9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 2.0%, which is
        withinthe range that we use for Chinese consumer companies (1.0-2.5%). We use theDeutsche Bank China COE of
        9.5%, which is in line with other retailers in China.<br/><br/>
        We use a beta of 1.0. Downside risks: 1) weak SSSG; 2) slower-than-expectedexpansion plans; 3) improvement in
        GPM failing to offset an opex increase; and4) competition from e-commerce and offline peers.</p>
