    <p> Growth Finally Rebounded In 3Q17<br/><br/>
        South Korea¡¯s 3Q GDP growth wasrevised higher to 3.8% y/y from prelim3.6%, recovering from the anemic
        growthtrend since 2H16. The recovery wasbroad-based with growth in the first threequarters of the year at 3.1%
        y/y. We nowforecast 2017and 2018GDP growth at3.2% and 3.0% respectively.<br/><br/>
        Private consumption is expected tobecome a bigger growth driver, boostedby the government¡¯s jobs creation
        andwelfare programmes and as higherminimum wages set in next year (up 16%)affecting about 12% of South
        Koreanworkers. The improvement in relationswith China is another reason for the moreoptimistic economic outlook.
        Chinesetourist arrivals to South Korea dropped by24% y/y in Jan-Oct, suffering the brunt ofthe fallout due to
        the THAAD deploymentin South Korea though exports to Chinawas unaffected. China remains SouthKorea¡¯s largest
        export market accountingfor 24% of the country¡¯s export during thesame period.<br/><br/>
        South Korea¡¯s total export growth hadmoderated to 8.4% y/y in Oct-Nov from24.0% in 3Q17. As high base effect
        kicksin, export growth is expected to weakenin 2018though the extension of the techcycle into early 2018should
        still supportoutlook.</p>
