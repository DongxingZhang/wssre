    <p> Last week¡¯s (Wed-Wed) review of funds¡¯ in/outflows as % of funds¡¯ AuM.<br/><br/>
        Despite the rising yield environment going into 2018, investors poured substantialmoney into total bond funds as
        they scaled to a three-month high of inflows lastweek. The majority of inflows originated in developed markets,
        with US bondfunds garnering a ten-week high of inflows, but EM bond funds also managed tobuild on last year's
        strong run. In more detail, high-yield bond funds snapped outof their nine-week outflow streak (the longest
        since early 2008) and given theirrelationship with the oil price, and with the Fed rate hike out of the way for
        atleast a couple of months, could gain further (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, funds thatbuy inflation-protected
        bonds attracted the 11th straight week of positive flows,the longest in more than a year.<br/><br/>
        On the equity side, and with US equity indices hitting new highs every day, fundinvestors seem to take a moment
        of reflection, as US equity funds suffered heftyweekly redemptions (the second highest in nine months, only
        topped by theoutflows two weeks prior), while rotating into global equity fund mandates andemerging markets.
        Meanwhile, European equity funds snapped out of four weeksof redemptions. However on a relative basis, and based
        on our macro surpriseprojections, we believe the downtrend for Europe relative to US flows has furtherto go
        before rebounding into early Q2(see Fig. 2). For our 2017review and our2018fund flow outlook, please see our
        "Wrapping up" report from December .</p>
