    <p> Sector outlook positive in 2018 on record FCF, capital returns and macro.<br/><br/>
        After a 2yr recovery in commodity prices and sector re-rate we see the sectoras fairly valued on a P/NPV basis
        (at 1x). However, commodities are tradingwell above historical real averages and marginal cost but global
        demandshould continue to improve even with our view of a softening Chinese propertymarket. Base metals look more
        attractive than the bulks. The mining cycle isstill in a recovery phase, and sector FCF and capital returns
        should continue toimprove despite rising operating costs and sustaining capex. We see 2018 asthe year M&amp;A;
        accelerates. The sector is trading on c.10% FCF yield, withgearing dropping to just 7% in 2018. Our top picks
        are RIO, BHP, SFR &amp; OGC.<br/><br/>
        Commodity outlook; trading above historical real averages but macro positive.<br/><br/>
        All but two commodities (aluminium and nickel) are trading above historicalreal averages (back to 1980), however
        with ongoing supply side discipline anda positive demand outlook (DBe global GDP growth forecast 3.8%), with
        amodest slowdown in China (mostly from credit tightening and lower propertysales), we think commodity prices
        could remain supported in 2018. Thereappears to be upside risk to demand from China, SE Asia and other
        emergingmarkets mostly on infrastructure and machinery. An ongoing weaker USD willalso be positive for
        commodities due to upward pressure on marginal costs.<br/><br/>
        Base metals S/D fundamentals continue to look more attractive than the bulkswhich we expect to weaken post
        Chinese heating season on increased supply.<br/><br/>
        We prefer aluminium, nickel, zinc and copper.<br/><br/>
        Sector themes; capital management, growth capex, M&amp;A;, cost inflation.<br/><br/>
        Management teams should remain disciplined in 2018. Capital returns shouldincrease further with ongoing buybacks
        from RIO, S32 (BHP should announcebuyback in Aug) possibly supplemented with special dividends, possibly
        fromAWC, S32 and WHC. With sector gearing at record low levels (sub-10%) wethink companies will increase growth
        capex, but it will remain below mid-cycleand we think the sector is short high quality projects. M&amp;A; should
        increasealso (likely gold, coal, lithium, mid and large cap base metals). The other thingsto watch are rising
        operating costs (labour, oil, stripping and contractor rates)and sustaining capex (holiday hangover).<br/><br/>
        Sector outlook and top picks; BUY; RIO, BHP, SFR, OGC; SELL; ILU, IGO.<br/><br/>
        The Australian mining sector is fairly valued on a P/NPV basis at 1xNPV on ourprice deck but remains attractive
        on an EV/EBITDA (6x) and FCF yield basis (c.<br/><br/>
        10% average for 2018) vs. historical averages. We remain positive on both RIOand BHP with improving shareholder
        and group returns (ROCE), productiongrowth and record FCF yields. In base and precious metals, we rate SFR,
        OGC,AQG and DCN a BUY and NCM, NST, RRL, IGO &amp; WSA a SELL. We upgradeOGC to BUY (0.85xNPV), and downgrade
        SBM to HOLD (1.1xNPV) and IGO toSELL on valuation (1.3xNPV).<br/><br/>
