    <p> Our view on major economies<br/><br/>
        The world economy has enjoyed a synchronized recovery in 2017. The growth of most major economies strengthened
        while inflation pressures remained muted and unemployment rate had a decline. With afocus on US, Eurozone, Japan
        and Chinawe expectthe following key trendsin 2018: 1) steady growth momentum should continue; 2) monetary
        policies would further converge, as the Fed, the ECB, the BoJ and the PBOC all scale back their monetary easing;
        3) We do not expect massive fiscal policy to take place other than in US which is set to the beneficiary of tax
        reform; 4). political risks, such as US mid-term elections in November 2018; several elections related events in
        major Eurozone countries; and notably Brexit, could still linger and adds some uncertainties. Weexpect US to
        outshine other major economies and China¡¯s growth with quality to bear fruits in medium term.</p>
