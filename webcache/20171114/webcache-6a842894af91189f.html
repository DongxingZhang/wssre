    <p> Since late-2016, the PBoC has been tightening liquidity in the interbank market. Themarket-traded 7-day repo
        rate increased to an average of 2.9% in September, from 2.5%in January. This happened against the backdrop of
        gradually tightening liquidity andslower base money growth over the past years. Despite slower capital inflows,
        the PBoChas refrained from cutting the reserve requirement ratio, and instead relied on short-termliquidity
        injections in the interbank market.。<br/><br/>
        These developments have increased the effectiveness of monetary policy. There isevidence, for example, that
        suggests a markedly higher sensitivity of liquidity instrumentsin the banking sector to short-dated interest
        rates. There have been side effects as well.。<br/><br/>
        The most notable one is the sharp divergence between the interest rates for banks andthat for the wider
        financial institutions. Reflecting the inherent liquidity hierarchy in thebanking system, this asymmetry is
        further exacerbated by the PBoC¨s shift toward agreater reliance on open market operations (OMOs), which
        transmit liquidity from thelarge banks to smaller non-bank financial institutions. This happens against the
        backdropof an already large gap between the cost of borrowing from and lending to the PBoC.。<br/><br/>
        To prevent the gap from rising further, a broadly stable liquidity backdrop is needed. In themedium term, the
        system-wide Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) should be reduced,with the liquidity impact offset through
        sterilisation, if needed. Regulatory reforms toreduce market segmentations are also necessary.。</p>
