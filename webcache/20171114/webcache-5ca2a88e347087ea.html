    <p> 2017guidance retained, aiming for Grasberg resolution by YE17<br/><br/>
        Freeport reported 3Q17sales broadly in line with expectations, maintained2017guidance and extended its Grasberg
        export permit from October to YE17.However, in our view, there was no concrete evidence of any progress
        towardsresolution (divestment process and valuation) at Grasberg in Indonesia.Freeport is working towards
        reaching an outcome by YE17(previouslyOctober). While we acknowledge this may occur, there is still uncertainty
        onthe outcome and we do not view the stock favorably on a risk/reward basis(trading at 1.13x NPV and 5x
        EV/EBITDA attributable 2018E at $3/lb copper)and maintain a Sell rating.<br/><br/>
        The good - Balance Sheet, 2017guidance maintained, copper exposure<br/><br/>
        1) Freeport has now reduced Net Debt (ND) to below $10bn, which comparesto $20.1bn at YE15. This will enable FCX
        to begin considering re-investment,highlighted with the $850m capex Lone Star project as a replacement
        forSafford with other opportunities at El Abra and Kisanfu (cobalt in the D.R.C).ND could fall towards $5bn by
        YE18at the current copper price, 2) Guidancefor 2017and forward years remains largely unchanged, a positive vs
        somerecent quarters when Grasberg disappointments resulted in reduced forecasts,3) We like copper in the
        medium-to-long term and see increasing deficits.</p>
