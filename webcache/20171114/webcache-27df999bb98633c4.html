    <p> The stock market consolidation continued and the Hang Seng Index fell slightly during the week, amid the closing
        of the 19th Communist Party Congress. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang will assume the top leadership
        for the second term, while five new faces are introduced into the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee. The
        local bourse was largely stable after the Congress, as market watchers expected President Xi would introduce
        pro-growth policies in the next five years, following his anti-corruption campaign in the first term. Over the
        week, the blue-chip index slipped 48.39 points or 0.17% to 28,438.85, while the HSCEI gained 0.7% to 11,643.57.
        The average daily Mainboard turnover fell to HK$88.6 billion, compared with HK$97.6 billion in the previous
        week.<br/><br/>
        Major Chinese stocks released their third-quarter results during the week. Corporate earnings largely improved
        in Q3, amid solid economic growth on the Mainland. Material plays recorded reviving earnings, as supply-side
        reform lent support, while bottom line of insurance companies rose y-o-y on better investment return. Meanwhile,
        investors turned their attention to the IPO of China Literature (#772), which opened its retail book on
        Thursday. The IPO is the first major spin-off from tech bellwether Tencent (#700) and is expected to draw
        enormous subscription interests from investors.<br/><br/>
        Corporate earnings release will stay busy on next Monday and Tuesday, before the Q3 reporting season comes to an
        end. After that, investors will turn their eyes to the two-day FOMC meeting scheduled next Tuesday and
        Wednesday. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold fire but may hint to raise interest rates as expected in the
        next FOMC meeting in December. Since investors continue to digest a possible rate hike in the US before the year
        end, buying spree is seen reviving soon to facilitate a market breakthrough in the near term.</p>
