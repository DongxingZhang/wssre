    <p> We maintain our mixed view on Goertek; retaining Hold rating<br/><br/>
        We like Goertek¡¯s strong top-line growth story, driven by organic growth fromVR headsets and smartphone acoustic
        upgrades, but we are equally concernedthat GPM could keep trending down (on a YoY basis), as low-margin
        VRheadsets and other ODM projects could outgrow the component business.Retaining Hold rating.<br/><br/>
        3Q17EPS missed on weak GPM<br/><br/>
        Goertek reported 3Q16EPS of RMB0.21(+12% YoY; 59% QoQ) and operatingprofit of RMB787mn (+13% YoY; +27% QoQ) on
        sales of RMB7.3bn (+20%YoY; +33% QoQ). Sales slightly beat DB estimate and Bloomberg consensusby 5%, due to a
        strong ramp in iPhone acoustics (iPhone 8/8Plus launch) andVR headsets (price cut in Oculus Rift and organic
        growth in Sony PS VR).However, operating profit and EPS missed DBe and consensus by 4%-8%, dueto forex loss of
        ~RMB90mn and a 2.9ppt QoQ decline in GPM (to 19.5% vs.DBe/consensus of 23%/22.7%). Goertek regards RMB
        appreciation and keyclient project delay (iPhone X) as the key culprits for GPM decline, but webelieve the price
        cut in VR headsets should be held responsible too.<br/><br/>
        4Q17and 2018outlook<br/><br/>
        Goertek expects 4Q17net profit of between RMB679m (+10% YoY) andRMB1,01bn (+64% YoY), driven by iPhone X ramp,
        acoustic ASP increase(spec upgrades) and organic demand growth for VR headsets. The guidance islargely in line
        with DBe and consensus. For 2018, Goertek highlights three keygrowth drivers: 1) in acoustics, spec upgrades
        (waterproofing, stereo sound,greater output power) will continue and Goertek feels confident of gainingmarket
        share in key projects, 2) in VR/AR headsets, the growth comes fromnew launches from old clients (Oculus and
        Sony), new clients (in the AR area)and rising in-house components for VR/AR headsets (such as lens, acousticsand
        MEMS microphones), and 3) rising demand for smart speakers (MEMSmicrophones for Amazon/Google/Apple) and
        wireless headphones (ODMprojects for Google Pixel Buds and Chinese OEMs).<br/><br/>
        Valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        We trim our 2017-19E EPS by 3%-7%, but lift our TP from RMB20.2to RMB22,as we roll over valuation from 22x
        2017-18average EPS to 22x 2018E EPS. 22xPER represents 0.8x PEG, in line with regional peers. Upside/downside
        risksinclude market share gain/loss and ASP increase/decline.</p>
