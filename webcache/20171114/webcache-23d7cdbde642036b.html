        summer promotion and fast capacityexpansion, non-GAAP operating margin fell by 4ppts YoY to 25%. Non-GAAPEPS of
        USD1.02was in line with DBe/consensus. K-12enrollment growthrecorded 22% YoY, with U-Can and POP Kids enrollment
        delivering 22% and23% YoY growth. For 2Q, management guided accelerating revenue growth of31-35% YoY (+29-33%
        excluding FX impact), mid-point of growth rate 8pptsahead of DBe. Full-year revenue guidance is ~30% YoY, 6%
        above consensus.Management maintains its long-term non-GAAP operating margin target of 17-18% unchanged. We like
        the robust expansion and raise our EPS by 1%-2% forFY19-20E after taking into account revenue increases and
        margin cuts.<br/><br/>

        Summer promotion attracted 554k enrollment in 38cities. The retention rate is~50%, leading to 270k+ additional
        enrollment in 2Q and ahead. We believe 2Qrevenue growth to deliver ~33% YoY growth. For FY18, management raised
        itscapacity expansion plan to 30% YoY (20% from new learning center openingand 10% from adding classroom areas
        to existing learning centers).<br/><br/>

        Maintaining Buy rating and raise target price to USD105<br/><br/>
        We revise up FY18-20E revenue by 6% each year and slightly increase non-GAAP net income forecasts by 1-2%. We
        maintain our Buy rating with a newtarget price of USD105. Our target price is based on 1.1x PEG against
        aCY18E-20E EPS CAGR of 32% and USD3.0non-GAAP EPS in CY18E.Downside risks: 1) slower enrolment growth; and 2)
        unfavorable regulatorypolicy.</p>
