    <p> A leading provider of smart operating system solutions. While mobile chips are headline-grabbing, mobile
        operating systems play an equally critical part in the mobile Internet industry chain. Thundersoft, a leading
        provider of smart operating system solutions, enjoys a clear advantage in terms of operating revenues and gross
        margins compared with its A-share competitors. Moreover, it counts global chip giants Qualcomm and Spreadtrum as
        its shareholders. The two currently contribute to more than 20% of Thundersoft¡¯s total operating
        revenue.<br/><br/>
        Sustainablegrowth on transformation.To preempt a revenue plateau, Thundersoft launched the Strategic 2.0
        initiative in 2012, featuring stand-alone software products and standardized modules and starting to charge
        customers based on volume instead of projects to unlock smart hardware growth potential and improve gross
        margins. Smart hardware was responsible for RMB128mn of Thundersoft¡¯s operating revenue in 2016, a massive YoY
        growth of 373.85%.<br/><br/>
        Acquiring into the in-vehicle system industry. Thundersoft bought out APPSYS and Huichi Technology in Apr. 2016
        for RMB102.6mn in cash-both are experts in pre-installed IVI systems, and pushed deeper into the in-vehicle
        system market by taking over Rightware, a world famous producer of in-vehicle digital instrument clusters.
        Thundersoft¡¯s in-vehicle system business brought in an operating revenue of RMB46.2031mn in 2016, up 68.88% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Profitability forecast. We estimate Thundersoft will notch up an operating revenue of RMB1.07bn/1.316bn for
        FY17/18, corresponding to a net profit of RMB138mn/175mn and EPS of RMB0.35/0.43. Recommend an Outperform
        rating. Risk factor. Smart hardware partners¡¯ shipments may fall short of expectations.</p>
