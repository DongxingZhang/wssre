    <p> The widely watched 19th Party Congress has ended, and the result is as largelyanticipated. As we discussed in
        our preview to the Party Congress, ¡°We don¡¯texpect much from the meeting itself, as it is mainly about personnel
        changes atthe top level, not a place to introduce new reform plans. For the financialmarket, what happens before
        and after the meeting is much moreimportant than what happens during the meeting.¡±Indeed, over the past two
        years the Chinese economy has been overshadowedby the Party Congress, as policy makers have put stability as the
        top priority.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, the next few months will be the window for top leaders to disclosetheir strategies for the next five
        years.<br/><br/>
        With political power being much more consolidated than five years ago, now thechallenge for top leaders is to
        justify that power by continuing to delivering ontheir key mandate: the Chinese Dream (ie, to make China great
        again). To dothat, they need to overcome two potential traps: the middle-income trap andthe Thucydides trap (ie,
        managing a peaceful rise as a great power).<br/><br/>
        Let¡¯s focus on the economy. In June 2016, we published a thematic report,¡°China¡¯s Debt: Myths and Realities.¡± In
        the first part of the report, we argued thatChina's debt risk is much lower than the prevalent views. However,
        in thesecond part we also discussed why China¡¯s economy could fall into a ¡°middleincometrap¡± due to the severe
        capital and land misallocations in the system.<br/><br/>
        In any case, a critical point post the Party Congress will be the CentralEconomic Work Conference, which will be
        held in December. Below aresome thoughts from us on the potential areas for reforms.</p>
