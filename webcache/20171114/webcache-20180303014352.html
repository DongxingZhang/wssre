        First take on Q3earnings: growth slows, banks beat, guidance is cautious. InitialQ3reporting in line with
        expectations: The start of the Q3season (15% ofcompanies have reported) has been broadly in line with
        expectations. AggregateEPS growth for the Stoxx 600at 7.8% yoy, down from 25% in Q1and 18% inQ2, but slightly
        ahead of consensus expectations, mainly because of financials.Across sectors, only 49% of companies have beaten
        expectations but 12% ofcompanies have reported results in line, keeping the number of earnings
        misseslow.<br/><br/>

        If you're sat next to Mr Draghi on your commute in Frankfurt over the nextcouple of days then maybe you can ask
        him what he has in store for us. As weapproached ECB day, global bond yields decided to take-off yesterday, with
        coreEuropean 10y bond yields up c4bp (Bunds +4.4bp; Gilts +4.3bp; OATs +4.1bp)and c1-2bp at the 2y part of the
        curve. In the US, 10year Treasuries tradedas high as 2.426% before closing 5.3bp higher at 2.42% - the highest
        sinceMarch. There didn't seem to be one reason for the bond moves but the newswe reported yesterday that the
        House are accelerating US tax plans seemedto help as did the Euro flash PMIs. As we'll see below the overall
        numberswere disappointing - dragged down by service sector misses, however the muchsmaller manufacturing sector
        beat and perhaps this was seen as slightly hawkishas it shows that the sector is not being unduly impacted by
        the recent rise in theEuro. As such it may give the ECB more comfort at the margin about being morehawkish and
        risking upward pressure on the Euro if it materialises as a result.</p>
