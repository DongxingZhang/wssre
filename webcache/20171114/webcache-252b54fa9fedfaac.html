    <p> 13% YoY earnings growth with flat margin despite SG&amp;A; expense expansion<br/><br/>
        3Q17gross revenue edged up by 12.1% YoY to RMB35.4bn. The revenue growthwas likely driven by production growth
        and new model launches from key OEMcustomers and good momentum on overseas business. Meanwhile, Huayu¡¯s3Q17gross
        profit grew 12.4% YoY to RMB4.7bn with a mild 6bps YoY gross profitmargin expansion. Together with 10.3% YoY
        growth in profit contribution from itsJVs/associates, but partially offset by 18.8% YoY jump in SG&amp;A;
        expenses, 3Q17net profit increased by 12.9% YoY to RMB1.6bn. On a 9M17basis, Huayu¡¯s netprofit of RMB4.8bn was
        up 7.8% YoY and accounted for 72% of our previousfull-year FY17earnings forecasts of RMB6.7bn (73% of Bloomberg
        consensus).Therefore, we consider the results in line with our expectation.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C favorable outlook intact with attractive valuation<br/><br/>
        We raise our FY17E revenue by 1.5% to reflect slightly better-than-expected 3Q17revenue growth. However, with
        lower margin assumptions, we adjust down ourFY17E earnings forecasts by 0.7%. For FY18-19E, we increase revenue
        forecast by9.0-9.3% and net profit by 0.6-2.1% to factor in the impact from recent acquisitionof the remaining
        50% stake in Shanghai Koito auto lamp JV.<br/><br/>
        Our TP is based on 12x FY18E P/E (from 10.5x, given the sector re-rating over thepast few months), in-line with
        Huayu¡¯s mid-cycle P/E of 12x. This is justified aswe expect Huayu to deliver a 12.8% FY16-19E three-year net
        profit CAGR. Theexpanding overseas sales of interior trim subsidiary Yanfeng and acquisition ofauto lamp
        business should provide an additional growth driver. Maintain Buy onattractive FY18E P/E of 11.3x and 4.8%
        dividend yield. Key downside risks: weakerauto sales and unexpected increase in raw material prices.</p>
