    <p> Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (ANO), the centrist, populist and big-tent politicalparty led by Andrej Babi?,
        won 78 seats in the Chamber of Deputies over theweekend, three times as many seats as the next contending party.
        Yet it failed toseize the absolute majority (101 seats) needed for a government to be capable ofadopting
        resolutions on its own.<br/><br/>
        A total of nine parties exceeded the 5% threshold to qualify for Parliament. Antiestablishmentparties scored
        higher than what polls had suggested, much atthe expense of current coalition partners and the rest of the left,
        especially thefar left (See Figure 1). Euro-sceptic ODS came in second, followed by two
        antiestablishmentparties, SPD and Pirates, both of which will hold seats in Parliamentfor the first time. Social
        Democrats, CSSD, were the clear loser with a drop ofover 13pp in support from the 2013 elections.<br/><br/>
        In our view, this gives Babi? the upper hand in negotiations with current coalitionmembers, with threats to form
        a centre-right (and now even an 'alternative')coalition credible (see more below). On the other hand, the
        implied chamberfragmentation may prove to be a double-edged sword, if each party refuses to giveup its demands
        in the hope of gains down the road. In the end, Babis' landslidevictory suggests ANO will dominate the cabinet
        agenda, pointing to a high degreeof continuity in key economic policies.<br/><br/>
        Negotiations in full swing since Sunday morning. Local media reported thatBabis met with KS?M leaders in the
        morning, then the former met representativesof STAN and CSSD. After an entire day of negotiations, the only
        thing thatemerged with some clarity late evening was that ANO wants to see some changesto the Chamber of
        Deputies, proposing Radek Vondr¨¢?ek as Chairman of theChamber. On Monday, Babis will meet with President Milos
        Zeman, who hasopenly expressed his intention of nominating Babis as Prime Minister.</p>
