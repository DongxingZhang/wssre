    <p> 19th CCP Party Congress, revised GDP growth and 3Q earnings quick take<br/><br/>
        At the 19th CCP Party Congress, President Xi gave a speech outlining a planfor China in the long term, without
        mentioning the 2020growth target as hispredecessor did in the past. 3Q GDP came in at 6.8% yoy in real terms, in
        linewith expectations. Our Chief China Economist Zhiwei Zhang now expects 6.6%growth in 4Q and 6.8% for the full
        year. 3Q earnings season has just gottenunderway; 300+ A-shares have announced results, for which earnings
        grew59% yoy in 3Q, vs. 45% yoy in 2Q on a comparable basis, with cyclical(steel/chemical/paper) being the most
        robust sectors. We include some of ouranalysts¡¯ 3Q results commentary on page 4and also key earnings
        upgradesestimate over the past month on page 7.<br/><br/>
        Performance and valuations: HSCEI/MXCI/CSI300gained 3.8%/2.5%/2.6%<br/><br/>
        In the past four weeks, HSCEI gained 3.8%, outperforming MSCI China(+2.5%), A-shares (+2.6%) and EM (+1.3%).
        Environmental, insurance, banksand select defensives led, while real estate, transportation and telecom
        postedlosses. The MSCI China (ex. ADRs) 12m forward P/E stands on par withhistorical average at 11.5x while P/B
        is at 1.5x, or a 12% discount to thehistorical average. A-share CSI300rose 2.6% in RMB terms in the past
        fourweeks, led by defensives, insurance and large-caps. The index trades at 13.6xand 1.7x 12m forward earnings
        and book value, respectively. Despite strongYTD performance, we believe MSCI China remains very attractive in
        terms ofdiscount to its historical average as compared to other global indices.<br/><br/>
        Macro and earnings: 3Q macro in line; material/property led earnings upgrade<br/><br/>
        Macro data was largely in line for 3Q/Sept: 1) PMI stayed strong as NBS PMIrose to a multi-year high. IP
        slightly beat at 6.6% yoy and is notably above lastmonth¡¯s 6.0%; 2) New loans and TSF beat expectations again.
        Adjusted TSFbalance growth was stable at 14.8% yoy while corp. M/LT loan balance wasgrowing at an elevated 17.4%
        yoy; 3) Investment diverged as FAI growthslowed across the board, but property investment improved by 0.2ppt to
        8.1%YTD yoy. MSCI China 2018E consensus EPS remain largely unchanged in thepast four weeks, though materials and
        real estate saw notable upgrades.Liquidity and sentiment: H-shr and A-shr liquidity and sentiment largely
        stableHK equities¡¯ ADT averaged HKD93bn in Oct¡¯ MTD, a touch lower than lastmonth but still strong compared with
        the YTD average. Connect inflowscontinued both ways while volatilities subsided. A-share sentiment was
        stable.Onshore rates and credit spreads both moderated.<br/><br/>
        End-FY17index targets, sector preference and weightings<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our end-17MSCI China/HSCEI targets at 83/11,900. Werecommend overweight internet, financials,
        consumer services (education),metals and mining (steel, non-ferrous) and water/IPPs, and we wouldunderweight
        telecom, coal, airlines, traditional retailing and staples. We expect2017/18growth of 18.5%/15.1% for MSCI
        China. Our recommended subsectorpreference and weightings for MSCI China are shown in Figure 2.<br/><br/>
        Risks<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks: 1) tighter-than-expected monetary policy; 2) harsher-thanexpectedproperty tightening; 3) any
        disorderly deleveraging as China tightensshadow credit; and 4) sharper-than-expected RMB depreciation.</p>
