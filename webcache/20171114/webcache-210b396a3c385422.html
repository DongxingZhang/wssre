    <p> FY17profit guidance maintained<br/><br/>
        CBPO reported sales/non-GAAP profit of USD100m/39m, representing YoYgrowth of 15%/15% in USD and 15%/15% in RMB,
        respectively. The revenuegrowth was mainly driven by placenta polypeptide, while albumin and IVIGachieved decent
        volume growth. Management lowered FY17revenue guidancein RMB terms to 9-10%, while maintaining non-GAAP profit
        guidance of 18-20%.This implies sales/non-GAAP profit growth of 8%/18% for 4Q17, taking midpointsof the
        guidance. For 4Q17, management expects continued increase in sellingexpenses, as well as ASP erosion at similar
        magnitude as in 3Q17.<br/><br/>
        Volume growth of key products<br/><br/>
        In RMB terms, human albumin sales were up 2.4% in 3Q17, driven by5.8% increase in volume due to enhanced
        production volumes in Guizhou, aswell as 3.2% price erosion given mix change and competition. According
        tomanagement, the overall supply of albumin was down 6.5% in 3Q17, whiledomestic/import supply was down 10%/3%,
        and the company's supply was up8% YoY. IVIG sales grew 7.4% driven by 7.9% volume growth, while ex-FX ASPsaw a
        decline of 0.4% from the offering of price discounts in key markets. Theoverall volume of IVIG decreased by 24%
        in 3Q17, while the company's supplywas down 17% YoY. Other IG sales were up 10% in 3Q17vs. 29% in 1H17, givena
        high base in 3Q16. Placenta polypeptide sales jumped 85%, though this isprimarily driven by ASP increase amid
        swift implementation of two-invoice. Onmarket share, the company occupies 15% and 16% of albumin and IG
        marketshare, respectively, among domestic players in China.<br/><br/>
        Margin erosion due to higher selling expenses<br/><br/>
        GM in 3Q17was slightly down at 67.4%, vs. 68.0% in 3Q16, while OPM erodedsignificantly to 38.2% from 45.9% in
        3Q16. Management attributed the marginerosion to adjustment of ex-manufacturing price, as well as increase of
        sales andmarketing expenses of other hyper immune products. We highlight that tax ratelowered to 14% vs. 17% in
        3Q16, while minority interest remained relatively low.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining price target of USD130; risks<br/><br/>
        Our price target of USD130is based on 23.5x 2018E forward EPS. We believethe multiple is justified, as the
        company¡¯s global peers are trading at 27x, with14% EPS growth in 2019E vs. 12% for CBPO in RMB. Key risks
        include M&amp;Aintegration;, price erosion, disruption in plasma collection, cost inflation and delaysin product
        launches.</p>
