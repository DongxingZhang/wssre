    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +6.4%. Weekly loadings up 2.1%<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 6.4% in Week#44(ended 10/28/2017) vs. a 6.1%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 0.8%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 2.1% YoY (versus a 6.9%
        increase in the priorweek) and decreased 2.6% sequentially (vs. a 0.5% decrease in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices roughly flat at 27c/gal. Propane down 3c/lb to 95c/gal<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices fell a modest 0.2c/gal last week to 26.8c/gal (vs its fuel value of19c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has
        declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston.
        Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/dfundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from
        thestart-up of 8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade toward
        its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue, with the premium reflecting fractionation, transportation
        and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate ethane prices will
        likely move toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices fell 2.9c/lb last week to 95.1c/gal. While propane inventorieswere up 1% last week to 78MM bbls,
        they are 17% and 8% below their 3and5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventories to
        declinedue to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).Spot ethylene down 0.7c/lb to 27.5c/lb.
        Margins down 1.1c/lb to 10.4c/lbSpot ethylene prices fell 0.7c/lb last week to 27.5c/lb (vs the October
        contractprice of 34.75c/lb). Spot deals for October ranged from 27.25to 27.75c/lbwith deals for November ranged
        between 25.75-27.5c/lb. Average spotethylene margins compressed 1.1c/lb last week to 10.4c/lb on lower
        sellingprices and higher production costs (higher naptha and gas oil).<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were lower last week with deals forOctober delivery at 44-44.5c/lb.
        October propylene contract prices settled up1.5c/lb at 48.0c/lb for PG and 46.5c/lb for chemical grade. This
        follows a 7c/lb increase in September. The 8.5c/lb, or 21%, increase in propylene pricesin September and October
        has been driven by supply tightness due toHurrricane Harvey which caused outages at multiple US Gulf Coast
        olefins andrefinieres as well as delaying a new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unitwhich had been scheduled to
        start up in September.<br/><br/>
        5.3% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in November<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, CPChem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) and Sweeny, TX cracker
        (0.6% of NA ethylene capacity)remain offline as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#1) cracker(1.6%
        of NA ethylene capacity) and Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NAethylene capacity) will be offline in November
        for planned turnaround work. For¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 5.2B lbs, or 6.3%,
        ofcapacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or4.1%, of ethylene capacity in
        ¡¯15.</p>
