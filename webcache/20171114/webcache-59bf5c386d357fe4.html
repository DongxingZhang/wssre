    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +4.7%. Weekly loadings up 6.2%<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 4.7% in Week#42(ended 10/14/2017) vs. a 2.9%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 0.6%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 6.2% YoY (versus a 10.4%
        increase in the priorweek) and decreased 0.7% sequentially (vs. a 1.5% decrease in the prior week).Ethane prices
        down 0.7c/gal to 25.8c/gal. Propane down 3.4c/lb to 90.4c/galEthane prices declined 0.7c/gal last week to
        25.8c/gal (vs its fuel value of 19c/gal). While US ethane supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane
        rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise
        Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston. Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/dfundamentals to
        tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from thestart-up of 8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19.
        As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue,
        with the premium reflecting fractionation, transportation and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas
        price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate ethane prices will move toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices declined 3.4c/lb last week to 90.4c/gal. While propane<br/><br/>
        inventories were flat last week at 79MM bbls, they are 16% and 9% belowtheir 3and 5-yr avgs, respectively.
        Longer term, we expect propane inventoriesto decline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in
        ¡¯17E).Spot ethylene up 1.3c/lb to 29.8c/lb. Margins up 1.3c/lb to 13.2c/lbSpot ethylene prices rose 1.3c/lb last
        week to 29.8c/lb (vs the Septembercontract price of 35.25c/lb, and August contract prices of 31.25c/lb).
        Spotdeals for October ranged from 28.5to 31.0c/lb with deals for Novemberranged between 26.5-30.0c/lb. Average
        spot ethylene margins expanded 1.3c/lb last week to 13.2c/lb on higher selling prices.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were lower last week with deals for<br/><br/>
        October delivery ranged between 44.75-45.75c/lb. September propylenecontract prices settled up 7c/lb at 46.5c/lb
        for PG and 45.0c/lb for chemicalgrade on the back of Hurricane Harvery supply disruptions. Propylene
        prices,which had risen 21c/lb, or 68% (for PG), from December to March, fell 14c/lb,or 27%, in April/May due to
        improving refinery-based supply. Prices rose 0.5c/lb in July and August.<br/><br/>
        ~14% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in October<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, CP Chem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) and Sweeny, TX cracker
        (0.6% of NA ethylene capacity), andEquistar¡¯s La Porte, TX cracker (3.1% of NA ethylene capacity) remain offline
        asa result of Hurricane Harvey. Nova Chemical¡¯s Sarnia, Ont cracker (2% of NAethylene capacity), Dow¡¯s Taft, LA
        (#1) cracker (1.6% of NA ethylene capacity),Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1% of NA ethylene capacity) and Shell¡¯s
        Deer Park,TX cracker (3% of NA ethlylene capacity) will be offline in October for plannedturnaround work. For
        ¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 5.2Blbs, or 6.3%, of capacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs, or
        5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.</p>
