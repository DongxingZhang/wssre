    <p> Around 70% yoy volume growth for mainstream Moutai (DB estimates).To recap, Moutai indicated on August 28that it
        supplied 6,200tons ofliquor (including 5,600tons of "Feitian Moutai" and 600tons of otherSKUs) between August
        15and September 30, to meet the strong demandduring National Holiday and Mid-Autumn Festival, implying 70%
        yoygrowth.<br/><br/>
        Strong growth of super premium Moutai. We estimated that most of 600tons of other SKU are super premium Moutai.
        This drives mix-upgrade formainstream Moutai.<br/><br/>
        Strong growth of mass market Moutai products. According to news fromMoutai website, mass market Moutai sales
        increased over 200% yoyin the first 9months. This is a result of Moutai's "133" brand strategy(one core brand,
        three strategy brands - Huamao, Wangmao, Laimao,and three key brands - Hanjiang, Renjiu and Wangzi). Meanwhile,
        thenumber of domestic distributors increased by 634YTD to 2,965, mainlyfor penetration of mass market
        Moutai.<br/><br/>
        Net margin expanded 440bps yoy on operating leverage<br/><br/>
        Moutai's gross margin was stable at 75% in 3Q17, as the impact from lowermargin mass-market products was offset
        by high margin customized Moutai.Selling expense ratio increased 20bps yoy to 3.2%, due to increasing A&amp;P;
        expensefor its "133" brand strategy and "5+5" channel strategy (5core markets and 5potential markets). G&amp;A;
        expense ratio declined 480bps yoy , mainly helped byoperating leverage.<br/><br/>
        Increasing transparency in revenue recognition<br/><br/>
        Moutai booked most ex-factory shipments as revenue in 3Q17. This is differentfrom market's and our expectation
        that it would allocate the shipments into salesand advances from customer accounts. Therefore, advances from
        customers were stable at Rmb17bn on Sep 30(vs Rmb18bn on June 30). This partlycontributed to the results beat in
        3Q. We believe this implies increasingtransparency and improving cooperate governance for the company.</p>
