        Global nickel market is expected to continue third consecutive year of deficit in2018, per International Nickel
        Study Group (INSG). Demand from stainlesssteel industry is expected to increase, along with production of
        nickelcontainingbatteries. Global demand expected at 2.26mt in 2018 (vs. supply of2.21mt), implying a 53kt
        deficit. For 2017, INSG expects demand at 2.15mt (vs.<br/><br/>
        supply of 2.05mt), with a 98kt deficit. INSG expects demand from stainlesssteel to moderate in 2H17, but demand
        from Electric Vehicle batteries to havea positive effect in 2018. (Mining Weekly)Philippines Environment
        Minister hopes to eradicate ban on open-pit mining byYE17 after a government panel recommended its removal.
        Although open-pitmining is allowed under the mining laws in Philippines, former EnvironmentMinster Regina Lopez

        raised to 4% for large iron ore miners (previous proposal was 2-4%dependent on prices), whereas small miners
