        It¡¯s still hard to get excited by the tax plan ¨C even if it goes through. The impactof stimulus on longer term

        Bank of England - Britain finally joined the global rate hike party yesterday with aquarter per cent rise.
        Indeed, since the financial crisis, there have been 155ratehikes by G20central banks. Only Japan has now avoided
        one. Given GovernorCarney¡¯s many ¡°dovish tightening¡± caveats, most assume a glacial pace of furtherhikes. But
        consider the reluctance of UK business to invest. Before the crisis,capital investment contributed one
        percentage point to productivity; now it hashalved. In effect, business has become more reliant on labour which
        is partly whyproductivity growth has averaged a painfully low 0.4per cent since the crisis,half that of the US.
        Yet, Britain¡¯s unemployment rate of 4.3per cent is below thenatural rate. So if Brexit exacerbates the workforce
        supply constraint, inflationarywage pressures may force the Bank of England¡¯s hand earlier than expected.</p>
