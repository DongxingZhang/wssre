    <p> PC2better than expected, but gold production down 5% QoQ<br/><br/>
        NCM has produced 523koz in the Sept Q, 6% below our estimate due tounderperformance at Lihir and Telfer. Cadia
        output of 121koz was 9% ahead ofour forecast on a better than expected recovery at PC2. Group C2costs were5%
        ahead of our estimate, with AISC of US$898/oz 5% below on a US$434/oznon-cash adjustment at Cadia. The company
        should release a strategic reviewon Bonikro by Dec-17and an updated Feasibility Study on Wafi-Golpu by Mar-18.
        We have revised FY18earnings to US$438m (+10%) on a more optimisticPC2ramp-up profile. NCM is trading on
        9xEBITDA, 5% FCF yield compared toASX peers at 4-5x, and 1.2x NPV (A$18.89/sh, +3%); SELL retained.<br/><br/>
        Lihir and Telfer come down off a strong June Q<br/><br/>
        The QoQ pullback at Lihir was sharper than expected. Production of 203kozwas 11% below our estimate. Scheduled
        plant maintenance was compoundedby an outage at one of the oxygen plants, and a bench slip that restrictedaccess
        to higher grade ore. The mill ran at 13.6Mtpa in the quarter, howevershould recover to 14Mtpa into next quarter
        and beyond. AISC of US$1,072/ozwas 21% ahead of our estimates. Similarly, Telfer production of 94koz was17%
        below our estimate due to unplanned mill outages and lower thanexpected grade. AISC of US$1,483/oz was 33% above
        of our estimates on thelower gold sales and copper credits. The final cutback of West Dome Stage 2was approved
        at an expected capital cost of A$93m ¨C we already included thisin our estimates, in addition to the final Stage
        3cutback.<br/><br/>
        Cadia on track to get back to nameplate by end of year<br/><br/>
        After the seismic event in April, NCM has re-established extraction from bothPC1and PC2. PC2was able to achieve
        14Mtpa in the Q (nameplate 18Mtpa), aquarterly record. Work continues to define the cave shape,
        howeverestablishing monitoring bores has proved challenging as holes have collapsed.While this is problematic,
        it does seem to indicate that material above the caveis well fractured. NCM continues to monitor seismic
        activity, and haveimplemented a draw strategy that gives them comfort on lifting draw rates.We assume PC2reaches
        an 18Mtpa run-rate by the end of CY17. PC1restarted at the end of the Q. Previously, PC1has reached extraction
        rates ashigh as 16Mtpa. We expect it will reach 9Mtpa by the end of CY17, beforeramping up further into FY19as
        the Cadia mill is pushed to 30Mtpa.<br/><br/>
        A$19.0/sh PT (prev. A$18.4/sh); SELL retained on valuation<br/><br/>
        Our PT is set broadly in line with our DCF-derived valuation (7.2% WACC) ofA$18.89/sh (3% higher on a more
        optimistic PC2ramp-up profile). Upsiderisks; operational outperformance, FX &amp; gold/copper prices.</p>
