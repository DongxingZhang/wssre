        China¨s President Xi plans to continue battle on smog for a long time. Chinahas recently ordered factories to

        renewablepower and curbing use of coal. Separately, Tangshan, the largest steelmakingcity in Hebei province, is
        reportedly close to issuing detailed output cut plans.Ranked by environmental performance, the worst mills will
        be required to cutoutput by 75% whereas the best by 20-25%. (Reuters, SBB)。<br/><br/>
        Western Australian (WA) government commits to reducing red tape andregulatory duplications to promote nickel
