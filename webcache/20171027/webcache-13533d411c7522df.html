    <p> In September, the Brent price rose 8% to US$56.53/bbl and the Brent forwardcurve moved into the steepest
        backwardation since 2014on signs of marketrebalancing. This shift is primarily due to the following factors: 1)
        A strong supplyresponse by OPEC and its allies to Saudi/Russia-led calls for production cuts.OPEC¡¯s September
        output decreased 0.4mb/d yoy to 32.7mb/d, with OPEC andRussia considering an extension of the output cut through
        2018. 2) Significantchanges in the US oil production outlook. DB expects US tight oil to grow ata more modest
        0.7mb/d in 2018(trimmed by 0.4kb/d) and 0.3mb/d in 2019onlowered estimates for current rig productivity. 3) The
        IEA and EIA forecast abroadly balanced oil market in 2018, while OPEC projects modest undersupplydue to lower
        non-OPEC production. In spite of these bullish forces, the IEAforecasts an inventory build in 1Q18, keeping a
        lid on the price rise. We haverevised our estimates for our oil coverage names (PTR, SNP, CNOOC and COSL)based
        on DB's commodities quarterly price revisions. We believe that among ouroil names, CNOOC (TP raised to HKD13.50,
        Buy) offers the best direct leverage tothis price upside and COSL (TP raised to HKD8.64, Buy) would benefit from
        theoil price triggering increased spending on E&amp;P; activities. We have also raised ourTPs for Sinopec
        (HKD7.71, Buy) and PetroChina (HKD5.55, Hold).</p>
