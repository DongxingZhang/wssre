    <p> Following a strong bullish run in biotech (both large- and smid-cap have<br/><br/>
        rallied) that was largely triggered by the Kite acquisition by Gilead, the key<br/><br/>
        questions remains as to whether the recent momentum will continue. We look<br/><br/>
        ahead to upcoming 3Q17 results to help influence this outlook, with much of<br/><br/>
        the recent move largely driven by sentiment changes (multiple expansion), vs.<br/><br/>
        greatly improved near-term revenue or earnings growth. As such, we believe<br/><br/>
        management commentary around potential strategic directions and longer-term<br/><br/>
        expectations will be especially important. While we are not quite ready to call new<br/><br/>
        (sustained) bull run for the sector (which until recently had largely lagged the rest<br/><br/>
        of the market), we believe 3Q17 results will help frame the likelihood of continued<br/><br/>
        outperformance. With clinical data and regulatory/commercial catalysts the<br/><br/>
        lifeblood of the sector, the rest of the year is expected to be quite busy, as we focus<br/><br/>
        on several key read-outs in our coverage universe including ABBV/NBIX readout<br/><br/>
        in uterine fibroids, PEPITES topline data for DBVT, among others. Overall, we<br/><br/>
        continue to view a favorable risk/reward skew for the majority of our covered<br/><br/>
        companies, and see ALXN and GILD as our favorite large-cap names heading<br/><br/>
        into year-end, while NBIX, BMRN, ESPR, and PRTA are favored on the mid-cap<br/><br/>
        side over the next 12mos.¡£<br/><br/>
        Amgen (AMGN - HOLD - $177) - While Rx and sales data suggest potential<br/><br/>
        upside to the quarter, and recent positive newsflow regarding potential Neulasta<br/><br/>
        biosimilars should also move near-term numbers higher, AMGN shares have<br/><br/>
        outperformed along with the rest of the group, and we continue to remain<br/><br/>
        cautious on the near-to-mid-term outlook given slowing growth and potential<br/><br/>
        headwinds to key pipeline products (Repatha, Kyprolis, etc). We look to additional<br/><br/>
        company comments regarding the trajectory of these key franchises, as well as<br/><br/>
        the longer-term outlook on Enbrel, which remains central to the valuation.¡£¡¢</p>
