    <p> Maintain Sell on Lenovo 2022s.<br/><br/>
        Our regular readers will know that our negative view on Lenovo 2022s hasbeen driven by concerns around
        underlying businesses and rich valuations.<br/><br/>
        The former hasn't abated yet. Although the HKD3.9 billion equity raising in Octcomes as a positive surprise, it
        is unlikely to see immediate deleveraging giventhe announced acquisition of 51% stake in Fujitsu¡¯s PC business
        and itsplanned investment of USD1.2 billion in AI over 4-5 years. In addition, the putoption for Compal to
        offload its 49% interests in the JV (up to USD750 million)to Lenovo is exercisable after Oct 1, 2017. From a
        valuation perspective, weacknowledge bonds don't look as stretched now. The 2022s (G+185bp bid)have
        underperformed, widening ~5bp since issuance in mid-March, against~30bps tightening for China Corp during the
        same period. However, comparedto other unrated bonds from China like Chalco 2022s (G+175bp) and ChinaChengtong
        2022s (G+170bp), the Lenovo bonds still don't look cheap. Evenlooking at higher BB rated HK names like Lifestyle
        2022s (G+205bp), Lenovoappears expensive. The perps ($102.75 ask, G+275bp) on the other hand wasrelatively fair
        and we stay Hold on them. We do note though that these perpshave a weak structure with just a "performance
        guarantee" from Lenovo.<br/><br/>
        Acquisition of 51% stake in Fujitsu¡¯s PC business.<br/><br/>
        Lenovo unveiled its plans to acquire 51% stake in Fujitsu Client Computing Ltd(FCCL) while Fujitsu would retain
        the remaining 49%. Total consideration is~HKD1.23 billion, plus performance-based payment of HKD175 million to
        HKD875 million payable shortly after March 2020. Fundamentally, FCCL generatedpositive operating profit (HKD633
        million for the year ended March 2017) andits asset size is relatively small at HKD10.3 billion at Mar¡¯17.
        Operationally, thedeal will help Lenovo to increase its market share in Japan to ~40% from~30% per Bloomberg.
        While certainly not negative, we don¡¯t foresee anyfundamental positive change in Lenovo¡¯s underlying businesses
        (PC'sstructural challenges and Mobile's losses) due to this deal alone.<br/><br/>
        2Q results.<br/><br/>
        - EBITDA reached USD240 million (+10% yoy/+52% qoq) on revenues ofUSD11.8 billion (+5% yoy/+17% qoq). The margin
        improvement is mainlysupported by sacrificing growth for profitability in the PC segment (~70% ofrevenues) with
        1.5% yoy decline of PC shipment, and ~25bp expansion in pretaxprofit margin. New smartphone launches brought a
        19% qoq revenueincrease in the Mobile segment, but also leaded to higher advertising andpromotion expenses and
        thus softer pre-tax numbers in this segment (-USD132 million in Q2 vs -USD129 million in Q1). Data Center
        Business (~8% ofrevenues) continued to be the weakest segment by profitability, with pre-taxprofit margin at
        -10%.<br/><br/>
        - Adjusted OCF was positive at USD346 million, versus negative USD568million in 1Q17 and positive USD1.6 billion
        in 2Q16. Capex stood at USD173million during the quarter, excluding stake sale of USD82 million and
        assetsdisposal gain of USD5 million. Overall FCF was slightly negative at USD32million after dividend payment of
        USD292 million.<br/><br/>
        - On the balance sheet front, total debts and cash balance came down toUSD3.7 billion and USD1.3 billion,
        respectively, from USD3.9 billion andUSD1.5 billion at Jun¡¯17. LTM gross leverage decreased slightly from 4.4x
        to4.1x while LTM net leverage was a tad higher from 2.6x to 2.7x.<br/><br/>
