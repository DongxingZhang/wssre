    <p> Conclusion: A bounce in GDP growth in QE Sep to 6.3% depicts that a gradualhealing of the economy is underway
        post the disruption caused bydemonetization and implementation of GST. We expect the activity momentumto sustain
        in 2HFY18 and GDP growth to improve to ~7.2%YoY from 6.0% in1HFY18, keeping the full year FY18 growth at 6.7%.
        While there could bedownside risks to the growth estimate from possibly lower government spendingand uncertainty
        around capex growth in 2HFY18, if the exit growth rate for QEMar-18 is around 7%, it will be a reasonable
        outcome in our view. We expectRBI to keep policy rates unchanged in the review next week, given the
        inflationtrajectory is expected to move higher and today¡¯s data shows some recovery ingrowth is
        underway.<br/><br/>
        Quarterly real GDP (at market prices) grew by 6.3% YoY in QE Sep-17 vs.<br/><br/>
        consensus and our expectations of 6.4%YoY: This compares with 5.7%YoYgrowth registered in QE Jun-17. Similarly,
        growth measured on a GVA (grossvalue added) basis stood at 6.1% YoY in QE Sep-17 (consensus expectation of6.2%
        YoY) vs. 5.6% YoY in the QE Jun-17.<br/><br/>
        High frequency growth had suggested a turn in activity post GST relateddisruption: The high frequency data that
        we track such as auto sales, industrialproduction, core sector output, corporate profits, etc. had shown an
        improvementin QE Sep. Indeed, gross value added excluding agriculture and governmentservices grew by 6.8% in QE
        Sep vs. 5.5% in QE Jun, reflecting normalisation inactivity post GST related disruption.<br/><br/>
        Expect growth normalisation in FY19: We expect GDP growth to normalise toapprox. 7.2%bYoY in FY19, based on
        continued support from consumption,recovery in exports and public infra capex spending.<br/><br/>
        #1 Consumption to be supported by revival in rural consumption: In ourview, going forward, rural consumption
        will recover from here, as indicated by animprovement in real rural wages, a slight uptick in MSP prices and
        improvementin terms of trade for the farmers. We expect urban consumption to grow at asteady state level as the
        support from wage hike-related fiscal spending andtrailing benefits of lower inflation / borrowing costs taper
        off.<br/><br/>
        #2 Export recovery: The expectation of continued healthy global growth into2018 is a positive for India¡¯s growth
        recovery, as exports account for ~20% ofGDP and positively impact trends in industrial production and capex
        cycle.<br/><br/>
        #3 Acceleration in infrastructure spending can fill the lacuna due to weakor delayed private investment
        spending: We expect tepid recovery in privatecapex in FY18 and hence government efforts to boost capex are
        critical tosupport its recovery. The government¡¯s recently unveiled infrastructure spendingprogram (US$105bn
        over the next five years) is a positive for public capex.<br/><br/>
        Risks to the growth outlook: The risks to the growth outlook stem from: (1)weaker than expected global growth,
        which can dampen India¡¯s recovery; (2)increases in global commodity prices, exposing India to macro stability
        risks ofhigher inflation and wider current account deficit; (3) capital market risk aversiondue to spillover
        from the normalization of monetary policy in advancedeconomies; and (4) changes in the government¡¯s policy
        stance such that itmeddles negatively with the productivity dynamic.</p>
