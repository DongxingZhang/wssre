        Financial sector leverage narrowed significantly, reflecting the ongoingdeleveraging process. We find the
        inverted credit-M2 gap to be a good leadingindicator for bond yield, with a lag of about 3 months. What's the
        link betweenfinancial sector leverage and bond yield? When the financial sector leveragedup, smaller banks
        aggressively expanded their balance sheet through wholesalefunding, and increased holdings of longer term safe
        assets. The shadow bankingsector also increased exposure to bonds, mainly through asset managementfunds. In the
        deleveraging process, small banks and asset management fundsbecome less expansionary. The newly released
        regulation on asset managementproducts may have led to another round of reduced bond purchases by
        assetmanagement funds, which in turn pushed qdup bond yields.<br/><br/>
        Interest rates may also partly reflect rising inflation expectations. Nonfood CPIinflation has been rising
        steadily. CPI inflation could rise further if food pricesbottom out. As our baseline forecast we see CPI
        inflation could reach 3% in early2018 around the Chinese New Year, then edge down in the rest of the year.
        Ifinflation stays elevated in Q2, investors and policy makers will likely become moreconcerned.</p>
