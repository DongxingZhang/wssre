    <p> In the council¡¯s opinion, the external inflationary environment remains moderate,as in previous assessments. It
        retained an optimistic view that investment maypick up in the short run, led by a rise in construction and
        manufacturing outputgrowth. Although as in previous press conferences, the individual members'optimistic but
        still cautious view on investment surfaced again. A slight, butnotable change in the statement was in regards to
        the acknowledgementthat "core inflation has risen", but remains "moderate" (vs "is still low", thataccompanied
        the statements since April this year). Overall, in the council¡¯sopinion, the annual growth in prices of consumer
        goods and services remains ata moderate level.<br/><br/>
        As we expected, the inflation profile for 2017 was lifted minimally, giving theyearly rate of inflation a 50%
        probability in the interval between 1.9% and2.0%, versus the 1.6% to 2.3% range seen in the July 2017
        projection. Thebank's November projection based on the NECMOD model forecasting now seesinflation to average
        1.6% to 2.9% in 2018 with a 50% probability (compared to1.1%-2.9% in the previous round). At the same time, with
        a 50% probability band,the annual GDP growth is expected in the range of 3.8%-4.6% in 2017 (against3.4-4.7% in
        the July 2017 projection), and 2.8-4.5% in 2018 (against to 2.5-4.5%,in the July projection).</p>
