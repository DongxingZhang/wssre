    <p> The designation of General Manuel Quevedo as the new president of PDVSA andminister of hydrocarbons could add
        downside to the already poor performanceexhibited by the PDVSA/Venezuela bond complex since President Nicolas
        Maduroannounced plans to restructure external debt earlier this month. There are risksthat the company¡¯s
        operations would prioritize political goals over the need tostabilize production and the new management could
        weaken its commitmentto debt service. Moreover, Quevedo would be an easier target for US sanctionsthan his
        technocratic predecessors Nelson Martinez and Eulogio Del Pino. TheGeneral faces human rights accusations for
        the handling of opposition protestswhile serving as a National Guard commander in Caracas. Finally,
        leadershipinstability and policy uncertainty continues to deter investment and could deepenthe current decline
        in oil production. We are surprised by the relatively mutedreaction of bond prices to the reshuffling news. The
        market still seems supportedby Friday¡¯s announcement that PDVSA will pay $233m in past due coupons onits 2020
        and 2022 bonds. However, another $1bn in interest payments will beoverdue by the end of the year and the
        prospects of the new dialogue betweenthe government and the opposition do not seem very auspicious.</p>
