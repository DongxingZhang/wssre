    <p> Share-price correction worrisome: The tech sector is facing growing concerns oversliding memory chip prices and
        chances of an industry peak. Shares in semiconductormaterials suppliers and equipment makers, including our top
        pick SK Materials, havecorrected substantially, the magnitude surely a matter of concern. Yet, we maintain
        ourinvestment ratings after answering the following questions.<br/><br/>
        Will semiconductor materials/equipment stocks keep rallying when shares inSamsung Electronics and SK Hynix trend
        down?A limited correction in semiconductor materials/equipment stocks seemed unavoidable.<br/><br/>
        After it ends, however, investors realize industry risks and eye small caps upstream thatshould benefit from
        hikes in both chipmaker investments and raw-material costs, withboth increases providing the foundation of our
        investment ideas. Robust top-line growthupstream should increasingly draw attention while chipmakers valuations
        are stuckbetween expectations of stable earnings and concerns over an industry peak.<br/><br/>
        How long will the correction persist?The correction may not end anytime soon as the semiconductor supply chain
        had ralliedsharply over the past month and global tech shares are also correcting. Yet, we see a lowchance of
        long-term weakness as the construction of fabs by the clients suggests supplywill fall short of demand for the
        time being. The current slide in shares is likely to ease ifmemory prices hold up well and companies post
        better-than-expected results.<br/><br/>
        Do memory capacity expansions benefit semiconductor material andequipment stocks?They certainly do. Fab
        construction lifts earnings visibility for the following two or threeyears, so that event itself should initiate
        a rerating. Our real concern, however, layelsewhere. If sentiment sours too much, investors may simply view
        memory capacityadditions as a sign of oversupply and shun investing in the supply chain. We need todistinguish
        whether the capex decision is meant to overcome supply shortages or gain theupper hand in competition. The
        former is positive and the latter is negative, of course, andwe think capacity expansions are currently a result
        of tight supply.<br/><br/>
        Conclusion: We remain upbeat on semiconductor materials suppliers as: 1) demandshould stay strong in the long
        run and competition is unlikely to heat up; 2) the currentcorrection is unlikely to trigger a long-term
        downturn; 3) chipmakers should ramp upinvestments next year; and 4) an end to the chipmakers share correction
        should put moreinvestor focus on topline growth at upstream players based on greater demand for rawmaterials. We
        expect sales of the semiconductor value chain under our coverage to leap21% next year, with those at SK
        Materials surging 30%.</p>
