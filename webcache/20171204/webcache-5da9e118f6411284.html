        We have updated our study on non-residents¡¯ exposure to the Soberanos curve. Although PENappreciated by 0.5%
        during October, foreign investors¡¯ exposure to PEN nominal rates decreasedfor the first time this year (Chart
        1). It currently stands at USD DV0110.3mn (up 84.1% y/y and -4.3% m/m).<br/><br/>
        At USD DV012.3mn, the recently-issued August 2032remains as the bond to which non-residentshave the highest
        exposure.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, Peru¡¯s pension fund system increased its exposure in the Soberanos curve by 2.2% inOctober. With a
        total holding of USD DV017.1mn, it retained the second-largest exposure to thenominal bond market. Pension
        funds¡¯ biggest exposure is to the August 2037bond. Local banks aremore exposed to shorter tenors of the curve.
