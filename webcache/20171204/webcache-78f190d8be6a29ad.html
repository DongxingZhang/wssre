    <p> Domestic yield growth was slightly negative in October ¡ª Our latest datashows domestic yield growth likely ended
        down slightly with closer-in bookings stilldown low single-digits. Domestic yields for November also ticked
        slightly lower, butwe still expect November yields to end around flattish. The tough y/y comp inDecember creates
        a wide range of expected outcomes, but we expect December tobe the worst month of the quarter with yields down
        low-mid single digits.<br/><br/>
        International markets continue to improve ¡ª We see real improvement takingshape in November and December
        internationally. Our latest data shows Novemberinternational yield growth is trending higher by 1-2%. December
        yields look higherby 3-4% to-date, but comps do get ~200bps tougher in the coming weeks. We seestrong yields in
        Central American and Caribbean markets. European markets alsolook improved. We think weakness in Mexico is the
        primary driver of overallsoftness to Mexico and Canada.<br/><br/>
        International no longer a drag ¡ª International exposure has generally been adrag to overall system pricing
        growth over the past few years. We think this is nolonger the case as international yield growth looks similar
        y/y to domestic. From astock perspective, we think data in this report favors Buy-rated AAL and SAVE,
        andNeutral-rated JBLU.</p>
