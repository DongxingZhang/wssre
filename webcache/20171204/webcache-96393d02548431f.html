    <p> Potential changes in tax policies and imposition of tariffs could slow thegrowth of wind and solar capacity, but
        benefit coal, natural gas and nucleargeneration. The uncertainty on policy outcomes has led to a slowdown and
        evenpause in investment activities or plans for future projects. Other considerations,mainly political, are at
        work in affecting policy outcomes.<br/><br/>
        With the potential slowdown in the growth of renewables, natural gas, coaland nuclear could benefit on both
        volumetric and price terms. The volumetriceffect could be as much as 0.5-Bcf/d per year in gas-equivalent terms,
        with coal andnuclear benefiting. Power prices may also not fall as quickly amid a slower uptakeof solar and
        wind, both of which are effectively zero marginal cost generation.<br/><br/>
        Citi estimates a 14-Bcf gas draw this week versus the 5-week average at this timelast year of 42-Bcf injection
        and the 5-year average of 12-Bcf injection.</p>
