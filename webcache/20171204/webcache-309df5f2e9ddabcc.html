    <p> indicators, such as industrial production and manufacturing PMI, herald thatsequential growth remained resilient
        during Q3, and only marginally lower thanthe 2.1%QoQ recorded in April-June. Combined with accommodative
        baseeffects from last year, this means annual headline growth looks set to exceed7% in Q3, pointing to upside
        risks to our call of 5.2% for full-year 2017.<br/><br/>
        In Russia, September data suggest that strong Q2 performance has extendedinto Q3. We expect growth to reach 2.6%
        YoY in Q3 and see full year growth at2.0%, with risks to the upside. Strong retail trade and improving
        agriculturaloutput appear to have supported Q3 growth, even as transportation and IPslowed. CEE continued to
        enjoy robust growth thanks to stimulative monetaryand fiscal stances as well as supportive Eurozone growth.<br/><br/>
        Inflation remained in check apart from Turkey where pressure for CBT to act isbuilding. In Russia inflation
        continued to surprise to the downside, reaching anew low of 2.7% in October; however, we expect inflation to
        return towardsthe 4% CBR target in 2018 allowing the CBR to continue with measured cuts.<br/><br/>
        We expect the policy rate to reach 8% by end-2017 and 6.5% by end-2018.<br/><br/>
        Rising wage-cost and demand-pull pressure may pose higher-than-expectedupside risks to core inflation across
        CEE3. CNB has already embarked on agradual tightening cycle while NBP retains a neutral stance and NBH getsready
        to ease further in expectation of some deceleration in headline CPI in thecoming months. In Turkey, annual CPI
        accelerated to a nine-year high of 11.9%YoY in October. We now expect headline inflation to end 2017 at 10.3%
        YoYand average annual inflation at 9% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Political and policy risks have been on the rise. In South Africa, we are lookingat a busy few months of rating
        decisions, the ANC December conference andthe February budget. In Turkey, notwithstanding a gradual albeit
        welcomeresolution to the visa spat between Turkey and the US, geopolitical riskpremium on Turkish assets remains
        high. In Russia we are concerned aboutthe February 2018 US Treasury reports on the impact of further sanctions
        andthe ongoing investigations into the alleged Russian meddling in US electionsand links with the Trump
        campaign. Tensions in the Middle East have broughtthe reform agenda in Saudi back to the forefront of
        discussions, and theuncertainty around the outlook for Lebanon has intensified.<br/><br/>
        After months of strong performance, EM(EA) Fixed Income came underpressure in October, providing the weakest
        monthly performance YTD. On theexternal front, driven by US dollar strength, expectations of a December hikeby
        the Fed, and concerns around US tax policy, as well as idiosyncratic reasonsparticularly across the EMEA
        high-yielders, were responsible for the selloff.<br/><br/>
        Turkish assets suffered under increased geopolitical tension with the US,elevated inflation pressure and
        unfavourable supply dynamics; the financeministry in South Africa surprised investors with an unexpectedly weak
        fiscaloutlook, increasing the risk of a downgrade to non-investment grade for localdebt already in November.
        Last but not least, concerns on an expansion of USsanctions on Russia put pressure on the Rouble. What¡¯s next?
        The externalbackdrop has deteriorated, and the outlook for EM(EA) Fixed Income is nolonger as favourable as it
        was over the summer. However, we are not yetturning extremely bearish and still see selective value in the asset
        class.<br/><br/>
        Nevertheless, we take a more cautious approach going into year-end andinitiate steepeners and short-end payers
        to hedge some of the duration risk in our bond portfolio. Russian and Polish fixed income remain our
        favouritepositions, while we dissuade investors from duration trades in South Africaahead of the risk events,
        and we turn neutral again on Turkish fixed incomeuntil we get a clearer picture on geopolitics and the CBT¡¯s
        reaction function.<br/><br/>
        In EM FX, the lack of differentiation as well as limited external triggers (e.g.<br/><br/>
        from US rates) over the past few weeks lead us to believe that the EM FX selloffhas transitioned from one driven
        by EM exposure to core rates re-pricing tobroader risk/position clearing into year-end. This creates
        opportunities, in ourview. Once positions have cleared, we believe investors will be quick to returnto the
        ¡®safer¡¯ carry longs of RUB and BRL. As such, we are constructive onboth these currencies and believe the recent
        weakness creates an attractiveopportunity to enter longs. We believe the recent depreciation in bothcurrencies
        stands out as being excessive relative to their strong ¡®defenses¡¯(solid external balances and real rates). At
        the other end of the spectrum, webelieve ILS is an attractive funder due to stretched valuation and potential
        forBoI FX intervention to ramp up (as inflation remains low). Therefore, we golong RUB vs. USD and BRL vs. ILS.
        We also stay long PLN vs. EUR, as PLNlooks cheap while having robust growth and current account
        dynamics.<br/><br/>
        In Sovereign credit, while valuation has significantly improved once again inboth Turkey (geopolitical risks)
        and South Africa (disappointing budget), weremain marketweight on both as we do not see any positive
        fundamentalimpetus, and the external backdrop has also worsened for both. We are moreconstructive on the
        high-yielding Ukraine and Egypt but continue tounderweight CEE majors (Hungary and Poland), mostly on valuation.
        Weremain neutral on Russia. In relative value, we favor long 26Ns vs. 5Y CDS andlong 24s vs. 6.25% 22s in
        Turkey; long 24s vs. 5Y CDS and long 27s vs. 22s inSouth Africa; and enter cash curve flatteners of long 47s vs.
        28s in Egypt.<br/><br/>
        Corporate Credit: Following the strongest monthly performance in September,the price action in the CEEMEA
        corporate space was rather modest in Octoberwith spread tightening of 5bps on an aggregate basis. CEEMEA
        creditunderperformed compared to the overall EM corporate index which tightenedby -13bps in Oct. We believe the
        weakness in the Turkish bond universe(spreads up 18bps) seems to have weighed on CEEMEA credits'
        overallperformance. More recently in November, the political risks have risen,particularly in the Middle East,
        which is expected to weigh on regionalcorporate spreads in the rest of 2017 and perhaps also have contagious
        effecton the rest of the CEEMEA credits. South African quasi-sovereign credits havealso come under pressure
        following the Bloomberg article on the South AfricanReserve Bank¡¯s claims that State-owned South African
        companies coulddefault on their debt obligations following the deterioration of their financialpositions. To
