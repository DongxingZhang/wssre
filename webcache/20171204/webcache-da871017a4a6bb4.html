    <p> Recent negative rating actions.<br/><br/>
        Last Friday, Moody¡¯s downgraded Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties¡¯(¡°DWCP¡±) company rating from Baa3 to Ba1; and
        also downgraded WandaHK¡¯s corporate family rating from Ba1 to Ba3. Recall that in late Sept, S&amp;Pdowngraded;
        DWCP from BBB- to BB and its subsidiary Wanda HK from BB+to BB- on uncertainty over strategic transition. The
        rating agency has anegative outlook on DWCP and Wanda HK on the back of uncertainty aroundA-share IPO timing and
        increased risks of access to funding.<br/><br/>
        Potential early repayment of off-shore loans? We are not overly worried.<br/><br/>
        Moody¡¯s reported that the downgrade of DWCP ¡°reflects our concerns overthe company¡¯s weakened liquidity position
        ¡­ arising from potential noncomplianceof certain maintenance requirements related to the company¡¯sexisting
        borrowing obligations¡± per a Bloomberg article. The potential noncompliancerefers to that for off-shore bank
        loans (from multiple banks)totaling around USD1.7bn, not to DALWAN USD bonds. Moody¡¯s did notdisclose the
        specific requirement on which Wanda Commercial Properties waspotentially non-compliant. We think it is highly
        likely for the company to get awaiver from banks in the event of a breach of a requirement or requirements
        ofsome of its off-shore loans, and we are not overly concerned that the issuerwould need to early repay its
        off-shore bank loans.<br/><br/>
        Looking at DWCP¡¯s balance sheet as of end-June 2017, it had RMB137.7bn ofcash (up 37% HoH, partly thanks to
        issuance of on-shore MTNs in 1H17),though we reckon most of this cash would be on-shore. The company¡¯s
        shorttermdebt rose by 20% HoH to RMB29.4bn as of end-June, and its totalcash/short-term debt was 468%. If some
        of its lenders of the syndicated loansrequire early repayment, then the company would need to transfer somemoney
        from on-shore to off-shore or to obtain additional money off-shore.<br/><br/>
        Guangzhou R&amp;F;, the purchaser of 77 hotel assets from DWCP, estimates itsown blended average cost of
        borrowing from both on-shore and off-shorechannels to pay for the acquisition of some DWCP hotels is around
        6%.<br/><br/>
        Having said that, we expect all or most of the payments from Guangzhou R&amp;Fto; DWCP for the hotels
        transaction to occur on-shore. Operation wise,DWCP¡¯s contract sales look in-line with our expectations.
        According to CRIC,Wanda¡¯s Jan-Aug total contract sales figure (which could differ from thecompany¡¯s official
        figure) aggregated to RMB69.5bn (ranked #14 in China).<br/><br/>
        Bond recommendations and risks.<br/><br/>
        We maintain our Buy on DALWAN 4.875% 2018s (issue rating of Ba3, B+, andBBB by Moody¡¯s, S&amp;P;, and Fitch
        respectively; ask price of 99.75 as we write,YTM: 5.1%) as we continue to believe the company will be able to
        repay itsUSD600mn 2018s without problem. We also maintain our neutral rating onDALWAN 7.25% 2024s (ask price:
        100.75, YTM: 7.1%) as we believe the longtermgrowth outlook of DWCP is uncertain given its shrunk landbank
        postassetdisposals to Sunac and R&amp;F.; Downside risks include delays or inabilityto get A-share listing,
        worse-than-expected liquidity or access to funding, andhigher-than-expected acquisitions. Upside risks include
        successful A-sharelisting by Sept 2018, stronger-than-expected liquidity or access to funding,better sales or
        margins, and conservative acquisitions.</p>
