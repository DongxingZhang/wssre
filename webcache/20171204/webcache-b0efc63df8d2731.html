    <p> Axalta and Venator outperformed in October.<br/><br/>
        US Chemicals rose 6.4% in October vs S&amp;P; up 2.2%. Notable outperformers inOctober were Axalta (AXTA,
        +15.0%, Buy) and Venator (VNTR, +10.6%, Buy).<br/><br/>
        Axalta shares rose following press reports that Akzo has approached Axaltaabout a potential merger of equals,
        which would create a $16B paints andcoatings company, similar in size to PPG and Sherwin-Williams. Venator¡¯s
        TiO2momentum remained strong in Q3 with pricing up 22% YoY and 13% QoQ asVenator realized ~$250/m.t. Q3 price
        increase. Looking ahead to seasonallysoft Q4, Venator remains confident on its announced price increases of
        $80-$180/m.t. due to high capacity utilization and declining inventories.<br/><br/>
        Industrial gases seeing accelerating U/L growth.<br/><br/>
        Lack of growth has been a key issue for industrial gas companies over the past2-plus years. Air Products¡¯ (APD,
        +5.4%, Buy) Q4 marked a solid end to ¡¯17and delivered its 14th consecutive quarter of EPS growth highlighted
        byaccelerating base business growth and new plant start-ups. Praxair¡¯s (PX,+4.6%, Hold) Q3 was highlighted by
        accelerating U/L growth. Highlighting thegrowth were volumes which rose an impressive 5% (1/3 from new
        projects,2/3 from organic growth) marking Praxair¡¯s third straight quarter of volumegains (Q1: +4%, Q2: +3%).
        This follows 8 quarters of flat-to-down volumes.<br/><br/>
        PQ Corporation: catalysts for growth.<br/><br/>
        We initiated coverage of PQ with a Buy rating and a PT of $20, upside of 20%.<br/><br/>
        PQ shares have underperformed in the 3? weeks since its IPO (-3.4% vs+2.2% for S&amp;P;) due, we believe, to
        lack of efficient execution of the IPO(attempted aggressive pricing), high leverage (4.6x net debt/EBITDA) &amp;
        belowpeer group free cash in ¡¯17-¡¯18 rather than concerns about its businesses. It isthese businesses we find
        both attractive (EBITDA margins of 28% vs peers at23%) &amp; underpriced (8.6x ¡¯18 EV/EBITDA vs peers at 11.7x).
        We believe as PQdelivers on its earnings expectations, improves its free cash flow anddeleverages to its
        targeted 3.0-3.5x range, its valuation gap vs peers will close.<br/><br/>
        Lyondell: crossing the Rubicon.<br/><br/>
        Lyondell¡¯s takeover approach to Braskem (per press reports ¨C Reuters, WallStreet Journal) marks a critical step
        in the evolution of Lyondell and its CEO,Bob Patel. An acquisition of Braskem would be large (we estimate
        $24B),strategically sound and highly accretive (we estimate ~30%). It would alsomeet Lyondell¡¯s acquisition
        criteria of i) strong fit with its core competencies,ii) large scale assets, iii) leverageable on its corporate
        structure, iv) EPSaccretive within 2 years and v) an IRR of 12%. Even if Lyondell is notsuccessful in acquiring
        Braskem, we believe the company has crossed theRubicon in its willingness to pursue large scale M&amp;A; in the
        olefins andisocyanates areas.<br/><br/>
        Valuations look reasonable, but macro weakness may limit upside.<br/><br/>
        Today¡¯s 19.4x forward P/E multiple for US Chemicals (ex-ag) is 30% above the10-year average of 14.9x. We view US
        Chemicals trading at a 2% discount tothe S&amp;P; 500 reasonable vs. a 10-year average of a 4% discount
        givenstructurally low US ethane prices.</p>
