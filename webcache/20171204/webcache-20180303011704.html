    <p> Commentary for Monday: This week¡¯s economic calendar features several keydata releases and Fedspeak. Market
        participants will also want to pay closeattention to tax reform progress in Washington. As of the time of this
        publication,the House Ways and Means Committee had voted along party lines (24-16) todeliver its bill to the
        full House. The Senate Finance Committee¡¯s proposal wasalso revealed last week and is slated for markup this
        week. Both versions areessentially opening gambits by the two chambers and the hard work begins whenthe two
        bills are ¡°reconciled¡±. As a reminder, the Senate version is likely to becloser to the final version. In our
        view, there is a decent chance that some versionof tax reform can be achieved, but this is likely to be a Q1
        event and there arenumerous potential stumbling blocks along the way.<br/><br/>
        With respect to the data, October inflation and retail sales reports are the mainfocus. Tuesday, we expect
        headline PPI (+0.1% forecast vs. +0.4% previously) tomoderate following a spike in gasoline prices last month
        due to hurricane-relatedsupply disruptions. However, core PPI inflation (+0.2% vs. +0.1%) should firm. Wewill
        focus on the healthcare services component of the PPI, as this is an input intothe corresponding series in the
        core PCE deflator¡ªthe Fed¡¯s preferred inflationmetric. Recall that healthcare has the largest weighting in the
        core PCE.<br/><br/>
        The decline in gas prices will have a similar effect on headline CPI (0.1% vs. +0.6%)released on Wednesday. Core
        CPI prices (+0.2% vs. +0.1%) are expected to firmbut the year-over-year growth rate should remain at 1.7%, down
        from 2.3% atthe beginning of the year. While we anticipate core inflation to remain tame nearterm,there are
        signs that we are reaching an inflection point on inflation. Inflationlags output growth by about six quarters,
        and in this regard, some of the recentweakness reflects the soft-patch in growth in late 2015/early
        2016.<br/><br/>
        Regarding retail sales, the headline (+0.1% vs. +1.6%) will likely cool due to motorvehicle sales, which slipped
        to a still robust 18 million units in October following asurge in hurricane impacted regions of the country.
        Sales excluding automobilesshould fare a bit better (+0.3% vs. +1.0%). Per usual, we will focus on retail
        control(+0.4% vs. +0.4%), which excludes autos, building materials and gas stations and is the portion of retail
        sales used to estimate goods spending in GDP. Marketparticipants should also be mindful of revisions, which can
        be meaningful.<br/><br/>
        There is also a spate of manufacturing data this week beginning with the NewYork Fed Empire survey (26.6 vs.
        30.2), which could slow after reaching multiyearhighs. Thursday¡¯s Philadelphia Fed survey (23.5 vs. 27.9) is
        also expected toslip but still remain firmly in growth territory. The six-month outlook for capitalspending in
        the latter survey is notable as this has been near historic highs overthe past several months and is a reliable
        leading indicator of capex spending.<br/><br/>
        Also on Thursday, we get the October industrial production (+0.8% vs. +0.3%)report, which should post a sturdy
        gain given the increase in manufacturing hoursworked and utilities output last month. Indeed, there could be
        upside risk givenhurricane disruptions to the energy and chemical refining complexes.<br/><br/>
        Rounding out this week¡¯s data releases are Thursday¡¯s NAHB housing marketindex (66 vs. 68) and Friday¡¯s housing
        starts (1.220 million vs. 1.127 million) andbuilding permits (1.230 million vs. 1.225 million). We have recently
        noted someweakness in the housing data, and given that the NAHB has come out opposedto the House GOP plans to
        limit the mortgage interest deduction, sentiment couldslip. That said, we anticipate a modest bounce in building
        activity, which shouldget a slight tailwind near-term from rebuilding efforts in hurricane-impactedregions.<br/><br/>
        This week's Fedspeak may shed more light on monetary policymakers¡¯ views ona December rate hike. Fed Chair
        Yellen and Chicago Fed President Evans (voter)appear on Tuesday at an ECB conference on ¡°Communications
        Challenges forPolicy Effectiveness, Accountability and Reputation¡±. We may not get much fromeither given the
        topic. However, while Yellen appears intent on steering the FOMCin the direction of another rate hike next
        month, Evans has been lukewarm giventhe soft-patch in inflation. We may hear more from Evans on Wednesday whenhe
        appears at a conference but his remarks will come before the CPI release.<br/><br/>
        St. Louis¡¯ Bullard (non-voter) will be speaking later Tuesday morning on the USeconomy and monetary policy and
        though he is admittedly the most dovish atthe Fed, his presentations are often insightful.<br/><br/>
        Also of importance will be Atlanta¡¯s recently-minted President Bostic, who willbe an FOMC voter next year. Our
        initial read on Bostic is that he leans slightlyhawkish but market participants have not heard much from him.
        Cleveland FedPresident Mester will join Bostic on the FOMC next year and will deliver a keynoteabout monetary
        policy at the Cato Institute on Thursday. Rounding out the Fedspeakers this week are Dallas¡¯ Kaplan (voter)
        along with Governor Brainard andSan Francisco¡¯s Williams (non-voter). Like Evans, Kaplan has also expressed
        somereservations about a December rate hike so we will pay close attention to histake on the latest inflation
        data. Governor Brainard will be giving keynote remarksat a fintech conference on Thursday, so her comments will
        not likely touch onmonetary policy, although it is possible she discusses her views in the Q&amp;A.;<br/><br/>
        Williams will be speaking at the Asia Economic Policy Conference and givenhe is an influential regional
        president rotating onto the Committee next year,his remarks will be closely followed. In fact, last week
        Williams gave a strongindication that he supported three hikes next year.</p>
