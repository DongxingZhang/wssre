    <p> With the Fed sticking to their script of continued gradual rate hikes,attention has been focused on how high the
        fed funds rate will rise inthe coming quarters. However, a more crucial question for growth andmarkets is how
        high the 10-year Treasury yield will rise, and at what levelit would begin to restrain growth.<br/><br/>
        Answers to these questions require having a view on the neutral levelof the 10-year Treasury yield 每 the level
        at which yields keep inflation attarget, growth at potential and the unemployment rate at NAIRU. Thatis, the
        neutral 10-year yield is the level at which bond yields switch frombeing growth-supportive to
        growth-restrictive. We label this neutral 10-year Treasury yield "10y-star", and take a first step in estimating
        it byextending a popular methodology for computing its analogue for the fedfunds rate, r-star.<br/><br/>
        Our estimates imply that 10y-star is currently around 1.5%, about 1.3percentage points above current r-star
        estimates. Assuming that the Fedachieves its inflation target on average, this estimate is consistent with
        anominal neutral 10-year Treasury yield around 3.5%.<br/><br/>
        According to our analysis there is therefore considerable room for longertermbond yields to rise without
        exerting a meaningful drag on growth.<br/><br/>
        However, it is likely that the rate of change in bond yields 每 not justthe level 每 also matters. As such, a
        sharp rise in yields even to levelsbelow neutral could prove disruptive to markets and the economy, at
        leasttemporarily. Offsetting this possibility is the fact that financial conditionsare now at the easiest (i.e.,
        most growth supportive) levels on recordaccording to our financial conditions index (FCI). There is room for
        loosefinancial conditions to absorb a rise in yields before it adversely affectsgrowth prospects.<br/><br/>
        10y-star shares several similarities with r-star estimates. First, 10y-startrended lower over the decades prior
        to the financial crisis. Second, bothestimates plunged to record lows in response to the financial crisis,
        andthere are only tentative signs that they have risen from the post-crisislows. Finally, as we have emphasized
        in recent work on r-star, there is alsoconsiderable uncertainty around 10y-star estimates. We highlight
        oneadditional source of uncertainty in our estimates 每 the choice of inflationexpectations to construct the real
        10-year Treasury yield.</p>
