    <p> US crude oil inventories rose 1.9-m bbls to 459-m bbls (against the average ofBloomberg survey expectations of a
        1.8-m bbl draw), the second week ofbuilds after a string of almost all draws since mid-September, and
        morebroadly since the peak at the end of March 2017 of 536-m bbls. (This wassmaller than industry estimates of a
        6.5-m bbl build yesterday though.) Meanwhile,the Strategic Petroleum Reserve sold 0.7-m bbls of crude oil,
        meaning that total UScrude stockpiles, including the SPR, built by a smaller 1.1-m bbls to 1,128-m
        bbls.<br/><br/>
        Similarly, total US crude and product inventories, excluding NGLs, showedthe first build in 23 weeks, up 5.4-m
        bbls to 1,703-m bbls, though this is down195-m bbls since the February peak, and down 85-m bbls y/y.<br/><br/>
        Trade flows have also been shifting. US crude imports jumped 0.5-m b/d w/wto 7.9-m b/d, driven by the Gulf and
        West Coasts. PADD III waterborne importswere up 0.2-m b/d w/w to 2.6-m b/d, off recent subdued levels of
        2.3-2.4-m b/dsince late Sept. Saudi crude exports to the US have recently fallen to multi-decadelows, with
        October seeing just 525-k b/d, in an apparent effort to draw downconspicuous US oil inventories. However, Saudi
        inflows have been above 0.7-m b/dagain in November. Meanwhile, crude imports from Canada remain strong at
        almost3.4-m b/d, with 2.6-m b/d flowing into PADD II. Meanwhile, US crude exports havecome off highs of 2-m b/d,
        but jumped 0.3-m b/d w/w to 1.1-m b/d.<br/><br/>
        Cushing crude stocks began drawing strongly, down 1.5-m bbls w/w to 63-mbbls as refinery runs are picking up
        post-maintenance, up 0.3-m b/d w/w to16.6-m b/d, including a 0.2-m b/d rise in PADD II and a 0.1-m b/d rise in
        PADD III.<br/><br/>
        This increased the pull on Cushing enough to swing it from a 0.8-m bbl build theprior week to a 1.5-m bbl draw
        this week, with little change in observable pipe flows;another factor could be the beginning of line fill for
        the 200-k b/d Diamond pipelineto Memphis, expected to start flowing from December. The prompt Brent-WTIspread
        remains wider than $6, but should narrow over time as regional pipeline andexport infrastructure improve, even
        as US shale supply is growing again.<br/><br/>
        Gasoline inventories rose 0.9-m bbls to 210-m bbls (against surveyed estimatesof a 1-m bbl draw) as apparent
        domestic demand fell 0.3-m b/d w/w to 9.17-m b/d,down 0.04-m b/d y/y; the 4WMA stands at 9.36, up 0.28-m b/d
        y/y. At the sametime, gasoline blending components were blended at a much lower rate last week,down 0.7-m b/d to
        0.3-m b/d. Total gasoline inventories remain around the five-yearaverage, and should seasonally build to
        year-end as refinery supply picks up afterfall maintenance ends.<br/><br/>
        Diesel inventories fell 0.8-m bbls to 125-m bbls (against surveyed estimates of a2-m bbl draw) as apparent
        domestic demand fell 0.5-m b/d w/w to 4-m b/d; 4WMAdemand stands at 4.04-m b/d, up 0.02-m b/d y/y. Inventories
        are on the low side,and exports are near record highs, with strong pull from Latin America.</p>
