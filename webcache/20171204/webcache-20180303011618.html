    <p> Model cycles determine winners ¡ª This Deep Dive focuses on the auto modelcycles in India and Indonesia, the two
        largest auto markets in South Asia. Modelcycles are key to understanding OEMs¡¯ competitive positioning in any
        auto market.<br/><br/>
        On our analysis, the best plays on the auto (PV) cycle in India are Maruti Suzukiand parent Suzuki Motor, which
        derives c.65% of its OP from Maruti. In Indonesia,we continue to have a Sell on Astra because the new model
        cycle does not favorthe company. We expect it to lose market share (to 50% or below, from 55-56%) inthe 4W
        market, as Wuling and Mitsubishi started product deliveries in Oct.<br/><br/>
        India and Indonesia represent a solid growth opportunity ¡ª They are South /South East Asia¡¯s largest and most
        dynamic auto markets. PV penetration per 100people is modest ¨C around 2.5% / 4.0% in India / Indonesia
        respectively, vs. almost10% in China. Growth over the next three years is also forecast at a very healthy11% /
        ~9% CAGRs for India / Indonesia. This compares favorably with the c7%CAGR forecast in China, and ~2% global auto
        sales growth.<br/><br/>
        Both markets are a stronghold for Japanese OEMs ¡ª Indonesia and India aredominated by Japanese OEMs. Per Fourin,
        India is around 6% of sales forJapanese OEMs, whilst Indonesia is around 4%. Although Indonesia is a muchsmaller
        market than India, the Japanese dominate the market (~94% share) vs. the~65% share they have in India.<br/><br/>
        Right now, though, India has better prospects ¡ª India is ahead not just due tobetter growth, but also due to
        premiumisation. In India, cars are becoming larger,moving from 800cc engines to 1 / 1.2l engines. Sedans are
        also shifting to compactand small-size SUVs. In Indonesia, there is a downtick in mix, especially after
        theadvent of LCGCs (4 of top 10 models from this segment), representing around 23%of PV sales for 1H17.</p>
