    <p> So far, large junkets seeing softer-than-expected VIP trends in Golden Week.<br/><br/>
        Golden Week started solidly (visitation +5% yoy on Oct 1-3rd) but ran into aspeed bump on Oct 4th (visitation
        -22% yoy) as many Chinese stayed home withfamilies on this day of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Thankfully,
        visitation recoveredthe day after (+18% yoy on Oct 5th), bringing cumulative visitation growth backto +2% yoy
        (-1% yoy for mainland Chinese) for Oct 1-5th, though still belowmarket expectations (+4% yoy). More importantly,
        our checks with Macau's twolargest junket operators confirmed that VIP trends have so far been
        softer-thanexpectations.<br/><br/>
        We now expect Golden Week GGR to grow only 10-13% yoy, belowthe bullish market expectations (&gt;15% yoy). As
        mentioned in our report onTuesday (Golden Week kicked off, 3 Oct 2017), we expect the sector to take abreather
        after Golden Week after the 16% sector rally in Sept (MSCI HK +1%).<br/><br/>
        We expect stocks to pull back into 3Q results season (late Oct to early Nov). Werecommend Buying our top picks
        MGM China (Buy) &amp; Wynn Macau (Buy) on dipson potential re-rating next year, driven by FCF improvements and
        dividend hikes.<br/><br/>
        Solid overnight visitation; but weak same-day visitation.<br/><br/>
        According to the travel agencies we spoke to, overnight visitation growthremained solid over Golden Week. This
        echoes with our proprietary hotel survey(see report Golden Week: Hotel Survey 20 Sept 2017) which showed
        strongbookings for the nights of Oct 3-5th. However, these travel agencies said thatsame-day visitation were
        weaker-than-expected, esp during the day of Oct 4th(Mid-Autumn Festival) as many visitors from the nearby
        Guangdong province(including HK) chose to stay home with families on this festive day. Thankfully,both overnight
        and same-day visitation have recovered immediately afterwards,and this coming weekend should be back to a mild
        growth.<br/><br/>
        Buy MGM China on pullbacks on near-term weakness.<br/><br/>
        Macau stocks have jumped 16% during Sept, significantly outperforming MSCIHK by 15ppt. While more consensus
        upgrades will likely come as Streetexpectations (+9%) for 2018 GGR still trails DB forecasts (+13%), the sector
        maypull back due to weaker-than-expected Golden Week. If stocks pull back, werecommend investors to Buy MGM
        China on a 12-month horizon as we thinkMGM Cotai will take market share from Sands in 1H18 and from Galaxy
        in2H18 after it adds junkets in mid-2018. We value Macau stocks on SOTP. Keydownside risks include regulatory
        changes and faster-than-expected slowdown inGGR growth. Upside risk is Oct GGR growth remains strong, despite
        mild GoldenWeek visitation growth.</p>
