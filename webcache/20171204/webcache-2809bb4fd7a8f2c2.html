    <p> PizzaExpress¡¯s Q3 UK LFLs were negative as we had feared, but adj. EBITDAwas a beat to our estimate and margin
        performance was consistent withmanagement guidance. Despite lowering our FY18/19 estimates below and apositive
        reaction in the bonds today, we continue to like the risk-reward andreiterate CreditBuy on both the Senior
        Secured (96/7.9%) and Senior(89/11.7%) notes. For the quarter ended 1st October, sales of ¡ê140m were up3.6% yoy,
        but UK &amp; Ireland lfls slipped to -1.3% (at cFX) from +0.9% in H1reflecting a challenging market in London in
        particular. International lfls werealso soft at +0.7% (V H1 5.0%), but according to management this
        largelyreflected the later timing of China¡¯s Mid-Autumn Festival in Q4 this year.<br/><br/>
        Group Adj. EBITDA of ¡ê25.5m was down ¡ê1m yoy but ahead of our ¡ê24.7mest., as a ¡ê2m decrease in the UK &amp;
        Ireland (¡ê23.3m) was partly offset by a¡ê1m increase in the International business (¡ê2.1m). As guided
        bymanagement, the UK &amp; Ireland EBITDA margin deficit improved from -460bp(yoy) in H1 to -190bp in Q3,
        reflecting the termination of dual running costs forthe new EPOS system as well as efficiencies which offset
        organic inflation(e.g. labour, rates, ingredients) of c. 300bp. Compared with Q2, net debtincreased by ¡ê16m to
        ¡ê645m mainly reflecting coupon payments whileSenior/Sub net leveraged increased to 4.7x/6.8x from 4.5x/6.6x.
        Managementupdated site opening plans with the UK likely to fall to just six next year from c.<br/><br/>
        12 in FY17, while International will increase to c. 40 from c. 32 this year; weest. total capex will be ¡ê44m
        this year and ¡ê42m in FY18. The company alsodisclosed that it sold the Firezza business, which comprised 22
        mainly takeawaysites in London and was making a negative contribution to LTM EBITDA.<br/><br/>
        We were generally impressed by new CEO Jinlong Wang who unsurprisinglyemphasised the growth opportunity in China
        where he was previously actingCEO, but also seems well-acquainted with the challenges in the UK. On theoutlook,
        management indicated negative lfls and margin erosion (c. 200bp) willpersist in the UK in Q4, but also indicated
        growth in China should broadlyoffset UK weakness next year. In our updated forecasts below, we see
        adj.<br/><br/>
        EBITDA of ¡ê92m both this year and next, with operating cash flow moderatelynegative at -¡ê5m to -¡ê8m and
        Senior/Sub net leverage remaining high at4.6x/6.8x. However, we believe the core credit story remains intact
        with astrong core brand and growth in China likely to make a material contributionahead of the 2021 bond
        maturities.</p>
