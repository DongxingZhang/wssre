    <p> GLP bonds have tightened 15bp in the past month. They still look cheaprelative to similar rated China property
        peers (Sino Ocean Land 2024s @185bp, Longfor 2022s @ 160, China Jinmao 2022s @ 155) and higher ratedglobal comps
        (Prologis 2025s @ 70bp, Goodman Group 2028s @ 130). We seefair value closer to Sino Ocean Land, implying around
        20bp potential upside.<br/><br/>
        Our base case remains for the ratings to end up at Baa3/BBB, possibly with anegative outlook from Moody¡¯s. Just
        in case Moody¡¯s takes GLP to Ba1 andthis becomes a crossover credit, spreads could widen by about 15bp,
        lookingat Shimao 2022s @ 220bp. Key downside risks are rating downgrades lowerthan our expectation, lack of
        transparency post privatization, continuedaggressive growth appetite, rising contribution from financial
        services, etc.<br/><br/>
        Please see our initiation report from Oct 12, 2017 for more detailed views.<br/><br/>
        Earnings call takeaways: Biggest takeaway for us was management¡¯scommitment to maintaining IG ratings ¨C this was
        stated several times on thecall. GLP intends to achieve this through continued asset sales to the
        REITs,syndication of Gazeley portfolio and establishment of China funds. On Gazeley,plan is to syndicate out 85%
        stake BY Apr¡¯18 and it seems there is stronginterest from investors such as sovereign wealth funds &amp; pension
        funds.<br/><br/>
        Recollect that Gazeley is a ~USD2.8 billion acquisition to be funded withUSD1.6 billion equity and USD1.2
        billion debt, implying GLP¡¯s 15% share ofthe equity at USD240 million, which is quite manageable in our view. As
        forthe China funds, this has been talked about for a while, but the CEO guidedthat it¡¯s in the final stages,
        partners have already been identified and should belaunched within months. It will likely involve both growth
        and income funds.<br/><br/>
        Key management changes: Current CFO, Heather Xie will become Chairmanand CFO of GLP Financial Services. Global
        Treasurer and CFO for Japan, KazTsutsumi will step in as the new CFO for GLP starting Jan 1, 2018. Given
        Kaz¡¯scurrent role and experience, we won¡¯t read too much into this change.<br/><br/>
        Operations: GLP¡¯s consolidated portfolio grew to USD42.9 billion fromUSD41.7 billion at Jun¡¯17 (excluding the
        newly acquired Europe platform) witha healthy lease profile. Group lease ratio improved 1ppt qoq to 91%,
        withChina portfolio being 87% leased (+3ppt qoq) after few quarters of decline, andother regions recording
        stable ratios. Rent growth on renewal was 10.4% yoyin this quarter and same-property NOI rose 4.6% yoy in
        1HFY18. Separately,GLP has met 25% and 49% of its FY18 development starts (USD2.2 billion) andcompletions
        (USD1.7 billion) targets respectively. Though management isconfident of meeting the full year target for
        development starts, we won¡¯t besurprised if it falls short and might be indirectly positive for the credit.<br/><br/>
        Separately, the fund management AUM stands at USD39.3 billion. WithUSD28.6 billion invested and balance
        uncalled, denoting significant ability tosell assets into the funds.<br/><br/>
        Financials: GLP reported EBITDA of USD135 million (+8% qoq) on revenues ofUSD282 million (+8% qoq), and EBITDA
        margin was stable at 48%. Chinaaccounted for 75% of the revenues. Fund management fee grew slightly fromUSD48
        million to USD50 million, implying USD200 million in annual recurringincome. Total debt increased slightly to
        USD6.0 billion from USD5.9 billion,given dividend payment of USD226 million in this quarter offset partly by
        positive FCF of USD130 million. Weighted average interest cost is 3%. Cashfinished the quarter at USD1.1
        billion, almost unchanged, or 62% of ST Debt.<br/><br/>
        Look through net gearing was also unchanged at 36% and within policy tokeep this ratio lower than 40%.</p>
