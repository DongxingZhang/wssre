    <p> Cash balance as at Sep 30, stood at USD339 million, of which USD77 millionwas restricted with futures brokers,
        implying just USD262 million in free cash.<br/><br/>
        The sharp decline during the quarter was mainly caused by repayment of someBBFs. Interestingly, there was also
        an outflow of USD161 million of cash withfutures brokers for the sale of NAGP to Mercuria vs. USD102 million
        received.<br/><br/>
        Separately, of the existing cash balance, only USD76 million sits at the holdco,though we assume it won't be
        difficult for Noble to take cash out fromsubsidiaries, albeit some of these might be jurisdictions like China.
        Plus,additional vessel debt of USD65 million has been taken over as the companyacquired one of the JVs, taking
        total vessel debt to USD126 million, but thisshould be covered by the value of underlying vessels.<br/><br/>
        Looking ahead into the next couple of quarters before the 2018s mature inMarch, the USD83 million sitting in
        escrow with Mercuria should come in(management guided this should happen near term). As for the sale of the
        oilbusiness to Vitol, we estimate the proforma number at USD400 million asfollows: USD202 million in base
        consideration as announced + USD829 millionin net working capital (per MDA statement, assuming this doesn't
        includecash) + USD185 million of cash balance ¨C USD636 million debt ¨C USD180million for escrow and
        insurance.<br/><br/>
        As for underlying Asia operations, if we take roughly the same adjustedEBITDA as 3Q (negative USD40 million) for
        the next couple of quarters, interestoutgo of USD50 million per quarter and no working capital changes,
        Noblecould lose around USD180 million in cash. We derive 3Q EBITDA by adding allof the ~USD30 million
        depreciation &amp; amortization to adjusted gross loss ofUSD7 million and deducting USD63 million of SGA
        expenses. Note that 3QOCF (pre-interest expense) of positive USD322 million hasn¡¯t been brokendown into
        continuing vs. discontinued businesses, though most of this wasdriven by working capital inflows of USD508
        million in the oil&amp; gas operations.<br/><br/>
        On other asset sales, we think it won't be easy to monetize the stakes inJamalco and Harbor Energy in the next
        3-6 months. However, sale of stake invarious listed companies could fetch USD50-100 million (say USD75 million
        forour calculations). We also believe any recapitalization of the Asia businesswon¡¯t happen without a
        simultaneous debt restructuring.<br/><br/>
        Adding everything up, cash balance could stand at approx. USD640 million atthe end of March. As is evident, we
        have made a number of assumptions inthis analysis. One could argue this cash will be sufficient to pay
        USD379million of the 2018s, but the RCF lenders are unlikely to allow that in our view.<br/><br/>
        Covenant waiver from them expires on Dec 20 next month, which is the nextkey event to watch (other than the
        final proceeds to be received from Vitol).</p>
