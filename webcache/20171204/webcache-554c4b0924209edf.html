    <p> WH Group is the largest pork supplier in the world, with packaged meats accountingfor 51% of revenues and76% of
        operating profits. The pick-up in WH Group¡¯s hog production in the US and lower pork prices in China, should
        support marginexpansion. As a consumer staplescompany, WH Group¡¯s growth is not the most exciting, but with
        profit growthgoingback to the 10%CAGR level for2017-2020, and the Company trading at a significant discountto
        its international peers, we see valueat 14x PER (implying only 10x PER for Smithfield and other stub
        operations).<br/><br/>
        WH Group is the largest global manufacturerofpork and packaged meats, with vertically integrated operations in
        China and the US. These two are theworld¡¯slargest and third largest producermarkets, accounting for 45% and 11%
        of global production, respectively. The Company owns 73% of Shuanghui, which is the largest packaged meat
        producer in China, and acquired Smithfieldfor US$4.7bn in 2013.<br/><br/>
        Packaged meats accountfor 51% of WH Group¡¯s revenues (sales of fresh pork another 43%) and almost 76% of
        operatingprofit. This is evenly balanced between China and the US, with the latter¡¯s weighting increasing from
        38% two years ago. Sales volume should reach 3.2m tonnes, up 1-2% YoY. However, the Company benefited from lower
        average hog pricesin China (US$2.3 per kg, down 18%YoY),while US prices wereup 7%YoY (US$1.23 per kg). We
        believe packaged meats willcontinue to drive profit growth in 2017E, as China-related sales benefited fromlower
        inputprices in 1H and higher sales in China in 2H.</p>
