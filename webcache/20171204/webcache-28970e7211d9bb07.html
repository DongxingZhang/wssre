    <p> Our China trip showed us mediocre expectations in the physical market.<br/><br/>
        We visited Beijing, Tanshan, Erdos, Jinan, Shanghai in early Nov, to try to figureout expectations for 4Q17 and
        2018. We found that, generally, the physicalcommodity market was quite calm and realistic. Three major common
        commentsmight deviate from our previous perceptions: (1) the demand slowdown in lateOct was well observed and
        created oversupply before winter for the physicalmarkets of several commodities. (2) For winter shutdown, the
        farther from Beijing,the higher the likelihood of loose execution by local government. For example,Shandong
        seems to be looser than Hebei in terms of winter shutdowns. (3) Asa result of the previous two points, the
        expectation of a winter demand/supplyimbalance seems to be lower than we thought. Overall, after the trip, we
        haveShenhua, Baosteel, and Maanshan as our top picks.<br/><br/>
        Overall demand - slowed down for winter but steady for 2018.<br/><br/>
        Commodity traders generally commented that downstream demand has slowedearlier than in previous years because
        inventory digestion in Oct seemed to beslower than before. However, the slowdown can be explained by the
        Chinesegovernment's initiative of slowing construction activities to manage winterpollution in northern Chinese
        cities. As for the demand outlook into 2018,most comments that we got indicated steady 2018 demand. For the
        propertysector, new starts will not decline due to low house inventory. For infrastructure,existing projects can
        sustain construction activities into 1H18 even though newconstruction orders will indeed slow down due to the
        government's efforts todeleverage local governments. The construction machinery sector will still be
        inreplacement cycle in 2018 to keep demand strong (5-10% YoY). For the autosector, the growth into 2018 will
        maintain at a low single-digit level (2-3% YoY).<br/><br/>
        Yet, 2018's manufacturing capex will likely still be upbeat and help to supportdemand.<br/><br/>
        Coal - price weakness for a short while.<br/><br/>
        The coal producers that we visited all held the view that limited incrementalcapacities will turn into effective
        supply, especially in the near term. All SOE coalproducers have largely achieved their annual target in terms of
        production targetsand financial targets. As such, they will have very low motivation to stretch theircapacities,
        with the risk of potential safety issues. As for demand, abnormallystrong hydro power has made thermal coal
        demand slow down. As such, QHDprices have been weak since late Oct. Nevertheless, the unwinding of strong hydro
        power into late Nov and Dec might trigger coal consumption to pick upquickly. As such, QHD prices into late Nov
        might strengthen again. As for themid-to-long term outlook, the Chinese government's ability to bring up
        morecoal capacity remains to be seen. A significant capex increase will be neededfor incremental effective
        supply to take place. Meanwhile, coal chemical projectsalso consumed some incremental coal supply. This is not
        well observed by themarket and could be a factor further tightening Chinese coal demand/supply in ahigher
        chemical price environment.<br/><br/>
        Steel - inventory after mid-Nov is key.<br/><br/>
        Tangshan steel mills mostly believe the winter shutdown will still be strict. Thegeneral impression from steel
        producers/traders is that the government will notbe as strict on shutdown measures against SOE producers and
        whichever privatesteel mills help to supply municipal heating services in winter. For these steelmills, the
        winter shutdown might only account for 20-30% of their capacity.<br/><br/>
        For other private mills in Tangshan, a 50-70% shutdown is highly likely. Steelmills plan to increase scrap usage
        to offset the loss of pig iron (products out ofblast furnaces). However, the incremental steel product output
        increase resultingfrom higher scrape usage can be quite limited because most steel mills havemaximised scrap
        usage in the past months. We also found in Jinan that mostwinter shutdowns for steel mills might be less than
        30%. Thus, we believe theoverall impact of winter shutdowns might be lower than it seemed when thepolicy was
        announced. That is why steel inventory after mid-Nov will become animportant barometer of real demand/supply
        balance. Our current view remainsthat steel demand/supply will remain tight into 4Q17 to keep the high
        profitabilityof Chinese steel mills.<br/><br/>
        Aluminum / alumina - correction risk looms but still expect improving SD inwinter.<br/><br/>
        Aluminum industry participants (3rd-party consultants and commodity traders)we met were a bit worried about
        near-term alumina and aluminum pricemomentum given: 1) the alumina price already accounts for c.24% of
        thealuminum price, a record high and Lv Liang removed "30% alumina cut" from itslatest announcement. Lv Liang is
        an alumina focus city in Shanxi, which does notbelong to 2+26 but volunteered to participate in the heating
        season and cut 30%alumina earlier; 2) from a province perspective, Shandong, which is an aluminumfocus province,
        seems to be looser for now; and 3) aluminum inventory in Chineselocal warehouses remains at 1.7mt+. Upside risk
        comes from bad air qualityas this is the key focus of central government and thus a mandatory target forlocal
        government, mentioned by the environmental policy advisor. Overall, we stillexpect the aluminum DS balance and
        inventory to improve during the heatingseason despite a near-term pullback. Next March, prices will be a bit
        risky as aresults of a lack of cost support from alumina, carbon anode, or even coal postthe heating season.</p>
