    <p> Citi＊s Take 每 The incremental nature of data from novel IO combinations isintensifying the interest in
        biomarkers and personalized immuno-oncology. Wecontinue to believe that BMY has included TMB (baseline tumor
        mutational load)within the primary endpoint of their 1st line NSCLC trial CHECKMATE-227 (Alert:BMY:
        CHECKMATE-227 Odds Maybe Just Got a Whole Lot Better. Reiterate BUY).<br/><br/>
        The elucidation of PDx resistance mechanism is forcing clinical pipelines to largelypivot away from inhibitory
        checkpoints towards the mutation-neoantigen-IFNgammaaxis (vaccines, oncolytic viruses, STING, TLR and RIG-I) and
        synthetic T cellactivation (bispecifics and cell therapy). We prefer Buy-rated AZN and Bayer amongthe EU majors.
        We prefer Buy-rated BMY, LLY and MRK in the US.<br/><br/>
        Baseline mutational load clearly on the minds of FDA 每 We were struck by theFDA session on biomarker use in the
        clinical setting. Following September＊s FDAindustry meeting, the agency is committed to ※pre-competitive§
        initiatives, toharmonize the TMB diagnostic and cut-off points upfront to avoid the confusionexperience from
        PD-L1 IHC experience. We anticipate that similar to CML, liquidassays will inform therapeutic management of many
        solid tumors within the next 5years.<br/><br/>
        BMY establishing Foundation One as validated TMB diagnostic每BMYpresented details from a bridging analysis to
        show calibration of Foundation OneF1) to whole exome sequencing (WES). The analysis concluded high
        concordancebetween F1 and WES, and supports harmonization of data across platform. Thelower cost and tissue
        requirements for Foundation One reduce practical barriers toadoption, however the current 12 day turnaround time
        remain problematic forclinicians.<br/><br/>
        Early winners and losers 每 We were struck by recent publications highlighting40% prevalence of HLA LOH as a PDx
        resistance mechanism in NSCLC. We wereintrigued by claims that RIG-1 (Merck licensed Rigontec) activation could
        restoreHLA expression and overcome resistance. On the clinical side, we found themonotherapy efficacy from
        Corvus＊s A2A receptor inhibitor CPI-444 andcombination data from ARMO＊s AM0010 (IL10) and Nektar＊s NKTR-214
        (IL2agonist) notable. BMY/ Five Prime＊s CSF1R combo in heavily pre-treatedpancreatic cohort (MSS) showing
        limited but deep and durable responses in aknown very poor responders to PDx monotherapy. On the disappointing
        sideMerck＊s KGaA＊s PD-L1/ TGF-beta fell short of initial hopes given limited responses.<br/><br/>
        However, similar to Roche＊s TCB CEA, the spider plots are more encouraging. Fulldetails of individual sessions
        are available on request.</p>
