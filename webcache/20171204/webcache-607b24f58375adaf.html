    <p> Europe Strategy - Early Morning Reid - Jim Reid<br/><br/>
        A reminder that we published our 2018Credit Outlook "The Shrinking SafetyNet" on Monday. To recap we expect
        spreads to tighten in Q1before reachingan inflection point in Q2as US inflation starts to beat on the upside and
        thecompound impact of the reduction of global central bank support starts to bite.Overall we expect EUR non-fin.
        IG corporate bond spreads to end the year +25bpand HY +100bp. We expect total returns across the European credit
        spectrumto be negative (Euro HY -0.3%) although excess returns should remain positivewith IG outperforming HY on
        a risk-adjusted basis. Please see the full note whichshould be in your mailboxes at between 9-9:30am on Monday
        morning .<br/><br/>

        From EUR balance of payments data and Japanese Life insurance numbers,the modest adjustments in asset allocation
        and hedge ratios over the last 6months suggest there is still plenty of potential for EUR buying from
        participantswith longer-term investment time horizons. The 'tinder' is there, it just lacks animmediate spark.
        Small shifts in hedge ratios on very large stocks of assets canhave extraordinarily large flow effects that
        dwarf the flows associated with themore widely watched shifts in asset allocation. As an example, foreigners
        outsidethe EUR area are calculated to own more than EUR 5trn in both equity and fixedincome assets respectively,
        so that small adjustments on the hedge ratios on thisEUR 10+ trillion stock of portfolio liabilities have
        substantial flow ramifications.<br/><br/>

        One theme this year has been the pick up in global trade, with the export cyclerecovering from post-crisis lows
        . On the demand side, this improvement hasbeen geographically lopsided. Breaks down the contributions of global
        imports bycountry. Asian (and Chinese) demand has been an even larger driver than in the2010-2012trade boom,
        which followed the massive post-crisis China stimuluspackage. Figure 3provides a comparison to 2007and shows how
        much tradehas shifted horizons. A decade ago, Asian demand made up just 30% of exportgrowth. Today, it is 60%.
