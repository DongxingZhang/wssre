    <p> Europe - Weekly Fund Flows - Andreas Bruckner<br/><br/>
        Over the past two weeks US equity funds have gained further inflows as US macrosurprises continued to move
        upwards, while their European counterparts havenow suffered redemptions for two weeks, despite the fact that
        strong Euro areaPMIs for November led Euro area macro surprises to a new seven-year high. Whilefund investors
        have been sensitive to political uncertainties in the past (and muchis to say about Germany's government
        formation, the UK's Brexit divorce bill andthe Ireland question), we think the disengagement has at least partly
        to do witha diminished belief in ever stronger PMIs, which are already consistent with GDPgrowth well above
        trend growth and forecasts. We believe the flow rotation backinto the US has legs, as our expected fade in
        relative growth momentum suggestsfurther relative outflows for Europe.<br/><br/>

        If there is an unbiased way to measure OPEC's struggle to support the marketwhile also constraining emergent US
        supply, it is shown in the price performanceof the current cycle versus previous supply tightening cycles. Since
        implementingsupply restraint in January 2017, Brent front month prices have risen by 12%. Thisstands in the
        middle of the pack relative to previous cycles<br/><br/>
        Europe Strategy - Early Morning Reid - Jim Reid<br/><br/>
        Another full day in the US today and on the last flight home tonight after dinner.There's a strong possibility
        that this will be the first trip I've made to the States fora very long time where I won't come back with a new
        Apple product. Still threequartersof a day to get through before I can categorically confirm this. I want tobuy
        the new iWatch as an upgrade to my first generation one but given we've justbought a new house, have extensive
        renovation works to come and haven't yetsold our current house, every item of spending gets analysed at the
        kitchen tableat the moment. Nappies are currently seen as a higher priority in our householdthan a new iWatch.
        Now if Apple did iNappies.....</p>
