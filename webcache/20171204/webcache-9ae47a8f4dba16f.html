        On this there has been a lot of noise around the HY market in the past week or soas a combination of macro
        factors along with some notable earnings misses haveweighed on the market. iTraxx Crossover and CDX HY have
        widened by around25bps and 30bps respectively from their most recent tights, while the price levelof the largest
        USD HY ETF (HYG US) is basically back to the same level as whereit started the year, however this overstates the
        move in the US cash market andeven more so in Europe. Looking in more detail at the cash market US HY haswidened
        by around 60bps and EUR HY is 46bps wider from the recent cycle tightsonly a few weeks back but both are still
        around 25bps and 100bps tighter on theyear respectively.<br/><br/>

        One feature of FX markets lately has been the lack of a clear dollar trend. Thecross-correlation between
        different FX pairs and the dollar has fallen to its lowestlevel ever. Exchange rates move in concert against the
        world¡¯s reserve currencyto varying degrees over time, but have only been pulling in different directionsonce
        before (in 2014)<br/><br/>

        India Inc's (Nifty 50universe) aggregate revenue, EBITDA and PAT increased10%, 15% and 12% yoy in 2QFY18. This
        is significantly higher than the declineof 11% yoy, seen in 1QFY18. This quarter was peculiar as it reflected
        the GSTtransition and as a corollary the likely impact of destocking ahead of the GSTimplementation. While
        earnings growth is lower than our expectation of 17%yoy, the breadth is encouraging. Consumers, Exporters and
        Utilities sectors faredbetter than our expectations, while Financials, Metals and Energy lagged. Apositive
        margin surprise was one of the distinctive features of this quarterlyreporting season. Revenue growth momentum
        was muted for most sectors.</p>
