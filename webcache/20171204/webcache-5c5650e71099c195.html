    <p> Geely's big strides to continue but in the price; not a substitute in sight.<br/><br/>
        In this sector report, we look to answer two key questions for 2018. The first iswhether Geely Auto can maintain
        its exceptional performance (in terms of bothsales and stock price), how it has achieved such progress, and
        whether thereis potential upside for the shares. The second is whether Great Wall Motor canrealistically be
        expected to take over the leadership baton in 2018 and how best toanticipate changes in brand performance and
        sales, using search data to supportour growth projections. We also trim estimates for BAIC Motor and Brilliance,
        andtest the assumptions behind our Buy recommendations on them.<br/><br/>
        Geely is a unique local brand leader in a crowded space.<br/><br/>
        In 10M17, Chinese local brands only reported 3% passenger vehicle (PV) salesvolume growth YoY but Geely sales
        surged 72% YoY during the period at theexpense of many once-successful local brands. We attribute Geely's
        strengthnowadays to 1) its solid technological background with enhanced quality and 2)its multiple popular
        models and diversified mix. What is more, when tracking autobrands in the Baidu and BitAuto attention indices,
        Geely has stayed within thetop since 2016. The result is market share gains, and we raise our FY17-19E
        salesvolume two-year CAGR to 22%.<br/><br/>
        Why we do not think Great Wall is a good substitute.<br/><br/>
        Great Wall is focused on the SUV segment, which is getting crowded, with everylocal/JV brand launching new
        models. Although Great Wall is also launchingnew models, the company experiences internal sales cannibalization
        and its SUVmarket is declining given a lack of brand awareness edge vs. peers. As such, wetrim our FY17-19E
        earnings by 5-6% on margin pressure, and maintain Sell as wedo not think the company can re-rate given a lack of
        sales strength.<br/><br/>
        Geely seems fully valued; BAIC and Brilliance remain our top Buys.<br/><br/>
        Given the high sales base, we expect China auto sales to grow only 4% p.a. in2018/19, with more competition,
        especially amongst local brands. As such, wetrim our forecasts for some companies under our coverage. We value
        Chineseauto OEMs mainly on a P/E basis with respect to their earnings growth. As wethink that Geely's valuation
        is already rich even considering an upbeat 2020Eoutlook, our top Buys are Brilliance China, on its new premium
        model prospects,and BAIC Motor, mainly on its recovering Hyundai JV operation. Investors couldalso consider
        pairing Geely (long) with Great Wall Motor-H (short).</p>
