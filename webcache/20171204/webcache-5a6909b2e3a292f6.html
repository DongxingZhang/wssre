    <p> Growing evidence of cyclical headwinds ¡ª We analysed the structural andcyclical headwinds the retail REITS face
        in Australian Retail Property: Sale ends ¡­not so soon? (October 20). Since that time, evidence of cyclical
        headwinds hasstrengthened, given (1) another month of soft ABS sales growth, (2) a sharpdeceleration in tenant
        sales in the REITs¡¯ September quarterlies, and (3) acontinuation of weak wage growth. Despite this, some retail
        landlords have ralliedas much as 5%, assisted by a c.20bp decline in bond yields. We see a salesrecovery as some
        way off, making a sustained re-rating of the retail REITs unlikely.<br/><br/>
        Tenant sales remain key for retail landlords ¡­ but not in the way many peoplethink ¡ª While growth in tenant
        sales, and retail rents, can diverge for periods oftime, we continue to believe these measures are closely
        linked when analysed onthe right timeframe ¨C one that mirrors the length of tenants¡¯ leases. Figure 1 showsthe
        strong relationship (correlation &gt; 0.9) between rolling five-year sales growth,and rent growth for the retail
        landlords ¨C underscoring the importance of the salesoutlook. A further 200bp slowing in retail sales growth
        could also reduce retail REITmultiples by 1 point, a c. 6-7% share price impact (Figure 19).</p>
