    <p> Happy holidays. This is what market sentiment feels like at the moment, with riskassets at or close to
        multi-year highs. Faster progress on tax reform bills in the USand the EU-UK exit deal provided the last
        positive catalysts. They add to a favourablebackdrop of strong economic growth, increasingly supportive fiscal
        and regulatorypolicy, and tightening but still easy monetary policy.<br/><br/>
        The positive environment should extend in 2018. The global economy should expandat a strong pace, with the US
        and eurozone growing above potential, and Chinaslowing down but only moderately. Political risk, though still
        present, shouldn¡¯tescalate. We expect central banks exit from ultra-accommodative monetary policy tocontinue
        very gradually. As a result we are generally constructive on risk assets.<br/><br/>
        What could challenge this positive undertone? A sharp rise in inflation for starters.<br/><br/>
        Despite strong growth and tight (or tightening) labour markets, developed marketsinflation remains low, and
        markets have gotten used to this. There are howeverincreasing signs that inflation will continue rising in 2018.
        A faster than expected pickupcould surprise markets and lead to a sharp repricing of central bank rate
        riseexpectations, which could be disruptive for risk assets ¨C akin to 2013¡¯s taper tantrum.<br/><br/>
        Another risk is China growth. Authorities seem to have gotten more comfortable withslightly slower growth, and
        the central bank is tightening monetary policy. We expectsome policy easing in mid-2018 to support growth. But
        this option may be off thetable if inflation is high. Growth would then slow and could weigh on global
        growth.<br/><br/>
        In our base case these risks don¡¯t materialise. But they are there. Happy holidays.</p>
