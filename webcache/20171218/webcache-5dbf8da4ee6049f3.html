    <p> Solid output growth in Nov-17. InNovember, the on-grid volume of LYP¡¯s wind power in China recorded a 20.0% YoY
        increase (vs. +10.4% YoY in Sep-16). Similarly, HNR recorded a 25.4% YoY increase (vs. -4.4% YoY in Sep-16). For
        the 11M17, the on-grid volume growth of wind power in China picked up to 14.5% YoY (LYP) and 14.7% (HNR) from
        13.8% YoY (LYP) and 13.3% (HNR)for the 10M17. We think this is mainly due to the resumptionin both the wind
        speed and the power consumption in Northern and Northeast China in November.<br/><br/>
        LYP registered stronggrowth in Northern and Northeast China, which accounted for c.37% and c.17% of its
        Novemberwind power output, up 26.0% and 46.8% YoY, respectively.Growth inNorthernChina was in particular
        substantial compared toa 10.5% YoY decrease in October. Meanwhile, the on-grid volume growth inSouthern China
        recorded an 8.7% YoY decrease from a 19.6% YoY increase in October. According to LYP¡¯s management,the overall
        curtailment rate has dropped by 4.0ppt YoY to 7.0%(vs. 11.0% in Nov-16).We see the curtailment rate came up by
        1.1ppt from 5.9% in Oct-17, which we think it is mainly attributed to the seasonality. It is also worth of
        noting that a 244.5MW wind farm in South Africa started the commercial operation this month as scheduled. HNRsaw
        steadygrowth in Northern, Northeast and Southern China,which accounted for c.45%, c.17% and c. 25% of its
        November wind power output, up 26.1%, 41.2% and 24.3% YoY, respectively.In contrast to LYP, HNR recorded a very
        solid increase in Southern China, thanks to the strong recovery in Yunnanafter the completion of local
        substation upgrading project. According to HNR¡¯s management, the overall curtailment ratehasdropped 5.0ppt YoY
        to c.6.0% (vs. c.11.0% in Oct-16).<br/><br/>
        ARs to remain a drag on sector recovery. We see the sector bottomed up by c.5% on the back of the strong
        operation datasince last week but now seems lost the growing engine. In our view, the increase in the ARs
        remains a big concern for investors preventing the whole sector from any fast bottom up unless a feasible method
        of solving the shortage in the renewable energy fund were announced by the government.We maintain our BUY rating
        on LYP and HNR for the time being.</p>
