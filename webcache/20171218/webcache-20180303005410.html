    <p> Turkey¡¯s Q3 GDP growth of 11.1% y/y was well above the Bloomberg market consensus of8.5%, but close to our call
        of 11.0%.<br/><br/>
        We estimate that 7pp of the 11.1% growth related to domestic expenditure and 3.6pp tocapital formation.
        Machinery investments rose by 15.3% y/y in Q3, the highest in two years.<br/><br/>
        Leading indicators suggest economic activity is set to slow down, and we expect the annualgrowth rate to ease
        towards 4.0% in 2018, from 6.5% this year.</p>
