    <p> Terminator 2: Judgment Day starts monetization in US<br/><br/>
        On December 6th, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (T2) has started monetization inUS along with latest content update.
        Players can now open regular supply cratefor 1000virtual coins, equivalent to US$1.15. Players are rewarded
        in-game avatarskins. According to Appannie, iOS gross revenue ranking was at #229on 6th anddropped to #239the
        next day. We discuss possible monetization metrics below,but would emphasize that we think both the game and
        monetization feel verymuch in beta testing mode and subject to material evolution over time.<br/><br/>
        Wilderness Action monetization forthcoming<br/><br/>
        Compared with T2, Wilderness Action (WA) has yet to test monetization. We haveseen from recent version updates
        that WA has introduced a broader range of skinsfor characters and weapons than T2. General players can earn
        coins and spend onordinary skins within a reasonable amount of play time, so revenue contributionfrom those item
        sales are not likely to be huge.<br/><br/>
        Monetization reference for Honor of Kings<br/><br/>
        We think Honor of Kings (HoK) serves as a good proxy for WA due to their Playto-Win nature. According to Penguin
        Intelligence, HoK player consumptions aremainly motivated by obtaining new champions and skins, while only 30%
        payingusers choose runes (an item to strengthen champions) as main purchasing choice.Giving a 30% haircut in
        HoK¡¯s ARPU, theoretical WA¡¯s ARPU could be ~RMB8per month. NetEase announced 100m total registered users on
        December 5th;<br/><br/>
        assuming similar 7-day retention rate of HoK of 20%, we could see WA¡¯s MAU at20m and thereby could lead to a
        gross billing of RMB160m per month.<br/><br/>
        WA progression since launch<br/><br/>
        WA has been releasing frequent updates since its launch on Nov 3rd. Variousnew features have been added to the
        game including weather system, newweapons, vehicle patrol consumption and skins. The latest update
        introduced¡°Quins¡± which allow 5players to play as a team against 19other teams. Accordingto AppAnnie, Knives Out
        (oversea version of WA) iOS download ranking hasreached #100in 68countries and #10in 12countries including US
        and Japan.</p>
