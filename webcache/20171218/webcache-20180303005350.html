    <p> Macau gaming stocks surged yesterday on expectations that December is going to be a strong month. We believe
        that stock picking is still the key, and as we notedpreviously, MGM China will benefit,given the opening of MGM
        Cotai next month and a significant performance lag earlier this year. Trading at 14x EV/EBITDA, its valuation is
        still reasonable. Galaxy Entertainment, at 15x EV/EBITDA, should also benefit as it remains the most balanced
        casino operator with new capacity coming onstream after 2019.</p>
