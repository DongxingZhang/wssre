    <p> First monthly sales over 100k as Chinese EV sales lift towards the end of year<br/><br/>
        Chinese EV sales data has been released, with 119k vehicles sold in November(102k full electric, 17k plug-in
        hybrid), setting a monthly record and taking YTDsales to 624k vs. 407k this time last year. We forecast
        2017Chinese EV sales of740k vehicles, so momentum will need to be maintained going into December;<br/><br/>
        however, this is historically a strong month. This supports our 2017global demandforecast of 279kt LCE (+31%
        YoY) and for the market to remain tight into the newyear. Looking to next year we forecast Chinese EV sales of
        1,050k, (450k full EV,360k PHEV, 240k commercial) and a global lithium demand of 342kt LCE.<br/><br/>
        Carbonate prices maintain YTD gains moving into the low season<br/><br/>
        Since the start of the year, China battery-grade carbonate has risen 35% toUS$25,850/t, while hydroxide has
        fallen 5% to US$23,200/t. The spodumenemarket should move into a broad surplus in 2018, but conversion capacity
        will lagfeedstock, restricting finished product supply. Suppliers throughout the batterychain have built stocks
        moving into the low season, so we expect pricing to bereflective of real demand over the next few months. New
        conversion capacity iscoming, however much of it is longer dated. On robust demand and constrainedsupply, we
        forecast rising pricing into 1H18, with pricing easing later in 2H18.</p>
