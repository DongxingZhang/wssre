    <p> Positive Outlook for China Property Management Sector in 2018. We maintain our optimistic view of the China
        Property Management sector, even though the property market in China continues to face tightening. In 2018, we
        continue to expect leading property management companies to be able to secure steady growth in their GFA under
        management as China continues to urbanize. Official data suggests that GFA completed in Jan-Oct 2017 was stable
        compared to previous years, and this should support the fundamental business of property management
        companies.<br/><br/>
        Investment Highlights Intact for Both the Macro and Micro Side. We believe there are four investment theses for
        the sector in 2018. (i) From the top-down angle, the continuous addition of completed GFA in China will be the
        backbone for property managers¡¯ expansion in their core business. (ii) The property management sector has
        relatively lower risk than property developers, as we continue to see policy tightening in 2018.<br/><br/>
        On the micro-side, (iii) we see the leading companies stepping up their efforts in M&amp;A;, and some major
        transactions are likely to start contributing in 2018, such as COPL¡¯s acquisition of CITIC Property Management.
        (iv) The booming demand for value-added services offers robust growth opportunities for certain property
        management companies as they expand into more services.<br/><br/>
        Industry Consolidation Will Continue Amid More Capital Market Activities. The property market in China has
        witnessed rapid consolidation in recent years, particularly after the government imposed various restrictions.
        We believe leading property managers could benefit as well, as they have good relationships with the leading
        developers. The listed property management companies will also likely to be industry consolidators, as they have
        access to cheaper capital. We believe Hong Kong will continue to be the preferred place for property management
        companies to get listed, and market sentiment will get better as more capital market activities are likely to
        take place in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Three Companies under Coverage Should Continue To Thrive in 2018. We expect the three companies, all with a BUY
        rating, to deliver solid earnings growth for 2017E and 2018E. Our top pick is Greentown Service because of its
        clear and solid earnings growth.<br/><br/>
        Greentown Service: We expect ~30% GFA growth p.a. Its new value-added services should help it achieve 40% EPS
        growth in 2018E. Our TP of HK$6.70 is based on 30x 2018E PER.<br/><br/>
        COPL: We expect the CITIC asset injection to help the Company achieve ~36% EPS growth in 2018E. Our TP of
        HK$2.35 is based on 20x 2018E PER.<br/><br/>
        Colour Life,: Even without considering the acquisition of Wanda Property Management¡¯s assets, we still expect it
        to achieve earnings recovery in 2018E, with further potential upside.</p>
