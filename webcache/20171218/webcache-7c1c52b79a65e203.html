    <p> Decent earnings growth and attractive yield; we prefer Cinda over Huarong.<br/><br/>
        We think current macro/policy cycles still favor AMCs¡¯ earnings and we remainconstructive on AMCs¡¯ longer-term
        growth, given abundant distressed assetsupply. We expect Cinda and Huarong to deliver mid- to high-teen
        earningsgrowth with 6-7% dividend yields. In this outlook report, we discuss 1) keytrends for AMC business
        lines; 2) distressed assets supply and demand; 3) theimpact of the PBOC¡¯s new asset management guidance; and 4)
        capital andIFRS 9 impact. Cinda remains our sector top pick with higher-quality earningsand less shadow banking
        exposure. The stock trades at 0.67x 2018E P/B and4.8x P/E. We suggest investors accumulate Cinda before March
        2018 results.<br/><br/>
        Key trends in distressed asset management.<br/><br/>
        We think the traditional NPL acquisition &amp; disposal (TDA) and debt-to-equityswap (DES) business will
        continue to benefit from elevated asset prices. Aneutral/tightening-biased monetary policy should also drive
        stable restructuringdistressed asset (RDA) earnings growth. On the margin side, TDA disposalreturn has been
        rising and RDA may finally see yield recovery in 2018 ¨C as wesaw for trust product yield. On the new round of
        market-driven DES, AMCs arenot as active as banks and we think AMCs may set up DES funds rather thanuse their
        own capital to invest. Also, IFRS 9, which starts in 2018, maypotentially provide one-time revaluation gains for
        unlisted DES assets, leadingto large capital boosts (2.4-4.7% CET-1 boost for Cinda, per our
        estimate).<br/><br/>
        Distressed assets supply and demand dynamics.<br/><br/>
        We think supply and demand dynamics for distressed assets in China are likelyto maintain a tight balance as new
        NPL supply should be absorbed quickly byvarious distressed asset players. We forecast a 15% CAGR in distressed
        assetsupply to Rmb1.9tr in 2019E, with more supply from shadow banking andcorporate instead of traditional banks
        (i.e., more RDA acquisition opportunities).<br/><br/>
        On the demand side, there are now 56 local AMCs with total registered capitalof Rmb118bn (&gt;Cinda¡¯s TDA
        balance), and many distressed funds have beenactive in the secondary market, which should benefit AMCs¡¯ NPL
        disposal.<br/><br/>
        Impact of PBOC¡¯s new asset management rules.<br/><br/>
        As asset management is an essential part of the shadow banking system inChina, the new rules are likely to
        squeeze shadow banking liquidity andincrease asset quality pressure. This creates distressed asset
        businessopportunities, but may also affect AMCs¡¯ own shadow banking businesses,especially the on-balance sheet
        non-standardized credit assets (NSCA)investment. We think Huarong may be more impacted, given its large
        NSCAexposure (28% of group assets vs. 6% for Cinda).<br/><br/>
        Sector top pick ¨C Cinda (raising target price to HK$3.75); valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        Our sector top pick is Cinda. We see upside earnings potential, with 1) largerTDA assets to benefit from rising
        NPL prices; 2) larger (unlisted) DES portfolioto benefit from elevated commodity prices and IFRS 9; and 3) a
        turnaroundstory in life and bank subsidiaries. We lift our target prices for Cinda (+7%) andHuarong (+12%) by
        rolling over to 2018E. We adopt a sum-of-the-parts (SoTP)valuation methodology. Key sector risks include
        property prices, investmentloss, and weaker-than-expected distressed asset supply (see page 18).</p>
