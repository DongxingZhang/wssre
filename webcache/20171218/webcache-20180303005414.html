    <p> Pfizer¡¯s Lipitor stayed as top-selling drugs in Fujian procurement.<br/><br/>
        Recently, Fujian¡¯s controlled procurement website for drugs (¸£½¨Ê¡Ò©Æ·ÁªºÏÏÞ¼ÛÑô¹â²É¹ºÍøÒ©Æ·) published its top 20 best selling
        medicines by hospital salesvalue from Sept to Nov 2017. We believe that Fujian¡¯s current drug tender
        biddingshave already referenced to (1) the grouping of drug type and format; (2) reducedgovernment reimbursement
        amount; and (3) ¡°Two Invoice System¡± for distributors.<br/><br/>
        We do not aware too big of the drug price cut on the existing list. Its #1 best sellingdrug has been to Pfizer¡¯s
        Lipitor Á¢ÆÕÍ× (Atorvastatin) for three consecutivemonths, which is a well-known statin based cholesterol-lowering
        medicine. In 2017,Lipitor¡¯s tender price in Jiangsu province for 40mg pack stands at RMB15.6, about38% premium
        to two packs of 20mg tablet format of the same ingredient fromBeijing Jialin Pharma (±±¾©¼ÎÁÖÒ©Òµ) of Ah Le (°¢ÀÖ)
        (RMB5.6/20mg).<br/><br/>
        Pfizer¡¯s antibiotics ranked at least top #3.<br/><br/>
        Note that, in 2016, Fujian provincial drug sales of RMB34.5bn made up 1.9% f thecountry¡¯s total, which was
        ranked #18 in China. Sales of another medicine fromPfizer called Cefoperazone Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium for
        Injection (×¢ÉäÓÃÍ·æßßßÍªÄÆÊæ°ÍÌ¹ÄÆ) was also ranked either top #2 and #3 position during theperiod. It is a mix of
        cephalosporin and beta-lactam based antibiotics. The tenderprice of this antibiotics in Guizhou at RMB67.2/ 1.5g
        is as much as 593% premiumto that of CSPC¡¯s (1093.HK, NR) generic version of the same format, whosepackage
        contains 3.0g of the drug content at RMB19.4 each in Jiangsu Province.<br/><br/>
        Key drugs from CSPC, Luye and Sinobiopharm in Fujian league table.<br/><br/>
        Only three HK listed drug-makers¡¯ medicines could hit the top 20 position in thisFujian procurement, namely (1)
        CSPC¡¯s NBP ¶÷±ØÆÕ (Butylphthalide Soft Capsule¶¡±½ÌªÈí½ºÄÒ); (2) Luye Pharm¡¯s (2186.HK, BUY, TP:HKD5.40) Beixi
        ±´Ï£(Acarbose soft capsule °¢¿¨²¨ÌÇ½ºÄÒ); and (3) Sinobiopharm¡¯s (1177.HK, NR)Kaifen ¿­·×(Flurbiprofen Axetil Injection
        ·ú±ÈÂå·Òõ¥×¢ÉäÒº). NBP, a heart &amp;brain; medicine (to treat acute ischemic stroke) from CSPC, had over 38% and
        33%y-o-y sales growth in 2016 and 9M17 respectively, at HKD2.7bn and HKD2.6bn.<br/><br/>
        NBP sales made up 21%-23%/55% of CSPC¡¯s total revenue and total innovativedrug sales respectively during both
        2016 and 9M17.<br/><br/>
        Luye¡¯s Beixi sales heading to 41%/30% y-o-y in FY17F-18F.<br/><br/>
        On our forecast, Luye¡¯s Beixi as a diabetic cure, which will make up 20%/22% ofFY17F-18F Luye¡¯s revenue, is seen
        to jump 41%/30% y-o-y in this and next year(FY16: 30%). Beixi stunning sales growth has been exemplified in 1H17
        at 41% y-o-y.<br/><br/>
        On the other hand, Kaifen injections from Sinobiopharm as an anti-inflammatoryand analgesic medicine in
        respiratory area, had already booked 24%/17% y-o-ysales growth in FY15-16. Moreover, as we flagged in our 23
        November 2017 report,Fujian province had sent out a consultation paper, that it will join hands withShanghai,
        Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhenjiang provinces for centralized and vastprocurement of medicines on multi-provincial
        basis. We see this may led to lowerdrug tender prices than the usual level.</p>
