    <p> Following our short term BEER approach to assess FX nominal fair value in LatinAmerica, COP is now the currency
        with the biggest divergence with model values.<br/><br/>
        COP has lagged several historical underlying factors like terms of trade (basicallycrude oil price) and credit
        risk (proxied by CDS). Unless there is a structural break(not our scenario) a catch up should be a matter of
        when and not if.<br/><br/>
        Strategy: Extend and increase the short USDCOP position: close short USDCOPposition at 3,032; notional USD 8mn;
        maturity 29 December 2017; open a new shortUSDCOP position at 3,047; Allocation: USD 12mn; Maturity: 14 March
        2018; initialtarget: 2,850; initial stop-loss: 3,200.</p>
