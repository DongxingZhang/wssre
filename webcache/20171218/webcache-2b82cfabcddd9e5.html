    <p> The KRX construction index trades at 0.7x forward P/B and 7x P/E, which representrespective discounts of 38% and
        24% to the Kospi¡¯s current figures of 1.1x and 9.2xand the steepest seen since 2004. With such figures also
        comparable to levelsseen when the sector struggled with balance-sheet or systemic risks. The sector islargely
        free of such risks, however, and now mainly faces regulatory hurdles, so weforesee limited downside for
        construction shares.<br/><br/>
        Oil and asset prices are both poised for further growth in 2018, with the pace ofhikes to dictate how positive
        they are for sector shares, but we expect them toreach Goldilocks, since: 1) EPC projects still face
        difficulties securing financing;and 2) the Korean government is striving to rein in housing prices.<br/><br/>
        We upgrade our sector rating to OVERWEIGHT in anticipation of a positiveperformance for construction shares in
        2018, with our top picks, in descendingorder, remaining: 1) Hyundai Development Co¡ªon expectations of its
        transitioninto a holding company structure unlocking hidden value; 2) GS E&amp;C;¡ªon itsattractiveness from
        momentum in the domestic reconstruction/redevelopmentmarket, with it also poised to turn profitable overseas;
        and 3) Hyundai E&amp;C;¡ªwith itset to enjoy balanced growth at home and abroad next year.<br/><br/>
        Sector¡¯s relative performance at post-2004 low amid regulatory risk: TheKRX construction index trades at
        respective discounts of 38% and 24% to the Kospi interms of P/B and P/E. Sector performance vis-¨¤-vis the Kospi
        is now worse than that seenduring the 2008 global financial crisis, which is when it struggled with
        balance-sheet risk,including unsold inventory and PF guarantees. Sector levels are also near those seen
        over2003-2005 in the wake of the credit card bubble, which was marked by systemic risk andtighter real estate
        regulations during the Roh Moo-Hyun administration. We foreseelimited downside for sector shares, however, as
        recent corrections owe mainly toregulatory risk, with there being no significant balance-sheet or systemic risk
        at present.<br/><br/>
        Oil- and asset-price hikes to help sector shares enjoy Goldilocks: Rising pricesfor oil and assets could lift
        sector shares, which largely lack new growth opportunities andare being weighed down by real estate regulations.
        Gradual upward revisions to long-termoil price forecasts (vs near-term price fluctuations) ought to improve
        financing conditionsfor overseas EPC projects, and with the Korean government determined to cool the realestate
        market, spikes in domestic housing prices (as asset prices rally world) could invitemore regulations and thus
        keep sector shares range bound. Additional regulations areunlikely, however, after myriad loan and tax rules
        were tightened this year, while aGoldilocks housing market would almost certainly help stocks break out and
        trend up.<br/><br/>
        Three key issues for 2018: Concerns are rising that the housing market in 2018 willbe weighed on by: 1) tighter
        lending regulations; 2) interest rate hikes; and 3) move-involume growth. Indeed, regulation tightening over the
        past year has been a significantdrag on new borrowers in the housing market, but rate hikes and increased
        move-involume appear unlikely to have much impact on ongoing asset price hikes, despite beingsimilar to historic
        instances.</p>
