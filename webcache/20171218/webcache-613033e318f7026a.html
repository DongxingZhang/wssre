    <p> We attended NetEase's (NTES) annual December game pipeline event onDecember 17 in Shanghai. The session lasted
        for three hours. Compared tolast year, this year's event focused more on a media experience, presentingshowcases
        and cinematic trailer of upcoming games instead of providingdemonstration of new games or gameplay footages. The
        following are keyobservations from the event: 1) Of the 18 pipeline games (see Figure 1 below),only 8 were new
        titles and 3 of them are self-developed. Most of the games in thepipeline were ones we were aware of (or have
        already been released). 2) Sandboxshooting genre and Chu Liuxiang, a self-developed MMORPG, appears to be
        themain title of focus for 1Q18. Chu Liuxiang is scheduled for soft launch in February.<br/><br/>
        3) NTES continues to be focused on a pan-media experience with existing IPs,announcing a TV series for Fantasy
        Westward Journey jointly produced withChina Entertainment. Musical, TV animation and movie for Onmyoji appear to
        beon their way as well.<br/><br/>
        In our experience, companies tend to showcase cinematic than gameplay whengames are in their earlier stage of
        game development and not yet available forcommercial release. In fact, many of the timetable for games announced
        onSunday were for close-beta testing (CBT), which suggests a handful of them mayrelease in 2Q18 rather than in
        1Q18. Absence of active promotion of Tribes andEmpire also suggests the game may not be high of a strategic
        focus for thefirm. Given NTES' strong R&amp;D; capabilities, we would have liked to see glimpsesof innovation
        into new gameplay/genre beyond the R&amp;D; focus on MOBA andSandbox shooting genre that we had already known
        has been in the works formore than half a year.<br/><br/>
        Stockwise, we believe existing themes such as monetization of Rules of Survivors/T2/Minecraft, which we think is
        largely being priced into the stock, will remainthe key drivers of share price until the release of Chu
        Liuxiang.</p>
