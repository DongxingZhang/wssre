    <p> Last Friday, the HKSFC released the aggregate short positions data for December 1. Weanalysed which companies
        may be vulnerable to short-selling activity, based on the followingthree criteria: (i) the net change in short
        positions between November 24 and December1; (ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the
        absolute amount of short positions.<br/><br/>
        We must emphasize this is only an objective quantitative analysis based onofficial data; the analysis does NOT
        imply that we feel uncomfortable with the corporategovernance or fundamentals of some companies. We have seen
        more active shortsellingactivity as the market has been getting more volatile. According to the results of
        ouranalysis, we believe CR Pharmaceutical (3320.HK), Sunny Optical (2382.HK), Agile(3383.HK), Country Garden
        (2007.HK), CMOC (3993.HK) and Q Tech (1478.HK) requireclose monitoring, based on their latest short positions
        outstanding. On the other hand, wenote that short positions in China Coal (1898.HK), China Power (2380.HK) and
        China Longyuan(0916.HK) have dropped significantly.<br/><br/>
        Short positions in CR Pharmaceutical, Sunny Optical, Agile, Country Garden, CMOCand Q Tech increased
        significantly. As Figure 2 shows, short positions in CR Pharmaceutical,Sunny Optical, Agile, Country Garden,
        CMOC and Q Tech rose 11.9x, 66%, 39%,34%, 34% and 29%, respectively, during the week ended December 1. The
        outstandingshort positions were equivalent to 4.6%, 5.5%, 7.8%, 6.4%, 10.9% and 4.6%, respectively,of their free
        float. In general, most of these stocks have recorded strong performance YTD,so they may be targets for
        profit-taking, particularly Sunny Optical, Q Tech, Agile, CountryGarden and CMOC. Although we have not noticed
        major negative news flow related to CRPharmaceutical, its share price has been weak since early
        December.<br/><br/>
        Significant decline in short positions in China Coal, China Power and China Longyuan.<br/><br/>
        Outstanding short positions in China Coal, China Power and China Longyuandropped 63%, 27% and 25%, respectively,
        during the week ended December 1 (Figure 3).<br/><br/>
        These stocks have been under pressure since October. China Longyuan, in particular, hasalready dropped &gt;17%
        from its peak in October. The sharp decline in short positions maysuggest the selling pressure may near the end.<br/><br/>
        Recap: Source of data. The HKSFC releases the aggregate short positions in all eligiblestocks every Friday with
        a delay of one week. The HKEx releases the data on short-sellingactivity on a daily basis (without a one-week
        delay), but investors do not know whether theshort positions are covered or not later. Therefore, the usefulness
        of the HKSFC data is thatit provides the outstanding short positions in each stock, and investors can trace the
        netchange on a weekly basis. However, there are still some limitations, as this data set cannotcover
        short-selling activity using OTC derivative products.<br/><br/>
        Three angles to analyzing the data. (i) The net change in short positions between November24 and December 1;
        (ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the absoluteamount of the short positions.</p>
