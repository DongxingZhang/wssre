    <p> Rental property registration incentives announced: Government officials onDec 13 revealed part #2 of a housing
        welfare roadmap, which details plans to encouragethe registration of rental properties. Such moves aim to
        address the housing insecurity oftenants living in private rental properties, many of whom struggle with steep
        rent hikes orbeing compelled to move frequently. Even though the government has steadily increasedsupplies of
        public rental properties, 70% of renters nationwide still live in dwellings let byprivate landlords. The latest
        measures reward voluntary registration of rental property,but this could be made mandatory in phases from 2020,
        depending on market conditions.<br/><br/>
        Owner benefits: To achieve its goal, the government has come up with the followingincentives to encourage owners
        of multiple dwellings to register as rental operators.<br/><br/>
        Capital gains tax: Dwellings registered as quasi-public rental housings and let for atleast eight years will,
        from 2019, be entitled to tax breaks of 70% on capital gains (vs50% currently) for long-time home
        ownership.<br/><br/>
        Acquisition and property taxes: Registered rental housing will be chargedreduced or no acquisition and property
        taxes until 2021 (these benefits were originallyset to last through 2018).<br/><br/>
        Health insurance premium: While rental income earners are obliged to pay healthinsurance premiums starting in
        2019, rental operators earning KRW20m or less inannual rental income and letting properties for 4 years will be
        exempted from paying40% of insurance premium hikes (or 80% if letting for 8 years).<br/><br/>
        Rental income tax: Annual rental income of KRW20m or less will be taxedseparately at a flat rate from 2019, but
        registered rental operators can deduct 70% ofrental income as necessary expenses (vs 60% if unregistered), so
        those with annualrental income of less than KRW13.33m will not be taxed from 2019 (vs KRW10mcurrently). These
        benefits will apply to rental operators that register at least onedwelling as a rental property (vs three
        currently).</p>
