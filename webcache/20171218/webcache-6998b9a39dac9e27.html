    <p> Summary. The CGS A-share research team expects the coal-electricity price linkage mechanism to be activated in
        early 2018, basedon coal prices between November 2016 and October 2017. We estimate that the national average
        on-grid tariff for coal-fired powerplants will be raised by RMB0.0119/kwh. The potential annualized earnings
        accretion for Huadian Power (1071.HK), Huaneng Power(0902.HK) and Datang Power (0991.HK) will be RMB315m,
        RMB555m and RMB264m, respectively, equivalent to 320%, 17% and10% of their 2017E net profit. Huadian Power is
        the preferred pick of our A-share team, given its high exposure to coal-fired powerplants (&gt;80%) and
        potential asset injection from its parent company once the profitability of coal-fired power plants
        improves.<br/><br/>
        Poor profitability of coal-fired IPPs in 9M2017. According to our A-share research team, 29 listed coal-fired
        IPPs (including both Ashareand H-share companies) recorded a 69.8% YoY decline in recurring net profit in
        9M2019, with a net margin of merely 3.2%.<br/><br/>
        Both figures are very low compared with the historical range. About two-thirds of coal-fired IPPs (including
        non-listed companies) areestimated to have recorded losses in 9M2017. In particular, nearly 90% of coal-fired
        IPPs in Shanxi were loss-making.<br/><br/>
        Coal prices expected to remain firm in the near term. Coal prices have gone up significantly since 2H2016. The
        NDRC launchedsome policy measures this year to moderate coal prices. Although there has been a moderate decline
        in coal prices recently, p ricesare expected to remain firm in the near term thanks to strong heating demand
        during the winter season.</p>
