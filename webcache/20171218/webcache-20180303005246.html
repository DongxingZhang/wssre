    <p> Industrial production: IP growth slowed in October partly on account offestival-related holidays. The monthly
        data tends to be volatile, and thereforewe prefer to look at the three month trailing trend, which has been on
        animproving path over the last 3 months.<br/><br/>
        Export growth: Export growth accelerated to 30.5%YoY in Nov-17 after acontraction last month. While higher
        commodity prices have helped, noncommodityexport growth rose to the highest in 7 months.<br/><br/>
        Non-oil non-gold imports: Non-oil non-gold import growth (as a proxy fordomestic demand) accelerated to a 6
        month high of 22.6% in Nov-17, withcapital goods imports turning positive after 2 months of
        contraction.<br/><br/>
        Rabi sowing area: Area under cultivation for winter crop (Rabi) picked uppace, growing by 1%YoY for week ended
        Dec 15th. Area under cultivation forwheat, which is main the Rabi crop, saw a decline of 2%YoY, while areaunder
        pulses rose by 9%.<br/><br/>
        CPI: November CPI inflation accelerated to a 15-month high of 4.88%YoY.<br/><br/>
        Inflation was expected to edge higher on the back of vegetable price spike,however the upside surprise was
        driven by a faster momentum in coreinflation, which rose to 5% in Nov.<br/><br/>
        WPI: November WPI inflation accelerated to a 7-month high of 3.9%YoY vs.<br/><br/>
        3.6% in Oct. The rise was driven by higher food inflation (driven by vegetableseggs). Inflation in the non-food
        non-fuel segment also rose.<br/><br/>
        Trade deficit: Trade deficit was largely steady at US$13.8bn (8.4% of GDPannualised) in Nov vs. US$14bn(8.6% of
        GDP annualised) in Oct.<br/><br/>
        Current account deficit: Current account deficit narrowed to US$ 7.2bn inQE Sep-17 (1.2% of GDP) from US$ 15bn
        (2.5% of GDP) in QE Jun, helpedby a lower trade deficit and higher services exports &amp; transfers.<br/><br/>
        Gradual recovery keeping macro stability in check: We expect the growthrecovery to gradually gather pace, and
        expect GDP growth at 7.2% in FY19efrom 6.7% in FY18e. We expect consumption, public capex and exports to bethe
        main drivers even as private capex remains in repair mode. Inflation isexpected to edge higher until Jun-18 (to
        ~5-5.5%) partly due to a low base.<br/><br/>
        We expect the RBI to keep rates on hold, while incrementally sound morehawkish given the upside in near-term
        inflation trajectory. We believe that agradual growth recovery should keep inflation drivers in check,
        justifying apause in rates.</p>
