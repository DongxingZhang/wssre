    <p> Commentary for Monday: With last week¡¯s jobs report in hand, the Fed isscheduled to meet on Tuesday and
        Wednesday for their final 2017 meeting.<br/><br/>
        Wednesday afternoon, the FOMC will likely announce a rate hike along withthe release of the latest Summary of
        Economic Projections (SEP), followed byChair Yellen's final post-FOMC press conference. Despite recent strong
        inflationprints, we believe it is too early for the median "dot" to change from September'sSEP. However, there
        may be some upward migration of individual dots reflectingrecent strength in inflation as well as revisions to
        growth and unemploymentforecasts to take into account recent economic performance. In Chair Yellen'spress
        conference, we expect her to field questions on the inflation outlook, thetax reform bill, and the change in Fed
        leadership. Towards the first point, hermessage on inflation will likely be close to the Fed's recent rhetoric
        that transitoryfactors are the most important source of recent inflation misses. In regards to taxreform, she
        will likely not comment other than to reiterate that the Fed will takeinto account the implications of the tax
        reform bill on economic activity when itsets monetary policy. See our recent Fed Note for more detail.<br/><br/>
        Going in to the FOMC meeting, there will be a few important data points that theFed will likely also be
        watching. Though Monday's JOLTS data will be a bit staleas it refers to October, the hiring and quits rates are
        favorite indicators for ChairYellen. A higher priority for the Fed, however, is Tuesday's PPI and
        Wednesday'sCPI, which on the margin may influence the tone of inflation language in theFOMC statement. We expect
        slight moderations in PPI given last month¡¯s strongprints in both headline (0.3% m-o-m vs. 0.4%) and core (0.2%
        m-o-m vs. 0.4%). Ofnote for us is the healthcare services component of the PPI, which is an input intothe
        corresponding series in the core PCE deflator - the Fed¡¯s preferred inflationmetric. Recall that healthcare has
        the largest weighting in the core PCE. Ourview is that the inflation trends are beginning to firm and should
        continue inWednesday's CPI for both headline (0.4% m-o-m vs. 0.1% previously) as wellas core (0.2% m-o-m vs.
        0.2%). Prints in line with our forecast would boost thesix-month annualized change in core CPI about 25 basis
        points over October¡¯snumber of 1.8%, which would provide further evidence of firming inflation.<br/><br/>
        Post the FOMC meeting, we receive retail sales and inventories on Thursday.<br/><br/>
        With regard to the former, we expect total retail sales (0.3% m-o-m vs. 0.2%)to remain roughly steady. Auto
        sales will likely remain a drag in the near future partially due to high gas prices as well as hurricane-related
        replacement pullingdemand into previous months. Because of this, we see ex autos (0.6% m-o-mvs. 0.1%) coming in
        stronger than overall retail sales. We see another strongprint in retail control as well, growing at about 0.4%
        month-on-month, which isconsistent with our 2.5% Q4 PCE forecast. Given some previous post-hurricanerelated
        drawdown in business inventories (0.2% m-o-m vs. -0.1%), particularly inretail motor vehicles, we expect some
        bounceback as manufacturers and retailersrestore their inventories to normal levels. On the margin, this could
        affect our Q4GDP forecast, which is currently at 2.8%.<br/><br/>
        Friday¡¯s data is all about manufacturing which should show continued solidmomentum. Industrial production (0.4%
        m-o-m vs. 0.9%) will likely moderateslightly after last month¡¯s strong print, though it should get a bit of a
        boostfrom aggregate hours worked in manufacturing and mining and logging. Capacityutilization (77.4 vs. 77.0)
        should tick up a bit as it continues its recovery from themid-2014 oil price collapse. As with industrial
        production, the New York Fed¡¯sEmpire survey (+17.5 vs 19.4) should moderate off of recent highs, but
        remainsolidly in positive territory. Expectations for the future have been strong in thissurvey, as well as
        other regional manufacturing surveys, particularly in the neworders and capital expenditure components. All of
        these strong manufacturingdata again point toward solid, above trend growth in Q4.<br/><br/>
        As always, keep an ear out for news out of Washington. Both the House andSenate have named their representatives
        for the conference that will attempt toreconcile the two versions of the tax reform bill, and negotiations are
        proceedingwith a goal of having a final bill completed and sent to the President by Christmas.<br/><br/>
        Depending on the final contours of the bill, this remains an upside risk to our2018 growth forecasts of 2.3%
        (Q4/Q4). Also, Tuesday¡¯s special election for theAlabama Senate is worth watching, which current polls have as a
        toss-up. Whilethis will not likely impact tax reform if passed according to Republicans¡¯ idealschedule, it could
        have an impact if the bill¡¯s progress drags out into next year.<br/><br/>
        Negotiations regarding government funding are also proceeding apace, with atwo-week continuing resolution
        passing last Thursday, keeping the lights on untilDecember 22nd. This is intended to give lawmakers time to put
        together a longerterm budget deal, but there is a chance this turns messy with some politicianson both sides
        spoiling for a fight. We ultimately view a protracted governmentshutdown as unlikely, but it is still a risk
        worth flagging.</p>
