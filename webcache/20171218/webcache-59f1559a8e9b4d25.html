    <p> Chile¡¯s central bank left the policy rate unchanged at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday,at 2.5%. The
        decision was widely expected and was in line with our forecast. Starting 2018, thenumber of policy meetings will
        be reduced to eight (from the current 12).<br/><br/>
        Importantly, the statement highlighted that the data unveiled since the December MonetaryPolicy Report (IPoM)
        was published stood in line with the BCCh¡¯s base case scenario. Thatscenario also expected the policy rate to
        stay unchanged near term.<br/><br/>
        The central bank also highlighted that risks of a slower convergence of inflation to the targetpersist due to
        the low prevailing rate of inflation and made it clear that it would be ready to act ifthose risks were to
        materialise.<br/><br/>
        We expect inflation to climb gradually and thus do not think that the risks mentioned by themonetary authority
        will materialise. We expect the policy rate to remain unchanged until late Q22018. By then, growth would have
        accelerated further and the output gap would start to close.<br/><br/>
        We expect the central bank to start a gradual, rate normalisation cycle around mid-2018.<br/><br/>
        On the external front, BCCh characterised global financial conditions as little changed. nOn thedomestic front,
        the central bank highlighted the modest decline in core inflation to 1.8% y/y andthe fact that inflation
        expectations had not changed much. Labor market performance is stillseen as weak.</p>
