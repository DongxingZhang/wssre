    <p> With the US tax reform making headway, US equity funds posted inflows for thefourth consecutive week which,
        after all, is the longest inflows streak since theend of Q1. In Europe meanwhile, political uncertainties in the
        UK and, to a lesserextent, Germany, seem to weigh as European equity funds posted outflows forthe fourth time in
        six weeks. This comes despite Euro area PMIs reaching a freshsix-year high, and we think this has partly to do
        with investors' diminished beliefin ever stronger PMIs, which are already consistent with GDP growth well
        abovetrend and forecasts. Momentum for US domiciled money into Europe, which hadbeen a key driver of European
        inflows over the summer, has also slowed in favourof US onshore investments and should turn negative over the
        coming monthsgiven our macro surprise forecasts (see Fig. 1).<br/><br/>
        Going into this central bank packed week, bond fund investors showed caution,with flows into bond mandates
        hovering near the lowest this year. And with theholiday season closing in, investors are also disengaging
        elsewhere, pushing our'money at work' indicator close to year-to-date lows (see Fig. 4). We don't findevidence
        of typical year-end rallies in fund flows and, barring major surprises outof the Fed¡¯s meeting on Wednesday and
        the ECB and BoE policy meetings onThursday, a quiet few weeks should be ahead.</p>
