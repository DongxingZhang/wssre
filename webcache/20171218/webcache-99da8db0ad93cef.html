    <p> We looked at the recent Southbound Stock Connect data. The Big News is Ping An AssetManagement¡¯s notification
        that it has built up a 5% position in HSBC through Stock Connectchannels. This implies that the other Stock
        Connect investors own less than HK$8bn in HSBCshares. Also, since we warned of net selling by Mainland
        investors, Sunny Optical and AACTechnologies have fallen substantially. Last week, Mainland investors started to
        buy back AACTechnologies, but not the other two tech stocks. Insurance companies, cement companies andsome
        property stocks saw some selling, while there was buying in non-bank financials, IPPs andpharmaceutical
        companies.</p>
