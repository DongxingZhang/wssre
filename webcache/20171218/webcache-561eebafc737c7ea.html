    <p> President Kuczynski of Peru is scheduled to attend congressional hearing andexplain links with Odebrecht.
        Odebrecht revealed documents showing that it paid$782mn to Westfield Capital, a financial advisory firm owned by
        President PedroPablo Kuczynski between November 2004 and December 2007, coinciding withsome periods when he
        served as premier and minister of finance for formerpresident Alejandro Toledo. President Kuczynski denies any
        undue links with theBrazilian construction company. Popular Force, Keiko Fujimori's majority party incongress,
        has demanded the president's resignation. Other opposition parties areconsidering invoking a presidential
        vacancy (the procedure requires a qualified2/3 majority of at least 87 of the 130 votes in the unicameral
        congress). While it isstill premature to predict the likelihood of a presidential vacancy without
        hearingKuczynski's testimony, it is reasonable to assume that political pressure againstthe president is likely
        to intensify in the next couple of weeks.<br/><br/>
        Nevertheless, robust fundamentals and mining impulse could cushion impact onasset prices. Currency, rates and
        credit markets are likely to take a hit, but theprospects of an institutional solution to the crisis, strong
        international reservesbuffers and a favorable external environment could cushion the political shockand mitigate
        some of the impact on asset prices. The Central Bank is likely to takethe baton in a transition scenario
        prolonging its easing cycle and actively sellingreserves to smooth currency volatility. The largest impact would
        likely be felt ondomestic demand and economic growth, through lower non-mining investment,reconstruction and
        public works, private consumption and business confidence.</p>
