    <p> Investment Strategy: Dec FOMC meeting a slight positive surprise<br/><br/>
        The projections from the Dec FOMC meeting clearly indicate the Fed is confident in the US economy,expecting
        steady yet pretty strong GDP growth and high labor participation in the coming year, andinflation to be kept
        well under control. Interest rates will continue to rise gradually and the balancesheet will continue to shrink
        at a scheduled pace. We view this FOMC meeting positively, and believeit will boost market sentiment. Besides,
        with the imminent approval of the US tax bill beforeChristmas, it bodes well for companies with high exposure to
        the US market, especially its consumermarket.<br/><br/>
        Xtep (1368HK, Buy): Chairman buys shares in secondary market; maintain Buy<br/><br/>
        The company¡¯s Chairman purchased 1.01m shares (0.05% of issued shares) at an average price ofHK$2.8677on Dec 12.
        Although the purchase size was not big, we still see this as a positive signal.His previous share purchase
        proved favorable, buying a total of 5.5m shares at HK$2.49-2.92between July 6-10, 2015; the stock later rallied
        and reached HK$4.74on Nov 20, 2015. The recentprofit warning for a 25-35% net profit decline in FY17clears most
        uncertainties regarding FY17results, and we believe its inventory repurchases could be the final step in the
        company's three-yeartransformation. Maintain Buy and TP of HK$3.22.</p>
