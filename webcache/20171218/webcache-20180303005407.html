    <p> We believe that, after 28bp of pnl (allocation of USD30k DV01), it is time to take profits on thereceiving
        position in DI Jan-19.<br/><br/>
        Granted, both our factor model and the extrapolation of the projected terminal Selic from oureconomists show
        that there is still premium embedded into this tenor (Table 1 and Chart 1).<br/><br/>
        However, one thing is the theoretical price at maturity for DI Jan-19 and the pnl of holding thepositing until
        then and the other one, the opportunity cost of being exposed to undesirablevolatility ahead of critical and
        uncertain domestic events. This is the main reason why werecommend investors to lock in profits now.<br/><br/>
        In terms of allocation in the short term/belly of the curve, we are also receiving rates on the FRAJan-20/Jan-21
        for the reasons shown in Chart 1 below.</p>
