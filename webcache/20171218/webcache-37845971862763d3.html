    <p> Summary. Conglomerates has been a sector ignored by investors for most of this year. Following the sharp market
        correction in thepast two weeks, we believe some conglomerates stocks are deeply undervalued, which offers
        buying opportunities to investors with alonger investment horizon. For Swire B (0087.HK), its discount relative
        to Swire A (0019.HK) is at a multi-year low, and it is also verycheap in terms of absolute valuation at 0.41x
        PBR. Meanwhile, the stub value of Beijing Enterprises (0392.HK) has entered neg ativeterritory, which also makes
        it looks attractive.<br/><br/>
        Conglomerates: one of the most underperforming sectors in 2017. Although the Hang Seng Index posted about an 11%
        return inthe past six months, the performance of conglomerates was largely flat during the same period, largely
        because of limited news flowand catalysts. As a result of limited market attention, some conglomerates stocks
        are trading at a very low valuation, especi ally afterthe market correction in the past two weeks. Some of them
        deserve a revisit, in our view, such as Swire B and Beijing Enterprises.<br/><br/>
        Swire B: Discount to Swire A at a multi-year high. In terms of assets without considering voting rights, five
        shares of Swire B areequivalent to one share of Swire A. In the past 10 years, Swire B has usually been trading
        between a 5% premium and a 10% discountrelative to Swire A. However, we note that the discount has widened in
        recent months, with the latest discount 16.1%, the deepestdiscount in the past 10 years.<br/><br/>
        Current PBR reflects most of the negatives. We understand that the disappointing performance of Cathay Pacific
        (0293.HK),HAECO Americas and Swire Pacific Offshore has led to the weak share price performance of both Swire A
        and B YTD. However, at0.41x PBR, Swire B is trading at a valuation similar to the stressed level in 2008, which
        should reflect most of the negative s. In particular,Swire B looks even more attractive at its 16% discount to
        Swire A.</p>
