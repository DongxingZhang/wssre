    <p> We updated our USDCLP positioning model based on DTCC data (Latam FX:Extracting positioning from DTCC
        data).<br/><br/>
        During the week, the positioning model spiked up considerably and breachedthrough the 90th-percentile of the
        historical distribution.<br/><br/>
        As a matter of fact, the non-parametric p-value is equivalent to 5.8% - a pointwhere a reversal took place at
        the majority of times.<br/><br/>
        In terms of strategy, our fair value FX model for USDCLP is currently at 647.<br/><br/>
        However, given the proximity of the second round of the presidential election, wedo not believe it is the right
        time to open new positions.</p>
