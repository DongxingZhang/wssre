    <p> Non-Ferrous: Supportive NEV policies to drive lithium and cobalt prices<br/><br/>
        The CPC¡¯s central office and the state council¡¯s general office have recently issued a set ofadministrative
        rules, requiring CPC and central government agencies to take the lead in usingdomestically produced and new
        energy vehicles. This is in line with recent policy measures such asthe fuel consumption and NEV credit score
        system as well as driving restrictions and car purchaserestrictions, all of which should help support
        mid/long-term industry development after NEV subsidiesare withdrawn. The issuance of favorable policies and
        surging NEV production/sales towards yearendshould drive upstream lithium and cobalt demand and
        prices.<br/><br/>
