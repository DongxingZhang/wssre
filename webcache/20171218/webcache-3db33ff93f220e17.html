    <p> Better-than-expected excavator sales volume in Nov According to the ChinaConstruction Machinery Association
        (CCMA), 13,822 excavators were sold in Chinaduring Nov, up 107.4% YoY and better than market expectation of
        10,000 units. Novsales volume was also much higher than Oct¡¯s 10,541 units. Total excavator salesvolume during
        11M17 reached 126,298 units, up 99.2% YoY. We expect this to reach140,000 units in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Strong sales driven by replacement demand As stated in our 2018 outlook report,construction machinery sales are
        recovering, a trend that we expect to continue in 2018,mainly driven by FAI and the replacement cycle.<br/><br/>
        Lonking¡¯s sales volume grew at a faster rate of 67.5% in Nov Lonking¡¯s constructionmachinery sales volume rose
        by 67.5% YoY, compared with 46.8% in Oct. Excavatorsales volume continued to outperform peers, with growth
        surging 145.5% YoY,compared with the market average of 107.4% YoY. The figures show the company¡¯smarket share
        continues to expand. Meanwhile, forklift sales volume grew at a faster rateof 81.4%, exceeding our expectation.
        Wheel loader sales volume increased by 35.1%YoY, we believe in line with market expectation, whereas road
        rollers slowed to 25%YoY.<br/><br/>
        Lonking¡¯s forklifts segment likely to maintain momentum According tomanagement, its new forklift manufacturing
        plant in Yingxi with capacity of 15,000 unitsper year (equivalent to 58% of current capacity) will begin
        operation by the end of thismonth. Given that its current manufacturing facility is operating at full capacity,
        the newcapacity will help to spur extra momentum for Lonking next year.<br/><br/>
        Lonking¡¯s 2017 results likely to beat expectations During 11M17, sales volume ofloaders, excavators, forklifts
        and road rollers grew by 65.1%, 127.1%, 53% and 43.9%YoY respectively. Excavator and forklift growth was higher
        than we had expected whileloader and road roller growth was broadly in line with our estimates. Meanwhile,
        thecompany raised its ASP for loaders by ~7% in Oct, which will have a positive impact on4Q17 results. We
        estimate revenue/net profit will increase by 66%/81% in 2017, whilethe market expects revenue/net profit to rise
        by 52%/75%. We believe it is highly likelythat Lonking¡¯s 2017 results will beat market expectation.<br/><br/>
        Reiterate Buy on Lonking Lonking¡¯s recent weak stock performance was mainly due toconcerns about Nov sales
        volume in China, particularly for heavy-duty trucks, for whichweak sales figures were announced a few days ago.
        We believe the strong Novexcavator sales volume should help to ease market concerns. The stock is
        currentlytrading as 10.6x 2018E P/E; we maintain our Buy rating and target price of HK$4.30.</p>
