    <p> Sibanye makes an all-share offer of R5.15bn/GBP285m for Lonmin<br/><br/>
        Sibanye-Stillwater has offered to acquire Lonmin for R5.15bn/GBP285m in a sharedeal recommended by Lonmin¡¯s
        Board. Sibanye-Stillwater will gain a ¡°mine-tomarket¡±route by 2021through Lonmin¡¯s downstream processing
        capacity, hasidentified pre-tax synergies it quantifies at c.R1.5bn p.a. by 2021and also
        acquiresresources/reserves which will comprise c.58% of the combined PGM operationsin South Africa. The offer
        comes ahead of a restructuring of the loss-makingMarikana operations which envisages the planned retrenchment of
        39% (12,600)of Lonmins 32.5k employees (including contractors) over a three-year period.Shareholder approval for
        the deal is required (50% for Sibanye-Stillwater and 75%for Lonmin), as well as competition &amp; regulatory
        approvals (South Africa, UK&amp; potentially EU). Management estimate the scheme will become effective inthe
        second half of 2018. It appears on our first-take that the Sibanye-Stillwateroffer makes sense for both parties
        given 1) the value on offer on the processingbenefits for Sibanye, and 2) Lonmin's single operation currently
        operating at aloss. However, Lonmin Marikana's proposed restructuring and the realisation ofsynergies is
        required for Marikana to cease being free cash flow negative andbeing a drag on the valuation of the acquired
        assets, in our view.<br/><br/>
        R5.15bn/GBP285m consideration: 0.967new share for each Lonmin share<br/><br/>
        On a 30-day VWAP of Sibanye the offer values Lonmin at GBP285m/GBp100psor R5.15bn/R18.06ps (using R18.06/GBP).
        This is a 44%-57% premium to theprevious closing price of Lonmin of GBp63.8ps/R12.50. In our note of
        7August2017, ¡®Lonmin Plc ¡°Jumble sale¡±¡¯ we estimated that the spare capacity ofLonmin¡¯s downstream processing to
        be worth R830m p.a. for a producer ofconcentrate in avoided tolling fees/discount sales values less additional
        variablecosts. Sibanye-Stillwater has identified cost benefits of processing synergies atc.R780m per annum by
        2021and intends to acquire a new furnace for R1bn. Onthis basis, it appears to us that Sibanye's offer is for
        value on the processing side.However, the mining assets are currently free cash flow negative and
        realisedsynergies are needed to reverse this, in our view.<br/><br/>
        R1.5bn p.a. in identified synergies: R780m processing; R730m overheards<br/><br/>
        Sibanye-Stillwater believe there are synergies on offer of R1.5bn p.a. comprisingR730m p.a. in saved overheads
        and the R780m p.a. in processing synergies (perthe above). Unquantifiable synergies at this point also exist in
        owning contiguousproperties through ability to mine through existing boundaries, optimize use ofsurface
        infrastructure, mining mix and more effective capital allocation.</p>
