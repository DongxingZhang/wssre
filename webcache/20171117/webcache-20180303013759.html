    <p> A strong recovery from 2Q17but insufficient to excite investors, in our view<br/><br/>
        We maintain our Hold rating on Wilmar (WIL) because<br/><br/>
        (1) its trading nature isunlikely to attract new investors to lift share price and<br/><br/>
        (2) lack of long termstructural catalysts to offset investors¡¯ perception of its trading nature. But wedo
        acknowledge Wilmar has stood out as the most well managed trading firmamongst its peers. Its consistent US$1bn
        net profit mark is substantially betterrelative to peers. Strategic investors like ADM have invested constantly
        at theS$3level offsetting Martua¡¯s sell down, thus offering downside support.<br/><br/>
        Low predictability means expectations are likely to be generally wrong<br/><br/>
        3Q17core profit jumped 8-fold QoQ to US$324mn, lifting 9M17core profit by74% to US$674mn. 9M17core profit is 68%
        of ours and consensus forecast,suggesting market has got it wrong again. Given WIL¡¯s trading nature, it ismore
        important to study historical trends than make forecasts. However, WILmerged four segments¡¯ PBT into two in its
        1Q15results, making it moredifficult to analyze already unclear financials. Moreover, WIL trading positionsare
        proprietary information which makes access impossible too.</p>
