    <p> The short end of the IBR curve has adjusted to BanRep¡¯s last rate cut and is pricingin around 65bp of easing by
        mid-2018. Thereafter, an immediate monetary policytightening (back up to the current 5% level in 18 months) is
        priced in.<br/><br/>
        In this piece, we study the central bank¡¯s response to shifts in inflationexpectations.<br/><br/>
        BNP Paribas forecasts for headline inflation to fall towards the central bank¡¯starget, combined with monetary
        policy expectations, suggest there is scope for theIBR curve (9m to 18m) to flatten significantly, in our
        view.<br/><br/>
        In addition, this medium-term flattener benefits from a high positive carry. Curvemoves would have to be very
        different to our scenario for the strategy to losemoney.<br/><br/>
        We are entering a 9m payer against an 18m IBR receiver at 9bp. Allocation: USD20k DV01. Initial target: -15bp.
        Stop loss: 35bp.<br/><br/>
        Carry is positive at 7.5bp/month.</p>
