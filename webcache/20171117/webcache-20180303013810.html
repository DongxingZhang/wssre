    <p> Insurance: 2018sector outlook ¨C favorable regulatory and macro conditions for leading HKlistedlife insurers<br/><br/>
        We see a positive outlook for the China life insurance sector, given: 1) concerns about performancein the
        2018¡°jump-start¡± season have been alleviated; 2) improved life insurance business quality interms of premiums
        structure and NBM; 3) life insurance companies may benefit from the rising 750DMAfor the 10Y government bond,
        and; 4) the tax-deferred pension plan is a long-term positive.Leading life insurers will benefit most from
        enhanced regulation. We have Buy ratings on all majorChina life insurance companies: Ping An, China Life, CPIC,
        and NCI.<br/><br/>
        Securities: 2018sector outlook ¨C positive outlook for the China securities sector; recommendHK-based Chinese
        securities companies<br/><br/>
        Asset management, interest income, and proprietary trading income are making increasingcontributions to sector
        revenue, benefiting well-diversified brokers. The larger players have generallyposted more stable financial
        performance in 2017. As a result, we prefer large and well-diversifiedChina brokers, such as CITIC Securities
        and Huatai Securities. Business quality at HK-basedChinese brokers has also been enhanced, with companies such
        as Haitong International and GuotaiJunan International making substantial progress. HK-based Chinese brokers
        should also benefitmost from HKEx¡¯s ¡®Connect¡¯ strategy and the increasing demand for overseas asset
        allocation.Guotai Junan International is our top pick.<br/><br/>
        China Property Sector: NBS data show continued drop in primary sales area in Oct<br/><br/>
        NBS data for Oct released yesterday show total property investment rose 7.8% YoY, while residentialproperty
        investment rose 10% YoY. According to our calculations, primary residential GFA solddropped 9% YoY and 18% MoM,
        while property sales revenue dropped 3% YoY. The continueddecline in residential GFA sold in Oct is in line with
        our forecast for a new down-cycle. We expectmost China developers to post declining contract sales in 2018, and
        see limited catalysts for thesector. We prefer developers likely to exceed sales and earnings consensus, and
        land-owners in theGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area.<br/><br/>
        Yuexiu Property (123HK, Buy): Disposal of Wuhan commercial properties to subsidiaryYuexiu REIT, one off gain of
        Rmb400m<br/><br/>
        The company announced the sale of its 67% interest in two Wuhan commercial property projects toits subsidiary
        Yuexiu REIT for Rmb2.28bn. The company will book after tax earnings of Rmb400monce this disposal is completed.
        We expect the company to dispose more non-Guangzhoucommercial property projects to Yuexiu REIT in 2018. Yuexiu
        Property is trading at 0.5x 2017E NBV,which we see as cheap given its 7.7m sqm land bank in the
        Guangdong-HK-Macau Bay Area and2018earnings growth that is likely to exceed market expectations.<br/><br/>
        CR Pharma (3320HK, Buy): MSCI index inclusion should lead to sustained valuation premium<br/><br/>
        CR Pharma has been included in the MSCI China index in its latest semi-annual review. This is inline with what
        we have previously flagged, and should lead to a sustained valuation premium overpeers. The company signed a
        distribution agreement on Nov 10with Beigene to distribute threeblockbuster products in China, which we believe
        will be earnings accretive. We expect the companyto maintain above-peer profitability in FY17-18on an expansion
        of its distribution network, stablegrowth in its manufacturing business, and a more proactive M&amp;A; strategy.
        Maintain Buy.</p>
