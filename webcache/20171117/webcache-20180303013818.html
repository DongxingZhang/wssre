    <p> Although Macquarie¡¯s equity strategists believe that stock market leaders willcontinue to do well in this market
        environment, we have done a systematicscreening exercise looking for market laggards. We have performed two

        underperformed, both on a Year to Date basis and for the lastthree months.</p>
