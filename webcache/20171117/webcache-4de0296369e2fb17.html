    <p> Sogou and news app as the potential growth drivers. 3Q results were better thanexpected with revenue exceeding
        consensus by 5% and recurring operating marginreturning to breakeven for the first time since 1Q16. We believe
        Sogou, the searchsubsidiary of Sohu, and the AI-backed news app could be the future growth engine.<br/><br/>
        1) Sogou: In 3Q17, Sogou revenue growth further accelerated to 55% y-o-y,compared with 20% in 2Q and 10% in
        1Q17. Growth was mainly driven by 24% y-o-ygrowth in traffic, of which mobile traffic grew more than 38% y-o-y.
        In 3Q, Tencentbegan testing the integration of Sogou Search into Weixin, which allows users toaccess all
        Internet information through Sogou general search function from Weixin.<br/><br/>
        The user base of Sogou Mobile Keyboard is expanding rapidly by 55% y-o-y. Goingforward, Sogou should continue to
        strengthen competitive advantages in search fromchannel to content, leveraging the partnership with Tencent. 2)
        News App: In 3Q,Sohu introduced more short video content to its news app and adjusted itsrecommendation
        algorithm, leveraging machine-learning technology. It will launch anew version of its News App in November with
        some innovative upgrades andimproved algorithms. The company expects an immediate 30% boost in page viewsafter
        launching the new version of the app. Sohu believes the healthy growth of SMEclients will help monetize the
        incremental growth in traffic.<br/><br/>
        Revenue beat; recurring operating margin reached breakeven. Total revenueamounted to USD516m, up 26% y-o-y,
        exceeding mid-range guidance by 4%. Thebrand advertising business remained weak with USD74m revenue, down 33%
        y-o-ydue to lacklustre video ad sales. Sogou revenue rose by 55% y-o-y to USD257m,with growth accelerating from
        0% y-o-y in 2016, due to the low base since May 2016and technology improvement. Online game revenue amounted to
        USD132m, up 34%y-o-y. Operating margin excluding one-off impairment from Changyou was 2.3%,which is the first
        quarter above breakeven since 1Q16. Loss per share was USD2.38,compared with previous guidance of USD1.00-1.25,
        mainly due to offline impairment.<br/><br/>
        Raise TP to USD65 from USD62 and maintain Hold. We raise our 2017-19erevenue estimates by 3/8/8%, and revise up
        EPS to -USD6.70, +USD0.61, andUSD2.17 (from -USD5.41, -USD1.54, and USD0.53). Our SOTP-based TP of USD65implies
        potential upside of 11.5% and we maintain Hold on the stock, as the visibilityof Sohu¡¯s business remains
        unclear. Key upside risk: Potential IPO of Sogou. Keydownside risk: competition from other search players.</p>
