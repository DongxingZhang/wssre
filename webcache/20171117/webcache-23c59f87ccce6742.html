    <p> China Huarong AMC ¨C Stay OW post new supply, dated Nov 3<br/><br/>
        In this note we present our views on the recently completed multi-tranchebond issuance by China Huarong Asset
        Management (HRAM). Fundamentally,we remain constructive on HRAM, its near-term business dynamics (incl. thatof
        its banking subsidiary) and its ability to maintain credit ratings at theircurrent levels, despite the Negative
        outlook by S&amp;P.; We continue to seepockets of value along HRAM¡¯s curve despite the recent material
        tightening ofspreads together with the rest of China IG universe</p>
