    <p> Brands¡¯ 2017Singles Day snapshot<br/><br/>
        Baozun reported a 100% growth in transaction value during the ninth SinglesDay to RMB5b (incl. brands not
        contributing to GMV). Total orders during SinglesDay reached 12m (+87% YoY), indicating some ARPU improvement.
        We feel therobust performance is largely in-line with the brands¡¯ expectation. There were 10stores that
        surpassed RMB100m sales (vs 6last year), 7stores overtook RMB50m+ (in-line with last year), and 33stores
        achieved RMB10m+ (vs 22last year). Nike,the biggest client of Baozun, surpassed RMB1b online sales during the
        day (DBeover 100% growth). We attribute Baozun's strong operation capability during thepromotion day to broader
        utilization of technology, including smart logistics anddigitalized monitoring system. We expect more a detailed
        disclosure on SinglesDay brands performance in the coming 3Q results.<br/><br/>
        Smart logistics being used<br/><br/>

        the parcels¡¯ status in real time. The companyutilized a higher automation with 100+ types of automated tools,
        spanning aTmall storefront update, real-time inventory management, order and couponprocessing, data collection,
        and product returns. The digitalized smart monitoringsystem records parcels' routes, logistics transit, and
