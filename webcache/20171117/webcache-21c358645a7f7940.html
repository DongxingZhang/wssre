    <p> Broadband-Narrowband convergence and emerging markets major catalysts for global private network growth over the
        next seven years.Analog and digital communications respectively underpinned 55%and 41%of the global private
        network market in 2016, with analog expected to contract to 32%and digital expand to 61%by 2020, accordingto
        IHS. Theswitch from analog to digitalin recent yearshas boosted revenues for private network system and terminal
        providers, while the next seven years will see broadband-narrowband convergence and emerging markets pick up the
        baton todrive the next wave of growth, with global broadband private network market size anticipated to advance
        at a CAGR of over 23%to USD2.6bn by 2020, and emerging markets in regions likeSouth America, countries along the
        Belt and Road and Africa estimated to be worth an aggregate RMB150bn for years to come.<br/><br/>
        Hytera, one of few companies in the world that can providea full suite of cutting-edge Professional Digital
        Trunking (PDT), digital mobile radio (DMR)and Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)products and solutions,is poised
        for solid growth over the next two yearson the back of: (1) its predominant position in the public safety field;
        (2) rising market shares in the metro transportation and commercial sectors thanks to its leading DMR/TETRA
        technologies; (3) continuously high input into R&amp;D; to shorten the gap with broadband system vendors; and
        (4) an extensive global sales network of nearly 1,000 dealers around the world.We thereby projectHytera to reach
        a revenue of RMB5.4bn/7.7bn in 2017/2018, up 58%/41% YoY. Recommenda Buy rating.<br/><br/>
        Risk factors:(1) rivalslike Huawei and TD Techwill keepchipping away atHytera, in our view; (2) expansion in the
        European private network market may be held back by fiercecompetition; (3)Sepuramay continue to lose money if
        its integration misses expectations; and (4)Motorola Solutions¡¯s ongoing patent actions against Hytera in the
        US, Germany and Australia expose Hyterato substantial claimsrisks.</p>
