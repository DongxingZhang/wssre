    <p> Strong operating profitability and healthy liquidity<br/><br/>
        Saudi Electricity Company (SECO) reported headline 3Q17financial resultsearlier this week reflecting strong
        operating performance and healthy liquidity.Top line earnings were weak as 3Q17revenues declined slightly (-1.3%
        YoY)and 9M17revenues were flat YoY due to lower electricity sales on account ofshift in sales mix. However, this
        was more than compensated by strong costdiscipline and special measures (cancellation of municipalities¡¯ fees)
        whichdrove 3Q17and 9M17reported EBITDA up by 8.5% and 42.5% YoYrespectively. EBITDA margin also boosted
        resultantly, expanding 520bps YoYto 57.2% for 3Q17. Looking further into cost dynamics, 9M17fuel costsdeclined
        by 6.5% YoY and operational and maintenance cost was down 13.1%YoY. This was partially offset by increase in
        power purchase cost due to higheroutput from IPPs generations. 9M17EBITDA growth was also significantlyboosted
        by a special measure including reversal of accrued historicalmunicipalities¡¯ fees of SAR6.1bn following a royal
        decree to cancelmunicipalities¡¯ fees in Feb-2017. Excluding the aforementioned one-off item,3Q17and 9M17EBITDA
        growth would still have been solid at 7.2% and 8.9%respectively. 3Q17reported net profit grew 6.8% YoY (excl.
        one off +4.4%YoY) to SAR5.3bn while 9M17net profit almost doubled YoY to SAR12.4bn(excl. one-off +1%).<br/><br/>
        Cash flow update: 9M17Cash flow from operations (CFO) increased by ahealthy 30% YoY to SAR26.8bn. This was
        mainly driven by improved workingcapital management driven by lower inventory, accounts payable and
        prepaidexpenses. Capex programme continued in line with SECO¡¯s commitmenttotaling SAR32.1bn in 9M17. Overall
        liquidity improved significantly, withgross cash position more than doubling to SAR2.8bn as of end 9M17.</p>
