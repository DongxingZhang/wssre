        The duration of the equity rally without a typical 3-5% pullback has been veryunusual, and the rally is on track
        to become the longest since WWII. But the speedand the size of the rally have not been unusual and the S&amp;P;
        500is well within itstrend channel of this economic recovery defined back in 2010-2011during thebig pull- and
        snap-backs then. The rally has been driven by earnings while themultiple has been in a narrow range over the
        last year. While multiples are highrelative to their historical averages they are in line with their historical
        drivers.</p>
