    <p> New policy announced in Nov-17 to spur a rush of NEV PV sales ahead of year-end. In viewof the solid sales
        ramp-up in 10M17 and mitigating NEV policy impacts, we expect total NEV PV sales to exceed 500k units in FY17E
        and become the primary NEV sales growth driver in 4Q17, especially after the announcement of the new scheme in
        Nov-17 to restrict OEMs from launching new models in FY18E if they have failed to meet the gas consumption
        requirement for the FY16/17 period. To avoid additional higher expenses related to the non-conformity to the
        requirement, we expect to see strong NEV PV shipments in 4Q17, as OEMs may capture the time window to make a
        push before 2018 which may make it more difficult for some OEMs to launch new models given the stricter
        requirement.<br/><br/>
        ICE shipment growth rapidly slowdownin Oct-17 due to weakPV sedansales growth.Although the sales growth of ICE
        vehicles has picked up significantly to 5.8% YoY in 3Q17 from merely 1.1% YoY in 2Q17, the shipmentgrowth during
        the traditional peak season has slowed down rapidly due to weak PV sedan sales.Thus, we anticipate ICE shipment
        growth would remain meagre in 4Q17, given the weak demand in the mass market signaledby the increasing
        dealers¡¯inventory in Oct-17 following the emerging discrepancy between retail and wholesale growth amid the peak
        season. Meanwhile, we believe PV SUVswith displacement below 1.6L will remain the major catalyst in driving
        sales growth in 4Q17 in anticipation of the purchase tax will roll back to 10% in FY18E.<br/><br/>
        PV OEMs posted third consecutive quarter margin declines, while stable margins for CV OEMs.Given the tepid ICE
        sales and increasingcommodity prices during 3Q17, we expect PV OEMs¡¯ average margins to continue to decline in
        4Q17, while we believe CV OEMs¡¯ margins will tend to be more stable than that of the PV players due to the solid
        demand from domestic infrastructure construction year-to-date. NEV suppliers have also seentheir margins decline
        in the first three quarters due to ASP reduction after the subsidy cuts; however, we expect to see improvement
        in their revenue and earnings growth in4Q17 on assumption of improvement in NEV shipment growth going forward.
