    <p> Near-term deliveries to accelerate; the sector's recovery remains intact<br/><br/>
        We recently visited CRRC's four major subsidiaries, including three assemblingfactories and one system supplier,
        which together accounted for 80% of CRRC'stotal NP in 2016. All the factories we visited are running at very
        high utilization,suggesting that deliveries of rolling stocks are set to accelerate. This suggeststhat Zhuzhou
        CRRC's soft 3Q was just a matter of timing for revenue recognition,which we expect to catch up in 4Q. Overall,
        this trip reaffirms our positive view onthis sector. EMU demand should revert to 400+ sets in 2019-20(vs.
        consensus:<br/><br/>
        300-350sets) and heavy maintenance should strengthen the segment's growthvisibility over the mid-to-long term,
        while rapid transit vehicle (RTV) demandmay positively surprise the market. We see the latest correction as a
        buyingopportunity for Zhuzhou and CRRC-H.</p>
