    <p> Expectations are for a Fed hike in December and for a tight labor market to putupward pressure on longer-term
        rates. This, along with changes at the Fed, israising investor concerns that higher yields will impede the
        market¡¯s advance.<br/><br/>
        Conventional wisdom holds that rising rates threaten equity valuations. Bycontrast, the data shows that when
        yields are depressed¡ªas they are today¡ªstock prices and interest rates move in tandem.<br/><br/>
        The question, then, is at what point rising rates become a burden.<br/><br/>
        As Figure 1 shows, P/Es have historically moved higher until the 10-yearTreasury reaches 5%. However, the
        research presented in this note showsthat this tipping point has likely fallen to 3?%, in response to the
        currentslower-growth environment. With Treasury yields below 2?% today, thisimplies that stock valuations will
        not be challenged by rising rates for quitesome time.<br/><br/>
        While investors typically focus on the effect of the Fed¡¯s actions on stockprices, changes in longer-dated
        Treasuries have a far greater impact. Further,the correlation between Fed Funds and multiples has largely broken
        downsince the introduction of uber-accommodative policy in 2008.</p>
