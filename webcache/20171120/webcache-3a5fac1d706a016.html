    <p> Q3 gaming softnessas expected; newsurvivalgames top charts.<br/><br/>
        In 3Q17, total revenue grew 35% YoY or -7% QoQ to RMB12.5bn,1%lower thanconsensus, dragged by continued weakness
        in gaming, despite continued strength in eC. We expect NetEase’s overall gaming revenue to remain weakin 4Q17,
        and we are modelling a low single digit QoQ decline in total online game net revenue.In our Oct 10 note, we have
        said that NTES’R&amp;D; teams areworking hard to roll outsurvivalgames(PUBG-type), with some 10 ongoing
        projects.Earlyin Nov, its newsurvivalgames have reached top spots on iOS free download charts: 1) Survival in
        the Wilderness(荒野行动)and 2)Terminator 2: Judgment Day(终结者2:审判日). It will focus on attracting user first and will
        monetize via innovative game play, without impacting game balance.On Minecraft, 1) iOS version was first
        launchedon Sep 15, which topped D/Lranking chart, followedby 2) Android version onOct 12, with downloads
        exceeding30mn.Monetizationwill not gain traction until 2H18, and is likely to come from 1) content sales: maps,
        skins and texture packs, and 2) server hosting: charge by cloud server hosting usage. Looking ahead, we believe
        key upside surprisecouldcome from 1) Wilderness and 2) newly launched games: ChuLiuXiang, Tribes and Empire,and
        Forever 7.<br/><br/>
        Non-gaminggrowthled by strength in eC, Kaola and YanXuan.<br/><br/>
        E-mail, e-commerce and others net revenues were RMB3.7bn, up 80% YoYand 11% QoQ (69% YoY in 2Q17).We
        believeitseC biz (Kaola and Yanxuan) are progressing well driven by strong monthly run-rate of Yanxuan and the
        rapidly growing popularity of cross-border eC. Given intensified eCcompetition in 2H17, we expect Kaolaand
        YanXuanto stay loss-makingin the near future. Nevertheless, Kaola is also trying to lower cost from suppliers,
        and as rising GMV and higher operating leverage start to kick in, we expect marginexpansionin the long-run.<br/><br/>
        Positive on its capability to roll out blockbuster game; Maintain BUY.<br/><br/>
        We expect new games’monetization torevive gaming growth momentuminearly2018. Maintain BUY, but loweredour TP
        toUS$330, on FY18EEV/EBITDAof 15.2x.Catalysts: commercialization of survival games and RPGgames. NTESis trading
        at 14x FY18E EV/EBITDA, at a discount to its largest competitor,Tencent(27x, 700 HK).</p>
