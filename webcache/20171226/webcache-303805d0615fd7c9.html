    <p> 2018another good year for chemicals earnings; initiating Korean coverage<br/><br/>
        The outlook for the petrochemical sector continues to be positive; Asian chemicalcompanies' weighted spreads
        will likely be maintained despite a high base. Weare bullish based on prolonged peak earnings driven by supply
        side discipline,potential further delays or cancellations in projects and stringent environmentalmeasures
        disrupting supply. Hence, the key themes in 2018are: 1) ethylene cyclesoftens but with limited damage to
        spreads; 2) non-PE continues to strengthen inthe absence of naphtha cracker (NCC) additions; and 3)
        environmental constraintsboosting the chlor-alkali chain cycle. Thus, we initiate our Korean coverage withBuy
        ratings on LG Chem &amp; Kumho Petrochem, and Hold ratings on Lotte Chem&amp; Hanwha Chem.<br/><br/>
        Ethylene cycle rolling off but spreads sustain at high level<br/><br/>
        We expect PE chain spreads will ease back from their peak but remain healthy,after a highly profitable 2017.
        Based on our global ethylene model, 2018/19Eutilization rate will decline to 89% / 88%, still within mid-cycle.
        With the additionalgas-ethane-based supply from the US, we continue to see risks of delays,outages, and slower
        ramp-up, and even Chinese ban on recycled plastics importsto support the cycle. Best leverage to theme: PTTGC,
        Lotte Chem, &amp; Chandra Asri.Non-ethylene: structurally upbeat with synthetic rubber leading the wayTight
        supply demand is heading for the non-PE cycle given limited NCC additionsgoing forward since 67% of 2018E/19E
        new additions to capacity are gas-ethanebased,which focus on ethylene. We expect the non-PE utilization rate to
        increaseby 1.5% yoy in 2018E while synthetic rubber is the best product area with +4.3%yoy improvement. In our
        view, Asia naphtha crackers with good exposure tonon-PE will enjoy this imminent upcycle. Best leverage to the
        theme: LG Chem,Kumho, SPC, &amp; IRPC.</p>
