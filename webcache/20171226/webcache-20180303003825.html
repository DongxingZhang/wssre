    <p> The CNB's Bank Board decided to keep interest rates unchanged. Thetwo-week repo rate (2W repo rate) was
        maintained at 0.50%, the discountrate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.<br/><br/>
        The average evolution of the Czech Koruna during Q4 was strongerthan the CNB's expectations. This fact, together
        with lack of meaningfulslippage of actual data from current CNB's forecasts were the mainreasons behind the
        decision today.<br/><br/>
        The CNB delivered some tightening this month via macro-prudentialmeasures aimed to curb overheating in housing
        loans growth. Beyondcontaining risks to financial stability, the tightening of the buffers helpsdampen the
        feedback loop between property prices, housing loans,imputed rents and core inflation.<br/><br/>
        We continue to expect two 25bps hikes in 2018 (one more hike thanactually implied in the CNB's baseline). Upside
        risks for the call continueto be wage growth surprises and risks that the current (minority)government
        overspends to stay afloat. For now however, our inflationprojections remain unsupportive of an aggressive rate
        hike cycle in 2018.</p>
