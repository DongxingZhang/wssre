    <p> From a rational rally in 2017 to an irrational one in 2018: We met with some 30key domestic institutional
        investors following the publication of our 2018 outlookCautiously optimistic: Stay half a step ahead (Nov 21).
        Most held highly conservativeviews regarding the market next year; few concurred with our outlook that the
        marketwould exceed expectations. We attribute this wariness to the mistaken perception that themarket is in a
        bubble and that bubbles often burst the year after a boom¡ªie, theseinvestors¡¯ intuition about this year¡¯s rally
        is off-kilter due to the trauma of dealing withpast crashes. But we hold that this year¡¯s rally was a rational
        one, not a bubble far fromfundamental growth.<br/><br/>
        Investors¡¯ actions may be significantly misaligned with their perceptions:And yet, even those prudent investors
        agree that the global macro environment shouldremain favorable, noting that global trade is driving economic
        growth and facilityinvestment is resuming in key developed markets. Despite this, their asset managementplans
        appear to have turned hyper-conservative¡ªa serious risk, in our view. We fear thatthose with an inflexible
        investment attitude will be late to the party, finally surrenderingand jumping into the bull market just as it
        is on its last legs.</p>
