    <p> Bharti closes the product gap but at a cost.<br/><br/>
        While Jio has maintained the momentum on subscriber additions, Bharti hasbeen inching closer on data and voice
        usage metrics. Overall, Jio reportedrevenue of Rs69bn and EBITDA margin of 38.2% compared to Rs107.5bn and32.6%
        margin for Bharti. There are reporting differences which understate Jio¡¯srevenues and overstate margin relative
        to Bharti. Jio¡¯s digital strategy is bestreflected in its SG&amp;A; costs which remain demonstrably lower than
        Bharti. Thekey concern is Jio pricing stance which aims to deliver more ¡®value¡¯ relative toincumbents ¨C this has
        translated to price cuts after the incumbents matchedJio¡¯s offers.<br/><br/>
        Key metrics: Jio vs Bharti.<br/><br/>
        Subscribers: Jio (160mn), Bharti (290m, of which 62m broadband subs). Netadds: Jio +21.5mn, Bharti (+6.9mn
        broadband net adds). ARPU: Jio Rs154(-1.5% QoQ) Bharti (Rs123, -15.2% QoQ). Data usage per sub: Jio
        (9.6GB),Bharti 5.3GB (+31% QoQ). Bharti¡¯s overall network throughput grew 41% QoQto 1,106mn GB compared to Jio
        14% growth to 4,310mn GB.<br/><br/>
        Jio network and SG&amp;A; costs are significantly lower compared to Bharti.<br/><br/>
        Jio¡¯s network opex (Rs17.3bn) is half of Bharti (36.4bn) though the mobile sitecount is likely to be closer
        (120K est for Jio vs 160K for Bharti). However, Jio¡¯ssites are largely owned compared to Bharti (rented), thus
        impacting networkcosts. Jio¡¯s SG&amp;A; costs (Rs4.7bn) are dramatically lower compared to Bharti(Rs23bn) ¨C this
        is likely due to Jio¡¯s successful usage of its app to deliver all itsdiscount offers and plan recharges. We
        believe this will remain a major sourceof competitive advantage for Jio in the medium term (table inside with
        details).<br/><br/>
        Jio pricing stance remains a risk to sector revenues.<br/><br/>
        After two rounds of price increases since Apr 2017, when the service wentfrom ¡®free-to-pay¡¯, Jio recently
        changed its offers by increasing the daily datalimits or reducing its tariffs by around 10-20% (table inside).
        The companyindicated that it intends to maintain a ¡®value gap¡¯ with the incumbents ¨C a corepromise of its
        offering at launch. Jio¡¯s pricing stance remains a risk to thesector revenue table in the mid-term which has
        fallen c.10% since its launch.<br/><br/>
        D&amp;A; and finance costs are not comparable due to difference in accountingpolicies.<br/><br/>
        Jio¡¯s D&amp;A; costs (Rs12bn) and finance costs (Rs6.6bn) are significantly lowerthan Bharti (Rs41bn and
        Rs15bn). The former is using a ¡®unit of production¡¯method for its wireless network costs (spectrum &amp; capex)
        in which the costswill scale up with higher utilisation of network capacity. Bharti uses the moreprevalent a
        straight-line method. We note that Jio¡¯s estimated capitalemployed for its wireless business at $27bn is almost
        50% higher than Bharti($18bn). Jio¡¯s total capital employed stands at around $35bn.</p>
