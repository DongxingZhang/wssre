    <p> Last Friday, the HKSFC released the aggregate short positions data for January 12. Weanalyzed which companies
        may be vulnerable to short-selling activity, based on the followingthree criteria: (i) the net change in short
        positions between January 5 and January 12; (ii)short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the
        absolute amount of short positions.We must emphasize this is only an objective quantitative analysis based on
        officialdata; the analysis does NOT imply that we feel uncomfortable with the corporate governanceor
        fundamentals of some companies. According to the results of our analysis,we believe Wharf Holdings (0004.HK)
        requires close monitoring, based on its latest shortpositions outstanding. On the other hand, we note that short
        positions in Genscript Bio(1548.HK), China Eastern Airlines (0670.HK) and Value Partners (0806.HK) have
        droppedsignificantly.<br/><br/>
        Short positions in Wharf Holdings increased significantly. As Figure 2 shows, shortpositions in Wharf Holdings
        rose 21% during the week ended January 12. The outstandingshort positions were equivalent to 3.6% of its free
        float. The share price of the Companyrose by 26% in early January because of speculation on its privatization
        potential. The significantrally within a short period of time may be what attracted short sellers.
        Meanwhile,we¡¯ve also seen a sharp increase in short positions in TCL Multimedia (1070.HK) andZhengtong Auto
        (1728.HK). We believe the increase is mainly because of TCL Multimedia¡¯sproposed rights issue and Zhengtong¡¯s
        share placement.<br/><br/>
        Significant decline in short positions in Genscript, China Eastern Airlines and ValuePartners. Outstanding short
        positions in Genscript, China Eastern Airlines and Value Partnersdropped 26%, 17.4% and 16%, respectively,
        during the week ended January 12(Figure 3). We believe some investors began to close their short positions in
        Genscript afterthe share price dropped &gt;15% from the peak level early this year. Regarding China
        EasternAirlines, the strength of the RMB may have been the trigger for some investors deciding tocut their short
        positions, in our view. As for Value Partners, we believe the drop in short positionsis mainly related to the
        release of a positive profit alert.<br/><br/>
        Recap: Source of data. The HKSFC releases the aggregate short positions in all eligiblestocks every Friday with
        a delay of one week. The HKEx releases the data on short-sellingactivity on a daily basis (without a one-week
        delay), but investors do not know whether theshort positions are covered or not later. Therefore, the usefulness
        of the HKSFC data is thatit provides the outstanding short positions in each stock, and investors can trace the
        netchange on a weekly basis. However, there are still some limitations, as this data set cannotcover
        short-selling activity using OTC derivative products.<br/><br/>
        Three angles to analyzing the data. (i) The net change in short positions between January5 and January 19; (ii)
        short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the absoluteamount of the short positions.</p>
