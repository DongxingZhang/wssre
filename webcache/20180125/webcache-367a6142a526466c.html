    <p> Growth quality becomes a top priority, while also sustaining infrastructure FAI growth. Our A-share macro team
        forecasts that China¡¯s real GDP growth will slow down from 6.7-6.9% in 2016 and 2017 to 6.5% in 2018E. The most
        important thing for the central government in the coming years is to manage debt risk and meet people¡¯s growing
        expectations of a better life. We expect overall FAI to further decelerate in 2018, given tightened liquidity
        and stringent government regulations. But we don¡¯t expect infrastructure FAI growth to decelerate significantly
        in 2018. The central government won¡¯t be keen to pursue further investment growth acceleration in 2018.
        Infrastructure development is required to satisfy people¡¯s growing expectations of a better life. That said, we
        expect small-scale infrastructure FAI growth in the areas of public transportation, new energy, smart grid and
        environment protection to offset the slowdown in growth of large-scale infrastructure investment. We expect
        infrastructure FAI to grow 15.7% YoY in 2018 vs. 15.8% in 2016 and 15.6% in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Tougher government regulations on PPP projects are expected to dampen infrastructure investment in the short
        term. Some local governments were involved in misconduct related to public-private partnership (PPP)
        infrastructure projects, such as initiating projects which were not truly commercial-oriented or using the PPP
        schemes as a cover to get excessive loans from banks. To prevent debt risk and misuse of fiscal funds, the
        central government has toughened regulations to reduce fiscal and financial risk for both the public and private
        sectors. There are new policies regarding the participation of local governments and central SOEs in PPP
        infrastructure projects. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance has started to evaluate existing PPP infrastructure
        projects to help clarify the scope of the PPP projects and reject any ¡°fake¡± ones that offer no real commercial
        value once the projects are complete and put into use. The evaluation will last until the end of Q1 2018, which
        will delay existing PPP project starts and also constrain new PPP project additions in the short term. We expect
        PPP infrastructure investment to remain subdued in the short term but we expect the growth to pick up in
        2H18.<br/><br/>
        Overseas expansion might help offset the slowdown in some domestic business growth. Given growth deceleration in
        the domestic market, we expect the central government to push the Belt and Road Initiative even harder and
        provide more help for domestic construction companies¡¯ overseas expansion. Infrastructure investment in emerging
        markets in Belt and Road countries should also see further growth acceleration. Asia is the main destination for
        China¡¯s investment in Belt and Road infrastructure. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) report on infrastructure
        development in developing Asian countries projects that total investment needs for transport, power,
        telecommunications, water supply and sanitation (climate-adjusted estimates) are US$26tn in 2016- 2030, or
        US$1.7tn p.a., which is more than double the investment it estimated for the period 2010- 2020. The ADB plans to
        work more closely with the China-backed Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to provide financing for more
        projects in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Central SOE construction companies to benefit from the more stringent environmental regulations. The
        construction sector underperformed the whole market in 2017. We believe there should be no further downside
        risks to the share price in the near term with a PER of 6-8x. Any signs of infrastructure investment exceeding
        market expectations should improve market sentiment and drive a share price rerating. CCC is our top pick in the
        sector. We believe there should be limited downside risk to its share price, as current price largely reflects
        market expectations about the financial deleveraging impact on its business growth. We believe CCC, as the
        industry leader, should benefit from the more stringent environment for PPP infrastructure investment.</p>
