    <p> National cement prices continued to drop last week. The average cement price(nationwide) decreased 1.5% week on
        week to RMB406/tonne last week. The regionswith a decline of RMB30-80/tonne were mainly high cement price
        regions, including eastand central China. In certain regions in Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan, cement
        pricesincreased by RMB20-30/tonne. Demand weakened compared with the previous weekdue to lower demand in rural
        areas. Demand from real estate and key constructionprojects remained strong due to tight construction schedules,
        while construction of somesmaller projects began gradual suspensions before Chinese New Year. In regions
        apartfrom Guangdong and Guangxi, cement shipments started to decline to about 80% to 90%of normal production. As
        CNY is approaching, cement demand will continue to fallgradually, and cement prices are likely to maintain a
        moderate downtrend. The averageinventory level (nationwide) rebounded slightly to 53.88%.<br/><br/>
        Coal prices were stable last week. The comprehensive average price index for Bohai-Rim Steam Coal (Q5500K)
        remained at RMB578/tonne last week. The index was down2.2% on a year-on-year basis.<br/><br/>
        Planned production suspension to maintain demand-supply balance. Since Q1 is alow season because of CNY, some
        provinces have already planned productionsuspension to avoid accumulation of inventory. For instance, cement
        companies inJiangsu plan a suspension of 30 days during CNY. Zhejiang and Yunnan also planproduction suspensions
        of 35 days and 35-45 days, respectively, in Q1 2018. We expectto see more provinces announce production
        suspension plans soon. If these plans areexecuted effectively, they should prevent a sharp fall in cement
        prices.<br/><br/>
