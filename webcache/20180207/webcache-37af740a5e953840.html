    <p> In 2017, the electronics sector maintained steady growth and a high degree ofprosperity. Driven by new
        technologies and industrial revival, the electronicssector was on the rise outperforming the average A-share
        market performance.<br/><br/>
        In 2018 we expect the semiconductor segment to continue with medium tolong term investment opportunities.
        Besides, we also recommend downstreamsegments based on AI chip technology including areas of security,
        consumerelectronics, automatic driving, etc. Additionally, we think automotiveelectronics might follow 3C to
        become the next big driving force of theelectronics industry.<br/><br/>
        Gartner¡¯s forecast suggests that global investment in the semiconductorindustry will maintain sustained growth
        in 2017-2019. The driving force of thedownstream semiconductor demand might be shifted from the 3C products
        tothe automotive electronics, Internet of Things and other directions. Currently,China¡¯s IC self-sufficiency
        rate was only 30% and relies heavily on ICimportation. In light of strong policy support and the high prosperity
        of globalsemiconductor industry, we remain positive on domestic substitution; selfdeveloped,designed and tested
        chips have great future potential.<br/><br/>
        Artificial intelligence is currently the most important technological and socialchange. As the artificial
        intelligence technology represented by AlphaGodeveloped by leaps and bounds, and with the increasingly fierce
        competitionfor AI experts, we forecast the next ten years will witness the coming of the AIera. Technology
        giants worldwide are making strategic moves for AI chips,hoping to step in the forefront in the era of
        technological revolution. Investorscan select individual stocks belonging to the downstream segments of the
        AIchip industry such as security, auto-driving and consumer electronics.<br/><br/>
        Growth momentum was rooted in two aspects: 1) the overall development ofthe automotive market and improvement of
        automotive electronics; 2) thebooming of new energy vehicles drives the demand for automotive
        electronics.<br/><br/>
        With the steady growth of automobile sales, especially the rapid developmentof new energy vehicles and the
        advancement of automobile technology andelectronics, we maintain that automotive electronics will become the
        newgrowth driver and the next major driver of the electronics industry.</p>
