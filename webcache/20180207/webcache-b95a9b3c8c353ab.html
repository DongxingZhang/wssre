    <p> Last week the Shanghai Composite increased 2.01% to close at 3558.13 points, the Shenzhen Composite gained 2.32%
        to close at 11557.82 points. ChiNext closed at 1816.80 points with a growth of 5.13%. The CSI 300 gained 2.24%
        to close at 4381.30 points. Last week China¡¯s central bank realized a net return of CNY320 billion, indicating
        relatively stable liquidity of china¡¯s financial system. In terms of foreign exchange, the continuous gain of
        CNY during the past week have more or less affected the import and export trade, and might further raise the
        funds outstanding for foreign exchange. As far as interest rates are concerned, both short- and long-term rates
        have slightly dropped as the overall interest rate bond curve has seen downward translation. In terms of A-share
        market, the risk appetite is likely to pick up with expectation for marginal improvement of liquidity. The
        earnings of A-share companies tend to maintain current level and low valuation and stable profitability continue
        to be the main rationale for stock selection. Besides, the normalization of IPO and strengthened financial
        regulations might negatively influence stock valuations. In this sense, we continue to recommend laggard blue
        chips that may catch up with the broad market and well-performing SMEs.<br/><br/>
        Last week, driven by the cement stocks the sector gained 3.4%. The recently released 2017 earnings forecasts
        reveal performances that exceed expectation. Underpinned by expectations for strong profitability, cement stocks
        rebounded. With the coming of the Spring Festival, the downside trend of spot prices is likely to reach an end.
        Additionally, the current inventory of cement and glass nationwide stays at a low level. That said, there is
        likelihood for price hike in the short term. High safety margin and rebound of spot prices make the rationale
        for investment opportunities in the spring. Recommended stocks are: ACC (600585.SH), WANNIANQING (000789.SZ) and
        KIBING (601636.SH).</p>
