    <p> Over the past month, global bond yields have continued to move higher, with theyield on US 10-year Treasury
        bills (possibly the most important price in thefinancial universe) finally breaching the 2016 high of 2.64%.
        While yields havesubsequently retreated a little, the risk has increased that they now movetowards 3% - the top
        of the range seen over recent years.<br/><br/>
        We became more positive on the REITs in July last year upgrading WFD, VCX,SCG, GPT and DXS. Encouragingly, the
        REITs returned 11.2% through to 31December, well ahead of the broader market (+7.7%) i.e. 350bps
        ofoutperformance. This was supercharged by the WFD bid into year-end asexpected. The retail REIT thesis was
        predicated on: i) the top five malls for eachREIT are typically 37-73% of capital diluting the impact from
        portfolio tails;ii) when the sector is back at NTA we believe the market is underappreciatingpotential for
        alternate use; and iii) strong pricing for quality assets. Whilst thisdeal never printed, we have seen very
        strong pricing for direct asset transactionsin the past six months. With the January bond led sell-off reopening
        some ofthese value opportunities, we maintain our positive sector call.<br/><br/>
        After resurgent strength in commodity prices over the past three months, weupgrade our commodity and equity
        earnings forecasts. The biggest change is alift in investor sentiment towards global and Chinese demand in 2018.
        Weupgrade near-term forecasts to reflect these events and expect consensusupgrades to support the stocks during
        upcoming results season. Further out,many of our key theses, such as downside to bulks on falling Chinese
        steeldemand, are intact.<br/><br/>
        Airlines¡¯ forward schedule matters. In our last three editions of Follow the seats,we were spot on for 22 out of
        the 28 travel trends for China tourism; five were atleast in the same direction; and only one (for
        China-Thailand) was vastlydifferent, due to a larger-than-expected contraction in China-Korea seats.</p>
