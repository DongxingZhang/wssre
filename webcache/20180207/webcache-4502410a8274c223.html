    <p> Business models that focus on quality content could bring about amazing profitability. The success of Cheetah,
        Netflix, Nintendo, and Mango TV reveal how sound quality makes good profitability. With increasing quality
        content in 2018, China¡¯s media companies will no longer rely on overseas content. By exploring user preference
        and creating exclusive content, major companies could step up in the game.<br/><br/>
        In the coming years, Games, TV shows, films and literature are likely to see continuous content upgrade, and we
        are optimistic about investment opportunities generated by high-quality content that appeals to increasing
        paying users and earnings. In 2018, medium to large game producers will maintain high endogenous growth by
        seizing market shares of smaller companies. According to Apple¡¯s bestseller rank, we think there will be a shift
        of popularity from computer to mobile games. New media and traditional television have strong demand for premium
        content. Industry leaders with advantages in brand and financing are more likely to increase market shares and
        competitiveness, with performance expected to exceed the industry average. As for the film industry, we think
        future opportunities also rest upon constant upgrade of content materials.<br/><br/>
        The growth potential of China¡¯s media industry resides within the industry itself. Generally speaking, we think
        highly of the essentiality of quality content in customer acquisition and retention, and it is going to be the
        driver for future growth of the media industry. Since the internet has played an increasingly important role in
        channeling media resources, we believe the ability to generate quality content and cooperate fully with channels
        will help media names to get ahead.<br/><br/>

        (300133.SZ), Ciwen Media (002343.SZ), Thinkingdom Media (603096.SH), Perfect World (002624.SZ) and Sanqi
