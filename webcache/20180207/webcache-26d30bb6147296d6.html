    <p> M&amp;A; likely to pick up in 1H18 following relatively dormant 2H17<br/><br/>
        Despite an oil price north of $60/bbl, we anticipate that the majority of ourcoverage stands firm (for the most
        part) on their 2018 capital outlook basedon a $50-$55/bbl environment. That having been said, we note some
        operators(EOG/MRO) projecting to generate FCF ($1.2bn/$600mm at DB deck $56/$62 WTI/Brent), have healthy balance
        sheets (ND/Cap &lt;20% PF18), and a comparitive needfor increasing Permian inventory depth. With 6 asset
        packages currently beingmarketed in the Permian Delaware (including BHP's 100k net acre position), wesee M&amp;A;
        likely increasing in 1H18 vs. a more measured transaction value paceseen in 2H17 ($17bn in total value, down 66%
        vs. 1H17).<br/><br/>
        With ~$4bn of incremental cash flow at $60/$65, acreage pickups more likely<br/><br/>
        While upstream operators have stressed capital discipline over the last couplemonths, an oil strip &gt;$60/bbl
        provides a bit more flexibility for operators,particularly those with healthy balance sheets and who were
        already projectedto be generating FCF in our base case ($56/$62 WTI/Brent). Relative to peeraverages of ~22/17
        years of Permian/onshore US shale inventory depth, MRO andEOG offer 21/9 and 5/13, respectively. Both operators
        project to be FCF positive(~$600mm/$1.2bn), and maintain healthy balance sheets (~19%/17% ND/Cap)relative to
        peers (~31% avg). We count 6 Permian Delaware packages currentlyon the market, with BHP's ~100k net acre
        position being far and away the largest.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and Risks<br/><br/>
        Companies in our integrated/large-cap space are valued on either a EV/DACFmultiple (CVX.N, XOM.N, COP.N, and
        OXY.N or on a blended NAV, EV/DACFmultiple methodology. NAVs assume $65/bbl, $57/bbl, and $3.25/mcf for
        Brent,WTI and Henry Hub pricing resp. Primary downside risks include a decline inglobal oil demand and a
        decrease in the underlying commodity. Upside risksinclude increased demand and increased operator
        efficiency.<br/><br/>
        2H17 M&amp;A; activity volume steady, aggregate value ($13bn) dips by 66% vs.1H17<br/><br/>
        Aggregate M&amp;A; activity totaled just $13bn combined in 2H17, relative to a $21bn/$17bn total for 1Q17 and
        2Q17, respectively despite the number of deals (18/19in 3Q/4Q) remaining consistent (20/16 in 1Q/2Q). As oil
        prices reached a relativebottom in the low $40s in 3Q and investor bases clamored for increased
        capitaldiscipline and shareholder return. Larger, public operators continue to exit majoroil basins
        (Bakken/Eagle Ford) yielding the properties increasingly to smaller,private investors. A robust quarter of
        Marcellus focused activity in 2Q17 came toa halt as natural gas focused transactions totaled just ~$400mm in
        2H17, vs. &gt;$10bn in 2Q17 (largely driven by EQT-RICE and NBL asset sale).</p>
