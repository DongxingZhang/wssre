    <p> 1) Stronger-than-expected IA demand: China's overall IA demand, despitetougher comps, further accelerated to 17%
        YoY in 4Q17 (vs. +15% YoY in 3Q and11-12% in 1H), pointing to potential upside for HOLI's PA segment.<br/><br/>
        2) Encouraging progress in FA: Leveraging on HOLI's superior data acquisition/integration capabilities and
        accumulated database/experience for variousverticals, we expect HOLI to launch a monetizable flagship product
        soon.<br/><br/>
        3) Positive mix change in EMU procurement: We expect EMU deliveries this yearto be largely for the 350km/h CEMU
        model. ATP pricing for this model is 2x thatof the 250km/h model, which accounted for almost all the EMUs
        procured anddelivered in HOLI's FY17.<br/><br/>
        Our FY18 earnings forecast of USD110 (non-GAAP NP) is already at the highend of management's guidance and tops
        the Street, but given the above positivedevelopments, we see further upside potential. Along with the FA
        breakthroughand considering the better outlook for FA (vs. PA), we expect HOLI's valuationdiscount to global IA
        peers to narrow. We raise our TP to USD30.</p>
