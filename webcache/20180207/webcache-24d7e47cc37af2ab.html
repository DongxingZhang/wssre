        Because of the implementation of favorable policies for purchase of small-displacement vehicles, the demand for
        passenger vehicles have narrowed. There may be a zero growth in 2018. However, SUV sales maintained a growth
        rate of more than 15%, expanding market shares. With the rising trend for electric cars, new energy vehicles
        sales are expected to improve next year. Tightened shipping policy resulted in remarkable heavy truck sales in

        not to mention the cost of the new energy car is only 30% of that of a conventional car. The traditional
        automobile market is being challenged and the penetration rate of new energy vehicles will continue to
        enlarge.<br/><br/>

        industrial chain is that those enterprises have strong certainty in the order. CATL has gradually developed into
        a leading name in battery, and built connection with a number of OEMs. In 2018 with the release of new auto
