    <p> Top-line beat; K12growth is all we care; another strong quarter<br/><br/>
        TAL and EDU have reported their quarterly Sept.-Nov. 2017results. The toplineof both TAL and EDU beat consensus
        estimates. K12, the mainrevenue/profit contributor, maintained the strong growth seen in the previousquarter
        (U-can +45%; Pop Kids + 51%; and Peiyou + 52%). Deferred revenue ofTAL rose 49% while that of EDU increased 58%,
        suggesting the revenuegrowth outlook for the next winter and spring seasons should also be strong.Overall,
        investors are positive on growth delivered by the two companies.<br/><br/>
        Guidance: accelerated or decelerated for next quarter?<br/><br/>
        From a forward-looking perspective, EDU¡¯s top-line growth guidance is stillaccelerating at 35-38% (in USD terms)
        for 3Q (2Q growth was 36.9%).Management believes 35-38% is not aggressive and has the confidence todeliver at
        the high end of the guidance. On the other hand, TAL guided 50-52%for 4Q (3Q growth was 66%). This suggests
        growth deceleration in the nextquarter, but management explains it is mainly due to impact from a lateChinese
        New Year (1-2weeks). If 1-2weeks of revenue is added to 4Q18,management believes the growth rate should
        accelerate.<br/><br/>
        Margin, growth and capacity, triangle puzzle<br/><br/>
        We analyze the relationship between top-line, capacity and OP margin. Webelieve OP margin is related to the
        speed of expansion/penetration in China,which helps to boost growth. Therefore, it is inevitable for margin to
        decline ifcapacity expansion is overly aggressive. We observe margin has a correlationwith the difference
        between revenue and capacity growth (figures 7-8). If thedifference between revenue/capacity growth starts to
        accelerate (revenuegrowth outperforms capacity growth to a certain point), we believe marginwould also improve.
        Similarly, if capacity growth accelerates and it fails topass through to revenue growth, margin would likely
        decline. As such, we donot worry about a short-term margin decline as long as top-line growthremains
        strong.<br/><br/>
        Valuation/Risk<br/><br/>
        We have Buy ratings on EDU (New Oriental) (target price USD115) and TAL(target price USD36). EDU and TAL are
        leaders in the K12tutoring market butthey account for a less-than-4% market share in total. We expect them to
        growshare robustly, and believe they will penetrate into lower tier cities to increasetheir total market share.
        Our valuation is based on DCF, because K12-tutoringis a strong cash flow business with visible and stable
        growth. Risks include: 1)change of policy; 2) disease outbreak; and 3) aggressive network expansion.</p>
