    <p> Benefited from the supply-side reform and reinforced environmental protection, the paper-making industry
        concentration improved. Since waste importation was restricted, in 1H17 the prices of domestic waste products
        roared, which has been transmitted to the downstream paper products. The profitability of leading paper-making
        enterprises increased significantly. In 2017 the customized household industry saw many new names and the
        overall performance remained strong.<br/><br/>
        The supply side reform is expected to continue. With advantages in channels and technologies, leading
        enterprises will rapidly increase their market share as the industry clears out excessive output. With
        centralization of downstream demand, packaging and printing leaders could benefit from enhanced bargaining
        power. Driven by consumption upgrade, brand-building household enterprises will enjoy rapid growth.<br/><br/>
        Aspects that affect the paper-making industry include the supply-side reform and reinforced environmental
        protection. Imported waste paper standards will stay at a high level and domestic waste price is likely to pick
        up. While supply-side reform accelerates, leading enterprises will expand their production simultaneously. The
        industry will present a tighter balance between supply and demand. Related names are Shanying International
        Holdings Co., Ltd. (600567) and C&amp;S; Paper Co., Ltd. (002511).<br/><br/>
        Impacted by rising material costs, in 2017 the packaging and printing industry had limited profitability and
        sluggish performance. Many small and medium-sized companies were eliminated, resulting in expanded market share,
        enhanced bargaining power and cost-shifting ability for leading companies. Those companies could improve
        earnings by gradually transforming into integrated packaging service providers and increasing the added value of
        their products. Recommended name is Shenzhen Yuto Packaging Technology (002831).</p>
