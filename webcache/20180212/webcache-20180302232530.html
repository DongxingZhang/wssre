    <p> Inflation came in at 3.25% yoy in January 2018, softer than the pace we expected at 3.50%(Bloomberg Consensus:
        3.33%). Core inflation also came in slower than expected at 2.69% yoyagainst consensus expectation of 2.80%
        (UOBI forecast: 2.95%). Food inflation accelerated to2.95% yoy from 1.26% previously as demand remains
        relatively strong for food items whilehousing inflation decelerated to 4.24% yoy in January vis-¨¤-vis December¡¯s
        5.14%, which waslikely a reflection of softer rental markets. Additionally, transport prices also fell markedly
        to 1.50%in light of falling air and train costs from 4.23% previously. The accelerated inflation in foodprices
        was also reflected by the hastening pace of volatile inflation that registered 2.62% yoy inJanuary from a mere
        0.71% in December (2017 average was at 1.82%). Overall, deceleration oftransport and housing inflation outweighs
        gains in the pace of food inflation, rendering headlineinflation lower than our expectation and also from
        December¡¯s 3.61%.<br/><br/>
        Inflation remains within Bank Indonesia¡¯s (BI) inflation target of 2.5-4.5%, slightly below itsmidpoint.
        However, we believe given the upcoming festivities in H1 2018 as well as for regionalelections, demand may
        improve and inflation creep higher. We keep our inflation forecast of 4.2%for 2018 and for BI to remain neutral
        for H1 2018 at 4.25% (BI Rate: 7-Day Repo Rate).</p>
