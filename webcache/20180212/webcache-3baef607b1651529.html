    <p> The coal prices stayed at a relatively high level in 2017, the decrease in thermalpower profitability had led to
        the overall decline of the power industry,underperforming CSI 300 by 28.41%. In 1-10M2017, the whole
        societyconsumed electricity of 5201.8 billion kWh, an increase of 6.69%YoY; theinstalled capacity nationwide
        increased 7.33%YoY, with the overall growthrate down 3.48%YoY. With the slowdown of new capacity installation
        and therebound of whole society power consumption, we think 2018 may seeimproved supply-demand pattern and
        revival of industrial prosperity.<br/><br/>
        While high coal prices in 2017 undermined the sector profits, it also triggeredthe coal-electricity linkage
        mechanism. If coal and electricity linkage starts, weestimate the average thermal power price could improve by
        10.34%. Thermalpower companies are expected to embrace growing profitability, specificallyHDPI (600027.SH) and
        HPI (600011.SH) are worth attention. If coal-powerlinkage does not start, given the existing units, ZHEJIANG
        ENERGY ELECTRICPOWER(600023.SH) has a higher safety margin.<br/><br/>
        In 2017 NRDC and NEA issued policies measures aimed at the issue ofhydropower curtailment. With the ongoing
        trend for the marketization ofpower pricing, the hydropower generation is likely to pick up with the problemof
        curtailment alleviated. Currently the hydropower on-grid price remains thelowest among all power sources. As the
        thermal power prices are on the upsidetrend, it could underpin the hydropower on-grid price. During the ¡°13th
        fiveyearplan¡±, growth of new hydropower generating units tend to slow down, andcosts for new hydropower projects
        might also narrow. Companies are likely tomaintain a relatively high level of dividends.<br/><br/>
        In 2017, the market size of the power industry nationwide will reach 2 trillionkWh. Reform of electricity
        distribution will lead to new profit model: a shiftfrom simply selling electricity to a ¡°sales + service¡± model.
        The sales companystarted to integrate upstream generation with power transmission anddistribution. Companies
        with an edge in users and sources are more likely toshine. We are upbeat about companies that combine power
        generating,distribution and selling businesses altogether.</p>
