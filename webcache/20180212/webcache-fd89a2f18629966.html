    <p> Mexico¡¯s Central Bank is scheduled to meet Thursday for the first time in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Since December¡¯s meeting and until last week, inflation risks in Mexico haddeclined. In particular, January¡¯s
        Banxico Survey of Expectations released lastweek suggested the 25bp hike last December was followed by a
        marginal shiftof medium and long term inflation expectations towards the central bank¡¯s 3%target. In particular,
        while inflation expectations for 2018 and 2019 stand ataround 4% and 3.5% respectively, respondents expect core
        inflation at year-endto reach 3.6% and 3.3% in 2018 and 2019. Also, prices during year¡¯s first twoweeks dropped
        to 5.5% from the previous 6.85% print. Finally, with the USD/MXN ending last week at around 18.4 it seemed to us
        that the improved balanceof risks warranted Banxico remaining on hold in February to perhaps match theFed¡¯s
        expected hike next March with an increase of rates in their April meetingalthough we recognized our call had
        significant risks to the upside (see EM Macroand Strategy Focus).<br/><br/>
        Over the past few days, against a backdrop of heightened volatility in US equitymarkets and financial markets
        more generally the MXN has lost around 2.2% ofvalue against the USD. The Mexican economy¡¯s low pass-through
        implies thatthe selloff does not materially threaten the improvement of the balance of risks toinflation,
        Banxico¡¯s past behavior lead us to believe that the likelihood of Banxicodelivering a 25bp hike next meeting
        have increased significantly. And in our view,Banxico¡¯s particular sensitivity to the MXN¡¯s price action and the
        continuingturmoil will lead Mexico¡¯s central bank to hike this time (especially after the 0.5%MXN selloff in the
        last hour of trading of the US equity market). Unless thereis a very large surprise to the downside when INEGI
        releases January¡¯s inflation(consensus: 5.52% y/y, DB: 5.5% y/y) could sway Banxico¡¯s board to keep the rateat
        7.25% we think the likelihood Banxico stays on hold is now very small.</p>
