    <p> CPI linker income of state banks to increase further in 1Q18; private banks are likely to see a major retreat
        qoq, due to their lower implied CPI assumptions .<br/><br/>
        Following the announcement of January inflation (9.9% yoy), we are now able to calculate the inflation index for
        1Q18 (Nov¡¯17-Jan¡¯18) that will be subjected to the revaluation of CPI linkers. Accordingly, underlying CPI
        inflation came in at 3.2% in 1Q18 (4Q17: 3.3%; 3Q17: 0.3%) implying that linker yields evolved at 13.1% in 1Q18
        from 14.6% in 4Q17 (1Q17: 14.3%). We estimate that Halkbank¡¯s and Vakifbank¡¯s (which revalue their CPI bonds on
        a quarterly basis with the actual CPI inflation) interest revenues from linkers would evolve close to 4Q17
        levels - assuming 4Q volumes sustain and leaving all else unchanged. Conversely, we expect private banks (that
        use either their own CPI forecasts or CBT¡¯s expectation survey) to generate weaker income from linkers despite
        owning a greater volume of CPI-linked bonds (4Q17: +7% qoq). It should be noted, however, that banks constructed
        their budget targets under an optimistic scenario once again (2018E: 9.0%) and a positive surprise to NIM
        guidance is likely with a potential 1ppt deviation of CPI inflation from the base lifting our NIMs by c.5bps
        (ceteris paribus).<br/><br/>
        2018E: As base effects on inflation turn positive next year, we see linker yields decline yoy, putting
        additional pressure on margins that are already challenged by volatility in TR assets and likely higher FX
        funding costs .<br/><br/>
        In 2017, when upswing in deposit rates and liability sensitive natures weigh negatively on loan spreads, greater
        exposure to linkers (share in TRY-denom. securities book increased to c.46%) and inflation climbing to 11.9%,
        helped banks largely offset the pressure at the NIM level. In 2018, we believe income from linkers will be less
        supportive of top line revenues, as base effects on inflation turns positive from December 2017 onwards, which
        could lead to some disinflation processes (until April¡¯18) this year (2018E: 9.3%). On these grounds, we
        estimate CPI linker incomes will likely decline 13% yoy, as yields fall to 11.9% (2017E: 14.6%). This should
        reduce the share of linkers in interest income to 6.5% in 2018 (2017E: 8.5%), adding to the existing challenges
        to our NIM estimate that is already threatened by sustained volatility in TRY assets.</p>
