    <p> Scope for dividend hike moderates as recurring income growth slows down.<br/><br/>
        As in previous results seasons, Hang Lung Properties kick-started the resultsseason for Hong Kong property
        companies, on Jan 30. In general, we expect tosee little excitement in the upcoming results season, as
        stronger-than-expectedASPs achieved in primary projects sold in FY17 will not be reflected until FY18.<br/><br/>
        Moreover, as the dividend hike has generally outpaced growth in thecorresponding recurring income over the past
        few years, the sector payoutratio already reached a high 49% in FY16 and recurrent profit as a percentageto
        dividend fell to 108% (117% in FY14; 111% in FY15). Hence, we believe thiswill hinder the scope for further
        dividend hikes.<br/><br/>
        Expect core profit +7.6% YoY in FY17; driven by strong development sales.<br/><br/>
        Driven by strong performance in the primary market in terms of both salesvolume and ASP, we expect core earnings
        to grow 7.6% YoY on average inFY17, among the companies under our coverage that are set to report earningsin the
        coming month. In particular, we expect Kerry to report the strongest setof results, with core earnings growing
        by 55%, boosted by bookings of TheBloomsway and Mantin Heights. On the other hand, we anticipate Hysan Devand
        Wharf REIC to report the weakest results, with core net earnings growingby 0.9% and declining 1.6%,
        respectively. Meanwhile, we anticipate strongerearnings growth in FY18; we revise up our earnings estimate by 7%
        onaverage, by factoring in stronger-than-expected ASP achieved.<br/><br/>
        Expect positive rental reversion for office/neutral to marginal negative for retail.<br/><br/>
        In our view, the scope for rental reversion is still one of the key aspects towatch out for in the upcoming
        results season. For the office market, spotGrade-A office rents rose by 2.6% YoY in FY17 to about 20% above
        expiringrent under a typical three-year lease. Hence, we expect office landlords toregister positive rental
        reversion and corresponding revaluation gain in FY17.<br/><br/>
        On the other hand, spot prime retail rents continued to soften in FY17 (-0.5%YoY) to about 1% below expiring
        rent under a typical lease term, so that weexpect to see mostly neutral to marginal negative reversion for the
        year.<br/><br/>
        Dividend hike more likely for CKA/HLD/Wharf/MTRC in FY17.<br/><br/>
        As the key earnings growth driver in the upcoming results season is expectedto be boosted by strong development
        sales, we anticipate limited scope forfurther dividend hikes, on the back of slowing recurring income growth,
        whererecurrent profit as a percentage to dividend fell to 108% (117% in FY14; 111%in FY15); we believe this will
        hinder the scope for further dividend hike. Inparticular, we think CK Asset, Henderson Land, Wharf and MTRC have
        ahigher chance of a dividend hike in FY17. On the other hand, we think there isa 50% chance of Hysan, Kerry,
        SHKP and NWD raising their dividend payouts,while we expect dividends to stay flat for Hongkong Land and
        Sino-Land.<br/><br/>
        Lack of fundamental catalysts but we do not rule out a technical catch-up rally.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentally speaking, we see few near-term positive catalysts in HongKong property. However, given that
        absolute valuation is not stretched and thesector is a sizeable constituent in the Hang Seng Index, in view of
        itsunderperformance in recent months, we do not rule out a technical catch-uprally in the coming months, if
        overall market conditions remain favorable.<br/><br/>
        Risks: unexpected changes in government policy and the economy.</p>
