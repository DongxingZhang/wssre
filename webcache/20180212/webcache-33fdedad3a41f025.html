    <p> We recently met Medco team in Jakarta and in this note present key highlightsfrom our meeting as well as updated
        view on the bonds.<br/><br/>
        Bonds view ¨C 2025s have outperformed; Initiate with Sell<br/><br/>
        Medco bonds have outperformed other Indo HY bonds so far this year with2022s up ~1pt YTD while recently issued
        2025s are currently trading aroundreoffer price despite recent treasury sell-off. 2025s resilience certainly
        standsout compared to other longer dated Indo HY bonds which are down 1-3ptssince Medco¡¯s new issuance (3-4pts
        down YTD). Outperformance of longerdated 2025s is worth noting even compared to existing 2022s (on a
        spreadbasis). 2025s have tightened by 23bps (on a z-spd basis) since issuance while2022s are 8bps wider during
        the same timeframe. As a result, 2025s are nowjust ~20bps wider in z-spread for ~2.5years extra maturity. This
        looksexcessive to us. Comparatively, better rated (by Moodys) Indika 2022s and2024s trade at z-spread
        differential of ~30bps and similar rated Vedanta 2022sand 2024s trade at z-spread differential of ~45bps. Thus,
        we initiate on Medco2025s with Sell and relatively prefer the shorter dated 2022s (maintain Hold).Key upside
        risks include continued rally in oil price and successful deleveragingwhile key downside risks includes
        aggressive debt funded capex/investment anddelays in production ramp.</p>
