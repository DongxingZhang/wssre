    <p> ETF outflows continue<br/><br/>
        Amidst the broad based risk market volatility, EPFR reported small inflows ofUSD20mm from EMD funds for the week
        ending 7th of February. However, hardcurrency funds had significant outflows of USD1.3bn (0.6% of AUM), while
        localcurrency and blended currency funds had inflows that more than offset the lossfrom hard currency funds.
        Outflows from hard currency funds have been mostlycontributed by ETFs, which had outflows of USD1.1bn (or 3.24%
        of total hardcurrency ETF assets) during the week. Judging by the performances of the majorEM ETFs today, we
        should expect large daily outflows to be reported tomorrow.<br/><br/>
        As a historical reference, these ETFs lost USD2.5bn during the weeks followingthe US election in 2016but that
        amount constituted a much larger portion of thetotal assets then (about 10% of AUM). We see ample scope for
        these ETFs to bleedat this point given the unsettled market sentiments. The total assets under theEM hard
        currency ETFs are about USD33.6bn, approximately 40% of which areallocated in the following countries (top 10,
        by order of size): Mexico, Indonesia,Turkey, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Philippines, China, Colombia, and
        Kazakhstan,based on our estimates.</p>
