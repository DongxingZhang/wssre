    <p> This will likely be another light week in terms of economic data releases. The monthly real GDPproxy for August
        and mid-month October inflation should be the main highlights. On the politicalfront, congress is likely to
        continue analysing the prosecutorial request to investigate thepresident.¡£<br/><br/>
        On Wednesday, we expect to see a slightly positive print (0.1% m/m) in monthly real GDPgrowth for August,
        following broad retail sales. The central bank¡¯s monthly real GDP proxy isdesigned to replicate the official GDP
        calculation, but on a monthly basis, and it was fairlyaccurate in its forecast of GDP for the first quarters of
        2017. Brazil¡¯s economy proved to bepositive in Q1and Q2, and we believe this trend will continue. We forecast
        growth at 3.0% in2018, from 1.0% in 2017.</p>
