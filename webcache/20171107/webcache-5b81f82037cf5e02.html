    <p> Spreads in China IG universe ¨C especially those equalised with the sovereignratings - have been grinding tighter
        insatiably for the past several weeks. In ourview, this was predominantly driven by expectations of a sovereign
        deal (asMoF had announced in May about issuance of USD2 billion bonds in 2H17).<br/><br/>
        Then last week, MoF announced that it will sell USD1 billion each of 5-yearand 10-year bonds soon. Based on our
        conversations with investors globally,client positioning has already become very heavy in China IG space,
        especiallyin quasi-sovereign credits with 100% state ownership, in an expectation of thesovereign bond taking
        the whole China IG universe tighter. This of course isbased on the assumption that the sovereign bond itself
        would print at quitetight valuations. We collated two charts (below) consisting of global EM andDM sovereign
        bonds of 5Y and 10Y duration and rated between A- and AAAand compared them against one another on T-spread and
        YTW basis. Wehighlight in red circles those areas where we believe China sovereign bondswould appear as viable
        comps. According to these comparisons, T+35-40bpand T+40-50bp look as realistic levels for China 5Y and 10Y
        bondsrespectively, purely on a relative basis. We think the 5Y10Y curve will be quiteflat.</p>
