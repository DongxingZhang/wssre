        3Q17results boosted by higher output, investment income and cost savings<br/><br/>
        In 3Q17, net profit was up by 11% yoy to Rmb9.7bn driven by 4% yoy increase innet output, a 87% yoy increase in
        investment income and a 11%/19% yoy drop infinancial/operational cost. Power generation growth recovered from a
        4% declinein the first half to 4% yoy in 3Q17thanks to improving water flows in Three Gorges(output +6% yoy) and
        Gezhouba (output +11% yoy). While Chuanyun (Xiluoduand Xiangjiaba)¡¯s power output growth remains stable with 1%
        improvement in3Q17.<br/><br/>
        As a result, 9M17net profit was up 9% yoy to Rmb17.8bn. The 1% yoy decreasein net power output was well offset
        by 12%/24% yoy decrease in financial/operational cost and doubled investment income. 9M17results accounts for
        90%of our previous full year estimates, ahead of the historical range of 79-83%.<br/><br/>
        Further room for financial cost savings<br/><br/>
        In 9M17, Yangtze's financial cost was lowered by 12% yoy to Rmb4.4bn withstable net gearing at 110%. Effective
        interest rate was lowered by 0.3ppt to 4.4%per our calculation. During the 1H17results conference call held in
        September,mgmt expects the debt to asset ratio to decrease gradually from 59% to 30%, afterwhich Yangtze may
        consider M&amp;A; and raise the debt to asset ratio again. We seefurther room for financial cost savings going
        forward as a result of deleveraging.<br/><br/>
        Hydro VAT rebate could be extended, positive to Yangtze<br/><br/>
        According to Energy News on 8Sep, the NDRC is soliciting feedbacks for thenotice of Reduce the Tax for
        Enterprises in Renewables Energy Sector. In thenotice, the NDRC proposes to reduce the VAT for hydro power units
        (with capacityabove 50MW) from 17% to 13% and to extend the VAT rebate period to 2020for those with capacity
        above 1GW. If passed, Yangtze Power would be the keybeneficiary and we estimate the extended VAT rebate would
        bring 9.6%/9.4%2018/19E earnings upside. See report Hydro VAT rebate could be extended,positive to Yangtze Power
        and SDIC, 8th Sep 2017for more details.</p>
