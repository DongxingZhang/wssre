    <p> OP numbers in line but FX losses。<br/><br/>
        Fuyao released 3Q17results after market close on Wednesday. NPAT slightlydecreased 1% YoY to RMB2.14bn in 9M17,
        representing only 67% and 66% ofDB's whole year estimate and Bloomberg consensus, respectively, mainly due toFX
        losses of RMB300m+ in 9M17as a result of RMB appreciation against theUSD. If we strip out FX losses, Fuyao¨s
        bottom line actually increased 24% YoYin 9M17, in line with our estimate (please refer to table
        below).。<br/><br/>

        Initiating on Fuyao-A with a Hold; risks。<br/><br/>
        With this report, we initiate coverage of Fuyao A shares (600660.SS) with a Holdand a target price of RMB23. The
        valuation is derived from the currency translationof our H-share target price, which is set using DCF
        methodology, with a WACC of7.1% (cost of equity at 8.4%, risk-free rate at 3.9%, market risk premium of
        5.6%,beta of 0.8) and terminal growth of 0%. The stock is trading at 21.6x 2017DBeEPS with 2017-19DBe EPS CAGR
        of 12%. We believe the valuation is fair, andthus initiate with a Hold. Fuyao A is trading at 21.6x 2017DBe EPS
        with 2017-19DBe EPS CAGR of 12%. A share peers are trading at 23x 2017E EPS and 2017-19EPS CAGR of 17%. Also,
        Fuyao is an exclusive, leading auto glass player with 65%market share in China and over 20% globally, and we
        believe it has competitveedge. Risks: Fuyao may face challenges during its international expansion, suchas
        fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, etc.Also, automobile glass industry
        is competitive, thus there is pressure on Fuyao'smarket share if it cannot compete effectively. Other risks
        include: higher or lowerraw materials and fuel prices; changes to the incentives provided by the PRCgovernment
        could materially reduce Fuyao's profitability, e.g. a change in thepreferential income tax rate.。</p>
