    <p> In this issue we ask whether investment landscape has transited from disinflationto inflation and how similar
        current environment is to ¡®67 or ¡®87 regime changes.<br/><br/>
        The 1950s-60s was the ¡®Golden Age¡¯. It was a time of reconstruction and risingproductivity; low unemployment and
        subdued inflation. In the DMs, it was also aperiod of mass college enrolments, job security and declining
        inequalities. It ledto a secular bull equity market that lasted almost two decades. The first signsof trouble
        appeared in late ¡®60s and by ¡®70s, investors entered a differentworld. State activism destroyed the Bretton
        Woods monetary system and gavebirth to modern fiat currencies. The age of inflation was born. Through
        ¡®70s-80sand into ¡®90s, the investment landscape was dominated by inflationary concerns,causing negative
        correlation between rates and equities. Inflation was thebogeyman, with equity investors fearing harsh CB
        responses. Hence, fromlate ¡®60s until well into ¡®80s most equities were in secular bear market
        territory.<br/><br/>
        In 1990s, environment underwent a radical change. The backlash againststate activism led to free market
        philosophies. It inaugurated a world of rapidfinancialization; but it was also an age of persistently falling
        inflation and cost ofcapital. The global de-regulation of product, labour and capital markets hasintegrated
        massive supply of EM labour. But it also emptied DMs middle class,raised inequalities and unleashed policies
        that replaced stagnant incomes withassets and leverage. It gave birth to Greenspan ¡®put¡¯, focus on avoidance
        ofvolatilities &amp; provision of ample liquidity. The consensus that ¡®inflationary beast¡¯was contained morphed
        by the mid-2000s into a fear that deflation was thenew bogeyman; hence rates-equities correlation turned
        positive. Equities reliedon CBs risk suppression and containment of deflation via assets wealth
        impact.<br/><br/>
        Are we witnessing a regime change? Proponents argue that disinflationarypressures (due to inclusion of EMs
        labour and baby boomers) are behind us. Associeties bump against capacity constraints and embark on late-cycle
        stimulus,inflation will be back, possibly as bad as in 1967/68. While possible, this viewunderplays deflationary
        pressures from technology &amp; financialization.<br/><br/>
        Since the early 90s, technological changes and overcapacity have been forcingcorporates to consolidate and
        improve efficiency (~70% of the US industriestoday are much more dominant &amp; concentrated). Technologies have
        also beendissolving labour markets and reducing labour¡¯s pricing power. Strengthening ofcorporate and declining
        labour power are precluding tightening markets fromflowing into higher wages. We also doubt that a commodity
        shock (a la ¡®70s) islikely while today¡¯s much higher debt burden cannot absorb any rise in the costof capital.
        Thus, disinflation still remains the core secular theme; but one canhave interludes of inflationary break-outs,
        within a deflationary channel (here).<br/><br/>
        We have described 2018 as the year of decisions and consequences andalso the year when volatilities could return
        with vengeance (irrespective ofeconomic strengths, as markets are not economies). Today, G4+Swiss CBs arebloated
        with ~US$16 trillion of assets, providing limited ammunition to fightrenewed disinflation while making liquidity
        withdrawals very dangerous. Unlike¡®60s/70s or ¡®87, economies are also now far more driven by asset prices;
        henceprice discovery and volatility can easily destroy wealth impact and tip the worldback into disinflation. As
        in 1987, contagion between FX, bonds &amp; equities wouldsignal a turning point. Trigger? US$ weakness could
        easily turn from reflatingto deflating global economies via higher US import prices, more robust Fedresponse,
        disinflation in non-US economies and deflating asset prices. There arehard &amp; conflicting policy choices to
        be made, with chances of errors multiplying.</p>
