    <p> FY18¡¯s expansionary budget continues the themes of SME and elderlysupport via extension / enhancement of
        initiatives from the FY16-17 budgetscovering tax relief, wage credits, continuing education, selected
        healthcare,and housing. Foreign worker levy increases in the marine sector also getdeferred for another year
        (Keppel is our preferred play here). Longer term, thebudget sustains investment in IP and R&amp;D; initiatives
        to ensure Singapore¡¯scompetitiveness while Infrastructure remains a focus area as well, with S$20bset to be
        spent in FY18 (up from S$8.5b in 2011). This will cover areas likerail expansion, redevelopment (Jurong Lake,
        Punggol, Woodlands North),Changi T5 and other strategic projects (we like SATS as a play on T5).<br/><br/>
        Potential pitfalls avoided: A widely expected 2% GST increase will only beimplemented by FY21-FY25. An
        e-commerce tax was also announced, butlimited to services (and only by 2020) with goods not in scope. This
        mitigatestwo potential risks to personal consumption, which has re-emerged as a keydriver of GDP in the last
        three quarters. A 1% increase in the top marginalBuyer¡¯s Stamp Duty to 4% on residential property was the
        budget¡¯s mainnegative surprise to us, but our property team does not see it as overlyonerous; we keep City
        Developments and CapitaLand as top picks.<br/><br/>
        Positive read across for banks and construction. SMEs stand to benefitmost from tax and worker credits, which is
        positive for this exposure vis-a-visthe banks, on which we have a positive view (top pick: OCBC). The
        plannedexpansion of the government bond market is also an incremental positive forthe banks. The budget¡¯s
        highest spending growth is in the Transport sector(Fig 3) - driven by development expenditure ¨C which is a
        positive for mid-capconstruction names. On the other hand, we note the slight contraction in FY18overall Health
        spending (-2%), which had been a key growth area in FY14-17.<br/><br/>
        Positive on index earnings and valuation. The link between fiscal spendingand FSSTI¡¯s EPS is a bit loose. But we
        should also consider a strong NODX(Fig 6), improving retail sales that will not be buffeted by higher GST, and
        aS$ set for a potentially renewed appreciation path in 2018. All told, we seeconsensus¡¯ +14% EPS growth for 2018
        as well supported. Our bottom upEPS is 4% above consensus, so we expect the upgrade path that started inearly
        2017 to continue (Fig 7). FSSTI¡¯s PER sits close to its past average at13.7x, but we see a multiple of 14.4x as
        justified, closer to +1STD (Fig 8).</p>
