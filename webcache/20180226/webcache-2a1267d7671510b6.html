    <p> We are at the start of a paradigm shift from traditional platforms such as TV toonline. Network provider
        Ericsson expects mobile video, among all applicationcategories, will grow fastest in terms of traffic
        consumption (50% CAGR in 2016-22E, followed by 38% for social network). This is underscored by
        relentlessinvestment in the space, and the next move by iQiyi/Youku/Tencent Video toincrease exclusive content
        should have a profound impact on the sector. Weexpect quality TV drama studios and IP libraries to be the
        biggest beneficiaries.<br/><br/>
        In contrast to some mainstream views that long-tail content will benefit from theover-the-top (OTT) era, we are
        believers in the blockbuster strategy. Thisheavily-watched content is gaining share in the China media sector.
        The top 10TV dramas took 74% of viewership in 2017, up from 53%/64% in 2015/2016.<br/><br/>
        Princess Agents (³þÇÇ´«) episodes were viewed 47bn times in 2017, impressivegrowth vs The Legend of Chusen¡¯s (ÇàÔÆÖ¾)
        26bn views in 2016, and Legend ofMiYue¡¯s 15bn in 2015. For movies, the top 5 grossing films, led by Wolf
        WarriorII, took 27% of the box office in 2017, up from 19% in 2016.<br/><br/>
        In the OTT era, offering movies in formats that consumers can¡¯t get anywhereelse, such as the bigger-screen IMAX
        format with great picture quality andsurround-sound, is a good way to attract consumers, in our view. While we
        arewary of excessive theatre expansion in the medium term, we are relativelyconfident on long-term demand for
        premium format movies.</p>
