    <p> The global economic recovery has gathered pace over the past three months,with industrial production growth
        increasing to a boom-like 5?% (3m/3m saar).<br/><br/>
        While growth has been improving for 2 years, to us the past month has seen afundamental change in market
        psychology, as incrementally better news finallyfocused minds on the gradual reflation underway. While risks
        remain, we thinkhigher interest rates and increased volatility is a natural reflection of the betteroutlook for
        growth and inflation this change of sentiment brings, and isconsequently unlikely to derail the
        recovery.<br/><br/>
        The logic of ironclad laws is unassailable. They cannot be bypassed and mustbe obeyed. Apart from base effect,
        sectoral balances are among the fewcertainties in economics. All sectors (private, public &amp; external) must
        balance tozero. We are not convinced the Trump administration is thinking in sectoralterms, but they are among
        the most powerful forces driving economies and assetclasses. As the US unveiled budget and infrastructure plans,
        they had essentiallyguaranteed much higher and persistent public sector deficits and treasuryissuances. Although
        it is doubtful that either budget or infrastructure proposalswould survive in their current form, annual
        issuance could easily exceed US$1trillion pa through 2018-20 and most likely beyond.</p>
