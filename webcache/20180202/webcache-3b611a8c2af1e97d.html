    <p> Relative Value.<br/><br/>
        Alibaba 2057s (G+141bp offer) are attractive on the curve (Figure 1), trading20bp wider than the 2047s, against
        US peers that have just 10bp spread pickup on average for 30/40 curve (Figure 2). Alibaba also offers ~50bp pick
        up tothe 2055-57 bonds from the US tech names. Even within Asia, they look cheapto other long bonds (Figure 3).
        Meanwhile, the 5/10yr spread curve is alsosteep at 40-50bp, albeit this is the case for most recent issuers. We
        see around10bp tightening potential in the 2057s. Separately, the 30yr UST yields havebeen rising recently,
        ~18bp higher YTD, which should support spreads at thevery long end. Key downside risks are large acquisitions,
        negative headlinesaround SEC investigation, VIE structure, etc.<br/><br/>
        Technicals.<br/><br/>
        Technicals are struggling a bit as we write, with a couple of jumbo dealspricing almost back to back and some
        profit takers post significant tighteningsince new issue. However, technicals should improve again, partly from
        lack ofbond supply in the space as China tech companies have preferred accessingthe loan market in recent years.
        Plus, Alibaba is a rare 144A bond from aquality issuer in China IG and its 2057 is perhaps the only 40 year bond
        in Asia.<br/><br/>
        Baidu came to the market in 2H last year and we don¡¯t see any immediaterefinancing needs. JD has also just
        raised USD1 billion in syndicated loans andRCF. Only potential supply we see is from group company, ANT
        Financial (asreported by Bloomberg).<br/><br/>
        Fundamentals.<br/><br/>
        Alibaba¡¯s credit profile is underpinned by dominant market position, net cashbalance sheet, positive FCF
        generation, and continued momentum in revenues.<br/><br/>
        Leverage has been trending down to 1.0x and liquidity position is exceptionallystrong with net cash position of
        RMB76 billion at Sep quarter 2017. Please seeFigure 4 for key financials. To be clear, despite its solid
        fundamentals, webelieve the likelihood for a rating upgrade is low. Alibaba is now ratedA1/A+/A+ by Moody¡¯s/S&amp;P;/Fitch,
        same as the China sovereign. It might bedifficult for Alibaba which derives ~90% of its revenues/profit in China
        to berated higher than the sovereign</p>
