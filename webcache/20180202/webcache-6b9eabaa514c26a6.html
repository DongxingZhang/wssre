    <p> We have been meeting Asian based investors from mid December throughJanuary. Our enthusiasm has been difficult
        to transfer to skeptical investors. Everycompany we rate Buy features a counter-story, which creates a strong
        barrier toinvesting. Currently it seems like the negative stories are generally priced in, whilethe potential
        for a more positive story to emerge is discounted. For this reason,the sector is heavily under-owned, and
        interest especially light. It's usually onlythis difficult to broke telcos when they have been forming a strong
        base. We donote a thawing of resistance in January, as the sector's relative value has becomemore obvious. But
        investors appear reluctant to buy anything without a provablecatalyst, and preferably with a nearby date for the
        catalyst to be realized. Shouldnewsflow improve a buying squeeze should follow.<br/><br/>
        While marketing, our charts from the 2018 Outlook showing how sector relativevalue was at extreme levels
        generated attention, while our argument that sectorrevenue should pick up was fairly well received, with our
        argument being: 1) ITbudgets should expand now that animal spirits are getting unleashed after beingtight since
        the GFC; 2) Consumer spend on the sector should pick up as globalgrowth drives employment opportunities for
        young Asians - who like to spend ontelecoms - as occurred in the last growth cycle; 3) IoT, smart cities, etc
        can drive anew leg of growth; and 4) 4G and fibre capex cycling down through 2019 - drivinga strong FCF cycle.
        Investors were most interested in our views on China, Japanand India. Key feedback by market follows.</p>
