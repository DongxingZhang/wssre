    <p> FY17net profit +c.200% YoY, beating expectations<br/><br/>
        WHC released prelim FY17profit guidance with net profit growth of c.200% YoY.This beat DBe/ consensus estimates
        by 26% / 11%. The strong results were drivenby: 1) a stronger PU performance in both ASP and volume; 2) higher
        non-recurringprofit from government subsidies. Looking ahead, we expect strong 1Q18E on aYoY basis with: 1) a
        robust MDI spread due to tight supply-demand dynamics andhigh entry barriers; 2) strong performances from
        petrochemical and functionalmaterials. Therefore, we reiterate our Buy rating on the strong outlook ahead.
        Thebiggest risks would relate to potential restructuring / M&amp;A; with parentco assets.The stock is under
        suspension pending a restructuring announcement.<br/><br/>
        Strong PU / Functional material outlook<br/><br/>
        The robust MDI spread was driven by a domestic environmental scrutiny ledWHC polymeric MDI ASP rise of 92% yoy
        in 2017to RMB26,717/ton. Lookinginto 2018, we expect MDI average margin will continue to grow yoy due to alow
        base in 1H17; conversely, we expect the global supply demand balance willbe flat as the Sandra plant started
        operation in 3Q17to offset strong demandgrowth globally. For the polycarbonate (PC) segment, where China relies
        heavilyon imports, the outlook remains strong; WHC's new PC plant phase 1with 70ktpacapacity started on January
        23, making WHC the no#2PC producer in China witha total capacity of 200ktpa. We continue to expect functional
        material segment(including PC) revenue to achieve a 39% CAGR in 2018-20E.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We base our RMB47.5target price on 8.0x EV/EBITDA by using a GordonGrowth Model, which is at a 15% discount to
        its historical average of 9.4x.Before suspension, the stock was at 6.1x forward EV/EBITDA, representing a
        35%discount to the historical average. Key risks: 1) unexpected corporate actions,including restructuring and M&amp;A;
        2) unplanned maintenance turnarounds; 3)fluctuations in oil and chemical product prices; and 3)
        lower-than-expected GDPgrowth impacting demand growth.</p>
