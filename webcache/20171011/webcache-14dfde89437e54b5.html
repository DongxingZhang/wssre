    <p> 1H result largely inline; strong top-line partially offset by surging finance cost<br/><br/>
        Net profit rose 19% YoY to Rmb101m, on a 36% YoY top-line growth. 1H net profitachieved 19% of our full-year
        forecast (vs. 1H16: 21%), which was largely inline.Historically, FPI's earnings have been heavily skewed toward
        2H, especially in thefirst two years during a five-year-plan period. Strong top-line growth was partiallyoffset
        by surging finance cost (+174% YoY) as net gearing increased to 27% asof end-1H17from 9% as of end-2016likely
        due to investment associated withPPP projects. For 2Q alone, sales sustained a 36% YoY growth (vs. +34% YoY
        in1Q), while NP growth visibly moderated to 15% YoY (from 48% YoY in 1Q), largelydriven by a big jump in finance
        cost.1H17review by segment<br/><br/>
        Environmental monitoring system (EMS): Since 2H16, installation haswitnessed visible acceleration from the
        customer side, after a slow 1H16(down 2% YoY). In 1H17, sales growth further accelerated to 17% YoY,from 15% YoY
        in 2H16. According to management, initial feedback fromsales department suggests order flow for EMS was robust
        in 1H (30%+YoY), which means revenue recognition is likely to further accelerate in2H when installation is
        completed. This, along with the contribution fromHuangshan PPP projects (NP of Rmb40-50m guided by management)
        in2H, should drive a strong 2H for EMS segment.<br/><br/>
        Laboratory analysis equipment: Sales surged 103% YoY in 1H, mainlydriven by the consolidation of Anpel's
        accounts in 1H17. Addingback Anpel's revenue for 1H16, sales of laboratory analysis equipmentincreased 7% YoY on
        a like-for-like basis.<br/><br/>
        Highlights for other segments: Sales of industrial process analysiswere down 3% YoY in 1H, as downstream
        verticals are mainlytraditional heavy industries (mainly metallurgy, petrochemical, etc.).Water conservancy
        water intelligent system was up 16% YoY while otherbusiness (environment governance, etc.) were up 57% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Maintaining Buy; risks<br/><br/>
        We retain our estimates post 1H results. We keep our DCF-based target price ofRmb45(WACC: 8.5% and TGR: 2%)
        unchanged and maintain Buy. The valuationlooks compelling at 20x 2018E P/E, against 30% EPS CAGR over 2017-19.
        Keyrisks: slower-than-expected EMS growth and poor execution of investments.</p>
