        Companies expecting positive outlook in 2H17-2018.<br/><br/>
        O-Film expects CCM upgrade trend to accelerate in 2H17, and plans toexpand single/ dual-cam CCM capacity to

        high-power equipmentsales to remain strong in FY17-18E, driven by automotive/industrial/aerosectors. For ZTE,
        mgmt. expected solid growth from both smartphone/operators segments in overseas market in FY17-18E despite
        flattishChinese operators¡¯ CAPEX ahead of 5G investment cycle.<br/><br/>
        Industry focus shifting from smartphones to new products.<br/><br/>
        As the OEM for Alibaba/JD¡¯s smart speakers, Tonly believes smart audioproducts is a promising market given its
        integration into smart homeecosystem with AI/cloud services, and target to derive 50% of sales fromsmart audio
        in FY20E. DJI, the global drone leader with ~70% of mkt share,now generated 80-90% of sales from overseas mainly
        through offlinechannels (80% of sales). Following the success in consumer drones, DJIexpected agricultural drone
        market (3% of sales now) to become its nextgrowth engine after obtaining authorization in Europe and
        USA.<br/><br/>
        Our views on industry trends and sector outlook.<br/><br/>
        We remain positive on the technology upgrade trend in both smartphoneand non-smartphone space, given that 1)
        smartphone now becomes themost important consumer product which captures major consumer demandin
        social/communications, entertainment, cameras and payment/finance,etc, and 2) while small as a percentage of
        sales, emerging segments suchas AI/cloud, automotive and drones are poised to fuel industry growth innext
        decade.</p>
