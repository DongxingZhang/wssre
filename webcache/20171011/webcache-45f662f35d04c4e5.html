    <p> Refineries severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey<br/><br/>
        Over the last 4days the refining infrastructure in Texas has been hard hit byHurricane Harvey. As of Monday,
        13Texas based refineries with aggregatecapacity of 3.4mmbpd (Fig 2) have been impacted by the hurricane with as
        muchas over 2.5mmbpd (15% of US refining capacity) refining capacity being offline.But the impacted capacity is
        a moving target as media reports indicate that FlintHills Corpus Christi refinery could be evaluating re-start
        whereas the largest USrefinery- the 603kbpd Motiva Port Arthur refinery is evaluating shutdown.<br/><br/>
        Refining margins should rise<br/><br/>
        In response to the widespread outages spot Asian refining margins on Monday 28August were up 7% to USD9/bbl
        (USD8.2/bbl for week ending 25August). While itis too early to estimate the impact of the outages, we believe
        they should supportrefining margins in the near term. At the very least, these outages should helpdrawdown the
        high inventory levels in US especially for gasoline. Asian refiningmargins have averaged US$7.7/bbl QTD (+51%
        YoY, +21% QoQ) in 2QFY18due to strong demand, lower Chinese petroleum product exports compared toconsensus
        expectations and YoY higher refining maintenance shutdowns.Strong refining margins to benefit Oil Marketing
        Companies and Reliance<br/><br/>
        Industries<br/><br/>
        Indian refiners should benefit from these strong refining margins (Fig 1). Wereiterate our preference for Oil
        Marketing Companies (OMCs - IOC, BPCL &amp; HPCL)and Reliance Industries (RIL). We expect OMCs to benefit from
        robust refiningmargins, capacity expansions, higher fuel marketing margin and consumptiongrowth. We expect RIL
        should benefit from capacity additions in its core businessand robust downstream margins, resulting in EBITDA
        (ex-telecom) growth of&gt;35% over FY17-19E.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and Risks<br/><br/>
        We value the refining business of OMCs at 6x FY19E EV/E and marketing businessat 8x FY19E EV/E. We value RIL on
        an SOTP basis, using EV/E for refining andpetrochemicals and DCF for the E&amp;P; and telecom businesses. Key
        risks arevolatility in oil prices and policy vagaries.</p>
