    <p> Pre-close trading update (Q4) on Monday 11September<br/><br/>
        Comments about the unreported 12weeks of the financial year to mid-Septemberare likely to be something of a
        side-show, though we expect Primark¡¯s goodmomentum to have continued. A B Foods has already commented that
        thefull year should be strong, with Q3ahead of management expectations. Henceof greater importance is likely to
        be management's preliminary guidance forFY Sep-18. In particular, we look for comments about the margin
        expectationsat Primark. We see upside risk in this area, though management may guideconservatively at the start
        of the year. As we argue in our sector report ¡°Valuenot value traps¡±, published today, we think Primark¡¯s
        prospects are healthy andcontinue to rate A B Foods a Buy, with a raised target price.<br/><br/>
        Q4should build on a strong Q3<br/><br/>
        As detailed overleaf, this has been a good year for AB Foods despite currencychallenges for Primark. We expect
        the trading statement to confirm healthyEPS growth for the full-year, and forecast Adj. EPS of 123.7p. Based on
        KantarWorldpanel data, which has reported data covering 5of the final 12weeks of theyear, Primark UK's market
        share continues to grow. We expect Primark LFLs in Q4to be similar to Q3(c.+2%). Our FY Sep-17group Adj EBIT
        estimate of ¡ê1,334m(+19% yoy) includes ¡ê316m in Grocery, ¡ê215m in Sugar and ¡ê695m in Retail.<br/><br/>
        Looking ahead to 2018: c.11% EPS growth forecast<br/><br/>
        This time last year management guided Primark margins to decline by 200bps asit had decided to absorb the impact
        of adverse currency. In the end margins arelikely to have fallen by c.170bps. Hedging rates suggest there is
        residual pressureon Autumn/Winter gross margins, so would expect conservative guidance. Weassume Primark¡¯s
        margins decline in H118. However, there should be an FXtailwind in H218and as a result we forecast Primark
        operating margins to riseby 20bps to 10.1% in FY Sep-18E. This may prove conservative as the yearprogresses.
        Also we expect commentary on the Sugar business to be material:<br/><br/>
        we forecast flat profits y-o-y, with volume growth offsetting price declines.<br/><br/>
        Positive near term drivers, attractive long term: Buy, TP 3500p<br/><br/>
        We have raised forecasts by c.2-3% due primarily to more favourable currency,and our target price to 3500p. The
        stock, on CY18E P/E 23.1x, is not inexpensive.But the implied multiple for Primark (c.28x, we estimate), has
        historically tradedat higher levels and we continue to see upside. BuyDeutsche Bank AG/London</p>
