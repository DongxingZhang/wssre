        Brexit shock ¨C The Bank of England marked the week of Black Wednesday¡¯s 25-year anniversary by sending sterling
        to post-Brexit highs. The catharsis of 1992presaged what Mervyn King, the central bank¡¯s previous Governor,
        christened the NICEdecade, a period of non-inflationary consistent economic expansion. The niceness, however,
        relied on the accompanying rampupin globalisation. Indeed, British imports have grown from 20to 30per cent of
        output since 1992. Foreign-born workersaccounted for two-thirds of the country¡¯s employment growth since 1997.
        This positive supply shock dampened inflationallowing lower interest rates and consequently surging asset
        prices. Brexit threatens to play this in reverse. Annual growth inEuropean Union-born workers employed in
        Britain is already down to 40,000from 300,000. If this negative supply shock feedsinto existing currency-induced
        inflation, higher interest rates will see output growth and asset prices bearing the brunt.<br/><br/>

        Electric trucks ¨C After this week¡¯s iPhone X launch, technology fanatics have the unveiling of Tesla¡¯s much
        anticipated electrictruck on Oct 26to look forward to. And just as critics doubt consumer appetite for
        $1,000phones, electric trucks have their shareof sceptics. The doubters argue that electric powertrains cost an
        extra $48,000while batteries add weight and volume. Thismeans the payback period on an electric truck is three
        years, compared with 18-24months that trucking companies prefer. Yet,battery technology improvements mean the
        weight differential should soon be negligible and the payback period for electrictrucks should fall below two
        years by 2022, which could see them comprise one-tenth of the North American market. Meanwhile,automation costs
        quickly pay for themselves if regulatory concerns can be satisfied. The incremental cost of $23,000is half
        theannual salary of a driver.</p>
