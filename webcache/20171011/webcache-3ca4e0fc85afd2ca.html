    <p> Event 1- CBEC - Another year postponement of positive list and customclearance form¡£<br/><br/>
        On Sept 20, the State Council announced that the requirement for a CustomClearance Form (CCF) in order to import
        products via CBEC bonded warehouseswill be postponed further, until the end of 2018(previously from the end of
        2017).Meanwhile, the relevant government ministry will take the time to completethe supporting and regulatory
        policies. MOFCOM believes the above-mentionedpolicy has successfully accelerated the development of CBEC in
        China.¡£<br/><br/>
        Please refer to our previous reports for further details and impacts on differentretail categories: Cross-border
        ecommerce - new rules regulating the market (28March 2016) and China Consumers ¨C CBEC - 1-year postponement of
        positive listand custom clearance form confirmed (23May 2016).¡£<br/><br/>
        On Sept 21, MOFCOM stated that the extension was the result of the followingthree considerations:¡£<br/><br/>
        1. It increases the supply of retail markets, enabling domestic consumptionUpgrades¡£<br/><br/>
        2. It narrows the price difference between imported and overseas products, whichattracts outbound consumption
        back to domestic consumption¡£<br/><br/>
        3. As the scale of CBEC (imports) remains small, the consistency in policy willhelp shape future policy based on
        its industry development and characteristics.¡£<br/><br/>
        Event 2- Government supports the new unmanned retail format¡£<br/><br/>
        On Sept 21, MOFCOM explicitly expressed its positive view on the rise ofthe unmanned retail format, stating that
        it addresses consumers¡¯ fragmenteddemand with certain advantages on cost, efficiency and consumer
        experience.That said, as the new format is still at a development stage, there are challengesin relation to
        regulatory issues and advancement in technology. MOFCOM willannounce a framework on technology innovation in the
        retail industry and casestudies on technology applications at an appropriate time. This is to guide bigretail
        corporates in adopting new technology applications and meet consumers¡¯demand.¡£</p>
