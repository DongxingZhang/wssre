    <p> Raising target price for Pac Basin; also Buy MOL, CSET and MISC<br/><br/>
        The fourth quarter is peak season for dry bulk and tanker, but a slow periodfor container shippers. We expect
        BDIY to move up further and VLCC rates torebound from lows. Conversely, post a muted 3Q peak season, container
        ratesare poised to fall in 4Q. While the seasonality bodes well for bulkers, we expectdeclining newbuild
        supplies along with Ballast Water Convention (BWC) in 2019and Low-sulfur Regulation (LSR) in 2020to drive a
        multi-year upcycle for both drybulk and tanker. We see a good entry point ahead of the strong 4Q season and
        acyclical recovery in 2018-20. We recommend Buy Pac Basin (TP raised to HK$2.42on earnings upgrade) and MOL.
        Within the tanker space, CSET is a significantlaggard, trading at 0.5x P/B. We remain cautious on containers and
        reiterate Sellon CSH and OOIL.<br/><br/>
        Dry bulk - another good entry point<br/><br/>
        The supply growth YTD (+2.7%) has finally fallen short of demand (+3.4%), drivenby the combination of falling
        newbuild supplies (+3.9% vs. +4.4% last year) androbust demand (China's iron ore imports +7% yoy in 8M17). This
        undersupplygap is likely to widen further in 4Q, on continued drop in new supplies andseasonal uptick in demand.
        In the mid term, the adoption of BWC and LSR willsubstantially lift scrapping over 2019-20. This, together with
        falling newbuilddeliveries (24.4m/18.6m dwt in 2018/2019vs. 47m dwt in 2016), leads us toexpect 0%/-1.7% supply
        growth in 2018/19E (vs. average of 2.7% for 2015-17).We think this is another good entry point ahead of the
        imminent 4Q peak seasonand upcoming multi-year upcycle. On earnings upgrades, we raise Pac Basin'starget price
        to HK$2.42. We also have a Buy on MOL given its higher exposureto dry bulk.<br/><br/>
        Tanker - cycle has hit the bottom<br/><br/>
        The seasonal demand weakness along with rising new supplies has pushed downVLCC rates to US$7k/day lately (vs.
        industry breakeven of US$30k/day). However,we think this probably features the bottom of the cycle. With
        newbuild orderstapering off in 4Q and demand heading into peak season, tanker rates appear wellpositioned to
        recover. In the mid term, BWC and LSR potentially will help to scrapas much as 20%, which are above 15years. We
        expect VLCC utilization rates torecover from 82% in 2017E to 82.5% in 2018E and 85.8% in 2019E. CSET,
        despitesoft tanker rates YTD, continued to be profitable, largely thanks to its locked-inlong-term contracts on
        domestic crude oil and LNGs. Trading at 0.5x P/B, thecompany is a significant laggard in the shipping space and
        we expect the stock</p>
