    <p> Brazilian discretionary retailers continued to soar...<br/><br/>
        In August, 75% of our covered stocks showed positive returns, while only 54%outperformed their respective
        indices. Brazilian retailers BTOW3, ARZZ3,HGTX3, NATU3and LAME4led the way, followed by most of the
        Brazil-basedprotein producers (all with double-digit dollar returns). Year to date, LatAmFood, Beverages and HPC
        stocks are trailing their respective country indices by24%, 3% and 5% on average (respectively), while Retailers
        are outperformingby 11% (despite underperformance in four out of six food retailers).<br/><br/>
        ¡­but after an 18-month rally (and end of BR recession) it may be time to swap<br/><br/>
        The noticeable difference in the performance of discretionary versus defensivenames in the broader Latam
        consumer space, combined with the official endto the long Brazilian recession, suggests to us that a sector
        rotation is due oneof these days. Our only Buy-rated Brazilian retailer is CBD, and would be themain beneficiary
        of a swap out of early-cycle into later-cycle plays. ABEV isanother obvious choice, but in our view investors
        have jumped the gun on thisstock (that we continue to rate Hold). For those investors who want a cheaperway to
        play the incipient recovery in Brazilian beverage consumption, wesuggest AKOb.N, as Coca-Cola Andina derives
        more than a third of its salesfrom Brazil (and its other franchise territories are also at the cusp of
        recovery).<br/><br/>
        Among Brazilian names, our other Buy-rated name is BEEF3, as the recovery inlocal demand coupled with a positive
        cattle cycle and rising exports shouldbode well for FCF generation that would in our view drive significant
        upside forthis deleveraging story.<br/><br/>
        Monthly Feature: notes from last week¡¯s GEMS conference<br/><br/>

        FEMSA, Arcos Dorados, GrupoBimbo, Liverpool, Kimberly-Clark de Mexico and Cencosud. Inside we includesummaries

        Brazil protein export trends continue to move in the right direction<br/><br/>
        The negative impact of the Carne Fraca scandal that broke in late Marchcontinues to reverse. August SECEX data
        showed a beef export volumeincrease of 49% (albeit on an easy comparison of -7.7% in Aug. 2016) to reacha
        10-year high in absolute terms; similarly, poultry volume grew 16.4% (but ona less-easy comparison: -4.6% in
        Aug. 2016), reaching an 11-month high. Beefpricing fell by 0.5% yoy (i.e., was essentially flat) after ten
        months of increaseswhile poultry pricing also remained flat after a 2.0% fall in July (which in turnfollowed ten
        consecutive months of increases). Pork volume grew just 2.4%,but positive pricing trends continued (i.e., rising
        for the eleventh time in32months on a yoy basis).</p>
