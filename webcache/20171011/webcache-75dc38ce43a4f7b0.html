    <p> What we are saying to investors: Strong 1H earnings; prefer HSCEI。<br/><br/>
        We expect MSCI China/HSCEI to reach 83/11,900by end-17, driven by furtherearnings upgrades. We recommend
        overweight internet, financials, consumerservices (education), metals and mining (steel, non-ferrous) and
        water/IPPs,and underweight telecom, coal, airlines, traditional retailing and staples. Wethink HSCEI may
        outperform MSCI China in the rest of the year due to our OWpreference in financials.。<br/><br/>
        In 1H17, MSCI China headline growth edged up to 17% yoy from 6% in 2H16.Non-financial growth recovered more
        noticeably, to 37% in 1H17from theprevious 18%, led by a sharp acceleration in the upstream/downstreamsectors.
        Midstream earnings saw widened divergence. Reading across A-share2Q17results, we find profitability recovered,
        capex accelerated, gearing tickedup and restocking continued. Based on the good trend of the
        high-frequencyindicators we monitor, we expect 3Q earnings growth to be strong.We expect 2017/18E growth of
        18.5%/15.1% for MSCI China, driven by betternon-financial sales growth and a recovery in margins and financial
        earnings.。<br/><br/>
        Performance and valuations: MXCN gained 5%; CSI300added 3.5%。<br/><br/>
        MSCI China has gained 5% in the past four weeks, outperforming EM and Ashares.Deep cyclicals such as real
        estate, materials, IT and energy led, whileenvironmental and telecoms posted losses. The MSCI China (ex. ADRs)
        12mforward P/E stands at 11.1x or a 3% discount to the historical average; P/B is at1.4x or a 16% discount to
        the historical average. A-share CSI300rose3.5%/5.8% in RMB/USD for the same period of time, led by real
        estate,materials and non-bank financials. The index trades at 13.4x and 1.7x 12mforward earnings and book value,
        respectively.。<br/><br/>
        Macro and earnings: mixed macro data; significant A-/H-shr earnings upgrades。<br/><br/>
        Macro data came in mixed for August: 1) PMI stayed robust as NBS and CaixinPMI expanded to 51.7and
        51.6respectively, IP missed at 6.0% yoy vs. prior6.4%; 2) credit creation remained strong as new loans and TSF
        beatexpectations. Growth of key funding channels remained resilient at 15.5% yoywhile adjusted TSF dipped to
        14.8% yoy on sluggish municipal bond issuance;<br/><br/>
        3) Investment decelerated as FAI growth narrowed across infrastructure andmanufacturing. Property investment was
        largely stable at 7.9% ytd yoy. MSCIChina 17E consensus EPS was revised up by 4% in the past four weeks, led
        bydeep cyclicals such as energy, materials and real estate.。<br/><br/>
        Liquidity and sentiment: Liquidity remained strong; better A-share sentiment。<br/><br/>
        HK equities¨ ADT averaged HKD93bn in September so far, a touch lower thanAugust but well above YTD and last
        year¨s average. Connect inflows continuedin both the north- and southbound while the HKD slightly appreciated
        againstthe USD. Volatilities subsided from recent highs. A-share sentiment improvedacross the board as
        liquidity, new investors and margin activities all trendedhigher. Onshore rates moderated and credit spreads
        were unchanged.Risks。<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks: 1) tighter-than-expected monetary policy; 2) harsher-thanexpectedproperty tightening; 3) any
        disorderly deleveraging as China tightensshadow credit; and 4) sharper-than-expected RMB depreciation.。</p>
