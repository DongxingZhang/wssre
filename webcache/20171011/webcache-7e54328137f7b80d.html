    <p> Mixed views from investors on the new iPhone launch<br/><br/>
        Apple will release the new iPhone on 12 Sep. 9AM, PDT (13 Sep. 1AM, HK time). At this time of year, there is
        always the question of ¡°should one take profits¡± or ¡°should one add to positions¡±. We believe taking profits
        could work n-term, but taking a larger position should prevail for the long run. Historical data (Fig. 1) shows
        tier-one Asian iPhone suppliers tend to underperform for two months post a release event, as most new phone
        features have been widely anticipated. However, most of them tend to outperform after near-term bumps, as Apple
        impresses the world with new features in next year¡¯s iPhone. For the 2018 new iPhone, the new feature could be
        the advanced AR.<br/><br/>
        Why profit taking make sense in the near term?<br/><br/>
        Similar to prior years, after all new features have been widely discussed (an OLED display, a front-facing 3D
        sensing, wireless-charging, and double-sided glass designs), the knee-jerk reaction from trading-oriented
        investors would be ¡°take profits now, and add to positions later if the new iPhone sell-through proves to be
        good¡±. As illustrated in Figure 1, over the past five years, the share prices of tier-one iPhone suppliers in
        Asia surged 7% in a two-month period prior to the new iPhone release date, but declined 0%-4% for two months
        after the launch date.<br/><br/>
        Who could be relatively vulnerable post the new iPhone release in 2017?<br/><br/>
        In our view, iPhone component suppliers in Hong Kong/China could be more vulnerable to profit taking. Their
        share prices have rallied 14.7% on average over the past one month (Figure 2). On the other end, it seems profit
        taking on Taiwanese names are already in place, with Catcher and Hon Hai¡¯s share prices down 3.4% and 0.4%,
        respectively, over the past month (vs the TAIEX¡¯s rise of 2.6%).<br/><br/>
        Why we recommend adding more to positions for the long term?<br/><br/>
        For the long term, we continue to like tier-one iPhone component suppliers, as they are in a better position to
        capture the iPhone¡¯s spec upgrade cycle. Figures 3-6 show the share prices of tier-one vendors have consistently
        trended up over the past five years despite near-term profit-taking. For the new iPhone in 2018, advanced AR
        (Augmented Reality) could be the new feature in our view, enabled by the addition of a rear-facing 3D sensing
        module. Also, Apple might bring the full display design (which only appears in the premium SKU in 2017) to every
        new iPhone SKU in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Top buys, valuation and investment risks<br/><br/>
        Largan and AAC are our preferred iPhone 8 beneficiaries from a top-down perspective (ASP hike, resulting from
        spec upgrades) in our Greater China coverage. From a bottom-up view (share gain potential), Catcher is our
        favourite, as we estimate its market share in iPhone casings will likely grow from ~18% in 2016 to ~35% in
        2019E. Our target prices are derived from PER or PBR (see page 5 for details). Downside risks include weak
        iPhone demand, aggressive price cut and slow spec upgrades.</p>
