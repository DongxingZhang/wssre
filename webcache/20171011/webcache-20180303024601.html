    <p> Relative value<br/><br/>
        We have generally been cautious on the renewables sector in India, insteadpreferring metals &amp; mining and
        auto &amp; auto parts players. Our stance has beendriven by tight valuations, potential supply risk, possibility
        of SEBs negotiatingtariffs lower in old PPAs, aggressive growth plans (both organic and inorganic),innovative
        bond structures, etc. These also represent downside risks to Indianrenewable names, including Azure Power. Just
        within the sector, Greenkotrades the tightest (Hold; 2022s at 4.5% offer ytm; 2023s at 5%; 2024s at 5%)and
        perhaps rightly so, given relatively longer bond market history, GIC'smajority ownership and stronger structure.
        Between Renew Power 2022s (Sell,5.2% offer ytm) and Azure 2022s (5.1%) that are trading flat to each other,
        weprefer the latter with slightly better structure, listed status providing moretransparency, exposure to solar
        (rather than wind) and stronger customerprofile. However, on account of downside risks highlighted before, we
        initiateon Azure with Hold. Key upside risks include disciplined growth, improvementin tariffs, policy support
        for the sector, presence of marquee names in theshareholder roster, etc.<br/><br/>
