    <p> We met some credit investors in HK last week as typhoon Hato made landfall.<br/><br/>
        - Overall, we sense some complacency, which is not surprising in a lowvolatility environment. Everyone thinks
        valuations are expensive, but stayinvested with low cash balances as inflows are neutral to slightly
        positive.<br/><br/>
        'Lower for longer' rates continues to be a consensus view, with the NorthKorea headlines and US debt ceiling
        debate being considered as just noise.<br/><br/>
        Even the RMB appreciation is not expected to impact the onshore China bidwith most of the USD cash balances
        sitting outside the country, and moreimportantly, the appreciation is not foreseen to last for long. Only one
        investorasked about short/sell ideas.<br/><br/>
        - Having said this, some did raise concerns on implications of liquiditywithdrawal from Central Banks once QE
        stops from Europe and Japan, and theFed starts balance sheet unwind. Positioning has turned defensive
        withoverweights in IG vs. HY and BBs vs. Bs. In line with this, there were limitedquestions even on the event
        driven names. Also, the hedge fund community isrelatively less sanguine on credit, instead focusing more on
        equities wither fordividend yields or higher growth potential if growth remains supportive. A feware even going
        short credit vs. long equities. The real money investors are stilllooking to diversify some exposure outside
        Asia, with interest in US HY,Australia and Latam (less so Middle East on account of the Qatar issue).<br/><br/>
        - In terms of topical items, supply is the flavor of the season as we know.<br/><br/>
        Potential China sovereign issue came up in almost every meeting, withmarkets expecting a size of USD2 billion
        for 10 year deal. There wasagreement with our belief that this might end up being positive for the highquality
        Central SOE bonds (assuming spread differential of 40-50bp), a spacewe have liked. Plus, investors are talking
        about the large pipeline of sub debtissuance from Chinese FIs. View on possible HY supply from China is
        moremixed, with some expecting issuance to pick up significantly in Sep, whileothers arguing that NDRC will put
        a cap on it. For recent new issues, IndonesiaHY got most traction.<br/><br/>
        - Sector-wise, we fielded many queries on: 1) Indian telcos (we like the IGplayers and dislike HY ones); 2) Indo
        property (reiterate our negative stancehere); 3) commodities (we remain constructive and retain our preference
        fornon-oil players); 4) China property (our Buys here are concentrated with large,high beta companies); 5) AMCs
        (we are still more constructive thanconsensus); 6) Frontier sovereigns (retain our liking for Mongolia over
        SriLanka) Otherwise, India and Indonesia retain their status as relative 'safehavens' within Asia
        credit.<br/><br/>
