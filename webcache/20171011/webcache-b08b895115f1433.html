    <p> In the recent weeks, the press (e.g. Bloomberg, China Securities Journal etc)has been increasingly talking about
        an impending boom in hybrid capitalissuance by Chinese banks. We decided to take a closer look at the
        driversbehind it, which instruments are in question and how much supply couldactually spill over into external
        markets.<br/><br/>
        Regarding the drivers, there are two distinct trends that we would like tohighlight. Larger players in the
        Chinese banking system are more driven by theoverall desire to increase new business generation, while coping
        with therising Basel-III requirements and (for the big-4) still pending TLACimplementation. For the city and
        rural commercial banks, the trends are moredependent on the rising pressure from changes in
        Macro-PrudentialAssessment by the regulators and yet deteriorating asset quality. Hence thebanks in both camps
        face the dilemma of how to de-risk their RWAs and boostcapital ¨C especially the T1 portion of it.<br/><br/>
        Data show that YTD 13 listed banks disclosed their plans to issue ~RMB244bnworth of preferred stock, while an
        additional eight banks plan to issue a totalof RMB164bn of convertible bonds, with another six banks intending
        to raiseup to RMB120bn worth of capital (the structure not decided yet). Based onCBRC¡¯s data, the tendency for
        second-tier and rural banks to be in a greaterneed for equity replenishment is quite clear. The skew in favour
        of pref shareissuance vs. CBs is understandable given the risk of stock dilution andissuance being limited to
        A-listed banks.<br/><br/>
        According to CBRC, it has approved RMB184bn worth of pref shares issuancerequests by the banks YTD, of which
        RMB101.5bn has been explicitlyapproved for offshore placement. Of this amount, RMB50bn was OK¡¯d forPostal
        Savings Bank ¨C a top-10 lender in the country, while the remainingblocks ranging from RMB8bn to RMB15bn have
        been approved for smallerregional banks (Fig 1). Only Zheshang Bank from this list has already issued
        itsUSD2,175m AT1 bond (equivalent to RMB15bn at the time of placement) whilethe rest (~RMB86.5bn) are still
        pending. In our view, RMB101.5bn worth ofAT1 supply should be relatively well digested by the market. The one
        fromPostal Savings Bank could be in demand by larger banks in China, while theinterest for AT1 of smaller
        lenders would likely come from wider assetmanagers¡¯ community that still offer structured products to their
        end-clientswith AT1s (i.e. pref shares) being the underlying risk, and the funds raised fortheir acquisition are
        still able to get leverage in China.<br/><br/>
        What about T2 bonds? China Securities Journal reports that this year hasalready seen 60 banks successfully
        issuing T2 subordinated bonds totaling~RMB180bn, an increase of 71% YoY. The source further reports that there
        areseveral bank planning to place more than RMB150bn of T2 bonds in the nearfuture. CBRC¡¯s approvals do not
        specify whether they are given for domesticor offshore issuance, hence it is close to impossible to gauge which
        route theissuers would prefer. It¡¯s worth mentioning though that YTD we have not seena single offshore T2 bond
        issue completed by a Chinese bank.<br/><br/>
        Valuation-wise, T2 and especially AT1 notes issued by Chinese banks (evenunrated ones) have been trading at a
        considerably lower YTW vs. their Asian and global peers driven by the local demand. In our view the
        aforementionedexpected volumes of offshore supply of AT1 instruments are unlikely tomeaningfully impact current
        rich valuations of existing Chinese bank bonds.<br/><br/>
        This trend perhaps would remain unchanged until we approach the first calldate for an offshore pref share issue
        in China (Bank of China RMB39.9bn inOct-19 and ICBC USD3.9bn in Dec-19), which will be a test for this
        marketespecially given the rising pressure for the big-4 from pending TLAC adoption.</p>
