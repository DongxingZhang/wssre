    <p> Successful end of summer promotion; also, a good start for fall semester<br/><br/>
        Our estimated retention rate for summer promotion class is 48-50%, 6-8ppthigher than last year. The improvement
        in the retention rate, together with theexpanded entry-level promotion class, should deliver strong revenue
        growthand margin increase in later quarters, in our view. We raise our target price toUSD96, based on revised
        revenue and margin. Maintain Buy on decent riskreward.<br/><br/>
        What could go wrong? A high enrollment cancellation, but the possibility is low<br/><br/>
        Due to the flexible policy on enrollment cancellation, there could be somefurther cancellations in early
        September. The cancellation rate was high lastyear because some competitors intentionally used this policy to
        impact EDU¡¯sfall semester. This year, the summer promotion class has a higher price(RMB50vs. last year¡¯s RMB1)
        and learning centers check the enrollmentprogress strictly. Thus, we believe cancellations will be normal this
        September.<br/><br/>
        Pop Kids, 1x1and government policy worth monitoring<br/><br/>
        The three factors mentioned should witness rapid development or potentialchange in the near future. We believe
        these moving factors are worthmonitoring closely. For Pop Kids, enrollment growth in key cities and
        subjectexpansion will impact the total K-12revenue growth. We are positive on thetrend, considering the
        innovative IT system deployment, strong demand and arelative low base. The 1x1business has seen an
        extraordinarily strong organicgrowth. The next step is to manage the margin and fully leverage the EDUbrand in
        this market to improve the K12margin. For government policies, wespotted some regulation drafts already released
        in five provinces (see details inour policy change report). We note tutoring is not impacted. We would bemore
        worried about the government¡¯s ultimate attitude with regard toeducation resources in China, which is not
        clearly stated in the newregulations.<br/><br/>
        Target price USD96with Buy rating; decent risk-reward<br/><br/>
        The tutoring industry continues to benefit from strong demand for high-qualityeducation resources and the sticky
        selection method of academic exams. EDU,as one of the leaders, successfully leverages its education brand and
        shouldgrow its K-12business significantly (by 34% during FY18E-FY20E) with a lowtransition cost. Going forward,
        with more and more K-6exposure and tutoringsubject expansion, EDU can steadily accelerate revenue growth in the
        longrun. We believe it offers decent risk reward and maintain our Buy rating with atarget price of USD96. Our
        target price is based on 1.1x PEG against a rolledoverCY18E-20E, EPS CAGR of 29% and USD3.0non-GAAP EPS in
        FY18E.<br/><br/>
        Downside risks: 1) slower enrolment growth; and 2) unfavorable regulatorypolicy. See page 4for more details on
        valuation and risks.</p>
