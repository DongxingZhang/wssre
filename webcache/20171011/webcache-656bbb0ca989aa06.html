    <p> Top Buys: Eclat, Feng Tay, Moutai, Dali and Samsonite<br/><br/>
        1H17¡¯s results show that the market is trending better, with key themes, such as premiumization, health and
        leisure, and the wealth effect, playing an important role in sales growth. Corporates are also active in
        improving their business structures via a leaner supply chain or integration, especially those facing higher raw
        material costs. Into 2H17/2018, we believe kids/family and a rise in consumer credit will be additional themes.
        We like Eclat/Feng Tay (Nike supply chain theme), Moutai (strong demand + restocking), Dali (success in new
        products) and Samsonite (synergy and integration benefit from Tumi). Retaining Sell on Tingyi (new products yet
        to make an impact, given its size).<br/><br/>
        13 companies beat DB/market estimates &amp; nine missed; Hengan/H&amp;H; upgraded<br/><br/>
        Of the 40 companies under our coverage that announced 2Q or 1H17 results, 13 beat DB/market estimates and nine
        missed. Post results, we upgraded our recommendations on two companies (Hengan and H&amp;H;). Overall, we
        believe 2Q wasn¡¯t a bad quarter - for both staples and discretionaries. SSS for traditional channels/brands
        continue to recover with a better trend in 2Q.<br/><br/>
        Sportswear (incl supply chain), white wine and white goods - strongest growth<br/><br/>
        Overall, three quarters of the companies experienced yoy EBIT growth due to: 1) market recovery (less
        discounting/less inventory), 2) cost-saving in opex (offsetting GPM decline), and 3) a low base in 1H16. While
        we always say there is limited top line growth, ~half of the companies saw 10%+ sales growth in 1H17 due to: 1)
        acquisitions (e.g. white goods, Samsonite), 2) an extremely low base (Tingyi and H&amp;H;), and 3) companies in
        the right space (sportswear and its supply chain, white goods, and white wine).<br/><br/>
        Structural trends but corporates need the right strategy<br/><br/>
        Consumption upgrade/premiumization, the embracing of casualization and lifestyle experience, and the kids and
        family theme are the key macro trends, but we believe only corporates with visionary management will benefit
        from such trends, e.g. Yili and Mengniu¡¯s focus on the health-related space, Shenzhou¡¯s investment in Vietnam
        and automation in China, Anta¡¯s multi-brand strategy and Samsonite¡¯s strategic acquisition of Tumi.<br/><br/>
        Leaner supply chain is the buzz theme<br/><br/>
        In relation to operations, a variety of business reorganizations have been announced by companies. There is no
        one-size-fits-all model and each is mapping its model based on its own SWOT. But the common themes are a leaner
        supply chain, de-layering and speed to market. Companies with strong balance sheets are also more active in
        balance sheet management.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We use DCF and P/E-to-growth as tools to value the sector. DCF captures the future cash flow of consumer
        companies, while PE/G and relative P/E show a company¡¯s value relative to its peers. Downside risks: SSSg
        failing to pick up; channel inventory piling up; intense competition; product misses. Upside risks: a
        greater-than-expected rise in SSSg; higher operating leverage; weaker-than-expected input costs.</p>
