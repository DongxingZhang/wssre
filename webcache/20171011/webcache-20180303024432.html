    <p> Better earnings stability than a thermal peer, more upside than hydro peers<br/><br/>
        Positive tariff outlook, better capex discipline, improving free cash flow SDIC enjoys higher earnings
        visibility, as well as stability, than thermal power peers, due to its 57% capacity exposure to hydropower. Over
        2016-1H17, almost all the earnings came from the hydro segments. Meanwhile, SDIC¡¯s thermal business can also
        benefit from accelerating supply-side reform and year-end tariff hikes. We expect SDIC to turn FCF positive
        starting in 2018, thanks to earnings recovery and better capex discipline, indicating potential upside to our
        assumed 35% payout ratio and dividend yield of 3%. Relative to Yangtze Power, SDIC is an overlooked A-share
        hydro name, with an attractive valuation and similarly strong hydro capacity pipeline. Reiterating
        Buy.<br/><br/>
        Positive tariff outlook, better capex discipline, improving free cash flow<br/><br/>
        SDIC¡¯s 1H17 results were slightly below expectation, with a 13/37% yoy decline in reported/recurring net profit,
        but still much better than thermal peers, which are near breakeven. Thermal tariff recovered by 7.5% yoy, due to
        a lower DPS discount. Hydro tariff dropped 6% yoy in 1H17 but the declining trend slowed in the second quarter.
        Management expects the discount to narrow going forward, with less competition from peers. Furthermore, its
        inter-provincial hydro power sales tariff should benefit from the thermal tariff hike in July and potentially
        another round at year-end. In response to supply-side reform, SDIC is delaying three coal-fired generation units
        (total 3GW) and plans no other thermal capacity additions over 2017-19E. We expect its free cash flow to reach
        c.Rmb8.0bn in 2018/19E, supporting a stable dividend outlook.<br/><br/>
        Earnings revisions<br/><br/>
        We revise down our 2017/18/19E net profit forecasts by 14%/4%/1% to reflect higher fuel cost, delay in thermal
        projects, higher thermal tariff due to a lower DPS discount and July tariff hike, and lower hydro tariff due to
        higher discount.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Our TP is based on DCF with WACC of 7.0% and zero TGR. SDIC is trading at 12x 2018E P/E and 1.5x P/B, well below
        Yangtze¡¯s 17x P/E and 2.3x P/B. Risks: lower-than-expected thermal tariff hike, weaker water flow, higher coal
        prices.</p>
