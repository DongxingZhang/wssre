    <p> 1H17not a surprise; 35% net profit decline on 27% sales volume drop<br/><br/>
        Yutong Bus reported 34.8% YoY 1H17net profit decline to RMB805.1m. Thecompany¡¯s 1H17revenue decreased by 29.8%
        YoY to RMB9.3bn on the back of26.7% YoY decrease in bus sales volume to 21,828units. Yutong¡¯s 1H17net
        profitaccounted for 20% of our original FY17earnings forecasts and 21% of consensus.Although the result is lower
        than Yutong¡¯s recent year performance (1H16netprofit accounted for 31% of FY16profit and 1H1527% of FY15), we
        believe itbrings no surprises to the market given weak 1H17NEV bus sales.<br/><br/>
        Due to the product mix shift with decline in sales contribution from new energybuses and partially offset by
        reduction in procurement costs, in our view, grossprofit margin contracted merely by 26bps YoY to 24.2% in 1H17.
        Meanwhile,operating profit margin narrowed by 2.1ppt YoY on 1.9ppt YoY expansion in SG&amp;Aexpenses;
        ratio.<br/><br/>
        With a 55.7% decline in non-operating income, partially mitigated by 1)RMB39.5m gain on a change in fair value
        (vs. loss of RMB44.8m in 1H16) mainlyfrom financial assets; 2) RMB75.0m investment gain (up 1.7x YoY) due to
        highercontribution from JV/associates; and 3) 72.5% YoY decline in impairment loss onassets, 1H17net profit
        margin decreased 67bps to 8.6%.<br/><br/>
        On a quarterly basis, Yutong¡¯s 2Q17revenue declined 33.1% YoY but improved40.7% QoQ to RMB5.4bn. Gross profit
        margin remained flattish YoY and expanded1.6ppt QoQ to 24.8%. 2Q17net profit dropped 42.9% YoY but increased
        54.6%QoQ to RMB488.8m.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C new energy bus demand to recover; maintain Buy<br/><br/>
        We cut our FY17-19E revenue estimates by 8.9-13.6% and net profit by13.1-14.5% mainly on reduced NEV bus sales
        forecast. Meanwhile, we forecaststable NEV gross margins for Yutong going forward, on cost reduction andbetter
        mix mitigating cuts in subsidies, leading to consistent c.60% gross profitcontribution from the NEV bus
        business.<br/><br/>
        We believe the NEV bus demand will continue to recover on the clarificationof some local government subsidy and
        new subsidy eligibility list. MaintainBuy given our optimism on Yutong's increasing profit contribution from
        NEVbus segment. Target price is based on 14x FY18E P/E (rolled forward from 14xFY17E P/E), c.30% above Yutong's
        mid-cycle P/E of 11x to reflect our optimismon increasing profit contribution from the new energy bus. Key
        downside risksinclude: 1) unexpected changes in the Chinese government's new energy bussubsidy policy; 2)
        weaker-than-expected new energy bus demand; and 3) marketshare loss in new energy buses.</p>
