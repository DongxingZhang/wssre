        consecutive month on Tuesday. The lending rate wasalso kept unchanged (at 0.9%), while the overnight deposit
        rate was cut by 10bps(to -0.15%). Accordingly, the interest-rate corridor widened to 105bps. The cap forthe
        3-month deposit facility (HUF 300bn for Q3-17) was reduced to HUF75bn, i.e.by HUF225bn. This was slightly more
        than expected, and exceeded the HUF200bndelivered in June, though the Council also announced this would be the
        final cutand there will be no further reduction in the limit below HUF75bn. The Bank alsosaid the stock of swap
