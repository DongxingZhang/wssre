    <p> Optimistic on the long term outlook despite short term hiccup<br/><br/>
        Guoxuan High-tech delivered flat YoY sales revenue and -17% YoY NPAT dropin 1H17, which was attributed to 1)
        uninspiring downstream battery demand,led by EV policy change, 2) batteries contract ASP decline, and 3)
        upstream rawmaterial price hike. Extrapolated from the company¡¯s 9M17bottomline guidance,we believe that margin
        pressure will likely remain for the coming quarter. Inthe long run, Guoxuan is planning to strengthen its
        market-leading position todeliver high quality product with scale, and we think the company will still be
        thebeneficiary of the rising EV tide in China. In our view, the current share price haslargely factored in the
        expected strong growth in the future; maintain Hold.</p>
