    <p> Can we get back to August yet? Unless you are well connected to Kim Jong-unor to a lesser extent Mr Trump then
        it¡¯s impossible to answer. However a lack ofescalation over the weekend and more reassuring words from a top US
        generalhas been a big relief for markets. As it¡¯s the 15th today we're clearly at the midmonthpoint that the
        North Korean leader previously suggested was his timetableto potentially launch missiles at Guam although as
        we'll see below NK state mediahas suggested overnight that he is reviewing his plans and will watch the USfirst.
        It will be difficult for markets to fully recover their poise until we're out ofthis mid-month window with no
        new provocations (or worse). However every daythat no news breaks should help markets recover to where they were
        before lastMonday evening's "fire and fury' tweet after the earlier Washington Post storythat Pyongyang has
        produced a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside oneof its missiles.</p>
