    <p> Company clearly committed to investment step up throughout the year<br/><br/>
        We recalibrate estimates to reflect higher investment for the rest of FY18.Management announced these intentions
        at the June 8/9investor event. Wecut RMB6b for FY18non-EBITDA to RMB104b to reflect more adequatelyAlibaba¡¯s
        intention to grow B2C market share. Our cut in profits also reflectsrising video spend. Recall that Alibaba
        granted commission rebates tomerchants in the June Q. We envision investment growing beyondcommission rebating
        to include coupons, other marketing promotions andenhanced logistics support. We reduce FY18E non-GAAP EBITA for
        corecommerce (incl. Intime) RMB5.4b and cut non-GAAP EBITA on digital mediaand entertainment by RMB0.7b to
        reflect Youku content spend. We maintainFY18E revenue growth of 48.5% (the high end of guidance) on
        continuouslyimproving ad personalization and other data analytics tools increasingmerchant ROI. Reiterate Buy on
        core commerce strength.<br/><br/>
        Full-on preparation begins for Singles Day<br/><br/>
        Brand interviews have revealed that Alibaba is well into Singles Day prep withmerchants. The company will launch
        a centralized page for merchants, offeringpast transaction records, suggested staff allocation and sales
        strategies, andreal-time transaction monitoring tools for pre-sale. Recall that 2016SinglesDay achieved RMB121b
        in GMV (+32% YoY). With competition in apparel andelectronic products having dominated past Singles Days, we
        expect homefurnishings to become another category to see intensive competition.<br/><br/>
        Growing adoption of the Brand Databank<br/><br/>
        Alibaba recently announced eight partner service providers (incl. Baozun) inrolling its databank for large
        brands. The brand databank enables far betteruser data analytics, digital marketing optimization, content
        creation, onlineofflineuser data integration, and enhanced CRM. We believe this functionalityis driving higher
        ROI. We note that over 20brands have already adopteddatabank, including Huawei, Unilever and L¡¯Oreal. Lancome,
        for instance,utilized databank during the Tmall Super Brand Day and increased ROI/CTR by74%/37% respectively. We
        expect broader adoption in the coming Singles Day.<br/><br/>
        Cutting TP by 4.3% to US$199; Maintain Buy<br/><br/>
        We largely maintain FY18/19/20revenue forecasts, and reduce non-GAAPEBITDA by 6%/4%/4% to reflect the higher
        investment in core commerce andYouku. We reduce non-GAAP net income by 7%/4%/4% respectively. Our TP isbased on
        an unchanged SOTP: 1) 33x CY18E P/E for e-commerce; 2) 8x CY18EEV/Sales for Alibaba Cloud; 3) 29x CY18E
        EV/EBITDA for Ant¡¯s payment andWM business, and 5.5x CY18E P/BV for the loan and insurance business; 4)Cainiao
        valuation on latest capital raise; and 5) Net cash excluding AlibabaCloud. Risks: slower revenue and user
        growth; intensifying competition; andinability to expand or monetize Alibaba Cloud business.</p>
