    <p> Macau - Better infrastructure supports long-term visitation growth (Karen Tang)<br/><br/>
        In China's upcoming 19th National Congress (Oct 18-24th), we believe the "Guangdong-HK-Macau Greater Bay Area"
        will likely be a key policy initiative. To support Macau's development into a "Global Tourism Center", we
        believe the Chinese government will ease travel arrangements and improve transport infrastructures. This should
        help lift Macau's long-term visitor growth from 2% CAGR in 2012-16 to 5% CAGR in 2017-20F. Together with higher
        spend per visitor, this should allow Macau's GGR to grow at 9% CAGR over the next three years. We see Wynn Macau
        (Buy) and MGM China (Buy) as biggest beneficiaries as their new Cotai properties can absorb the most incremental
        high-end visitors. Sands (Hold) should also benefit given 89% of its EBITDA comes from mass &amp; non-gaming.
