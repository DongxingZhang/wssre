    <p> Current price not factoring in the significant slowdown<br/><br/>
        Dr. Peng continues to see pressure in its core broadband business withbroadband access revenue down 6% and its
        net adds slowing to ~100k in2Q17, the lowest rate in the past 4-5years. Meanwhile, gross margin andARPU continue
        to decline and the business had to cut its opex by 10% in orderto deliver a more respectable 3% decline in net
        profit. Capex slowed sharply in1H17and while this is a prudent move, future growth might also slow. Withthe
        shares trading on 33x FY17EPS, this slower future growth does not seemto be factored in; retaining
        Sell.<br/><br/>
        Quarterly data show a deteriorating trend<br/><br/>
        2Q17revenue declined 5% while gross profit fell 17%, a deterioration vs. thetrends seen in 1Q17. The company cut
        its 2Q sales and marketing expense by23% and management expense by 18% in order to deliver a flat profit but
        thisclearly had an impact on customer acquisition with net adds reducing to 100kin the quarter (vs. an average
        of 700k in the past 2years). With Dr. Peng¡¯sbroadband ARPU at RMB42/m, still significantly higher than China
        Mobile atRMB35/m, and given limited bundling offerings to differentiate its offerings,we think Dr. Peng¡¯s
        business model continues to be challenged. Capex diddecline to RMB1.2bn in 1H17from an average of RMB1.9bn in
        the previousfour halves, but the pace of its network rollout also slowed, adding only 2mhouseholds in coverage
        in the half.<br/><br/>
        Earnings changes<br/><br/>
        We have reduced our earnings forecasts in line with the lower-than-expected1H17results. We have removed the
        equity raising, which increased the EPS.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We value Dr. Peng based on the mid-point of our peer-based valuation andDCF. Risks relate to market share, tax
        rate, regulation, and margins.</p>
