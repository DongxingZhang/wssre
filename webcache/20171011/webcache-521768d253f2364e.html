    <p> Update on China¡¯s DES initiative: progress, outlook and impact¡£<br/><br/>
        Since the guidelines on banks¡¯ debt-to-equity swap (DES) were released a yearago, roughly Rmb1tr DES contracts
        have been signed. As the majority of theequity conversions targeted industrial SOEs, this Rmb1tr made up c.5%
        ofindustrial SOE debt. The implementation seems rather slow, however, withonly c.10% of projects completed.
        Overall, we do not expect DES itself to be alarge-scale event, reflecting its case-by-case nature and lukewarm
        demandfrom both outside investors and target companies. As such, the impact onbanks¡¯ capital and earnings should
        be quite limited. Over the longer term, weview DES as a supplementary measure to the real reform package on
        SOEs.A deep-dive into 71recent DES cases¡£<br/><br/>
        Our proprietary database has collected 71DES cases worth Rmb912bn, whichare being conducted for 60target
        companies by 12banks. If these proposedcases are all completed, it would convert 14% of the total debt of
        thesecompanies into equity and bring down their liabilities-to-assets ratio by 7ppt to68.2% (Figure 2). The
        selection criteria look strict so far, as most cases targetlocal SOEs with leading positions in industrial
        sectors, such as coal, steel andtransportation (Figure 8). CCB has been the most active among peers
        andcontributed more than half of DES cases. Based on the cases with disclosures,banks are mainly converting
        performing loans into equity with a conversionprice at par and introducing outside investors. We provide details
        of the keyfeatures of DES transactions on pages 3-6.¡£<br/><br/>
        DES is unlikely to be a large-scale event¡£<br/><br/>
        Our baseline case estimates the size of DES at around Rmb1.5-2.0tr, equivalentto 2-3% of total SOE debt, or
        8-10% of total industrial SOE debt. On the supplyside, this is because it has to be done selectively, given the
        stringent selectioncriteria for viable companies. On the demand side, we calculate the amount ofdebt of
        industrial SOEs that needs to be converted into equity in order toachieve the 60% target of
        liabilities-to-assets ratio by 2020, and it comes toRmb1.4tr (Figure 11). In addition, we expect rather lukewarm
        demand fromoutside investors, given the long investment horizon and we estimate there areroughly Rmb2tr
        available funds to invest in DES. The slow implementation sofar indicates that DES is unlikely to be a
        large-scale event, due mainly to theimproving profitability of industrial SOEs (Figure 13).¡£<br/><br/>
        DES is a supplementary measure to supply side reform and SOE reformWe believe that if just employed by itself,
        DES is not an effective solution forSOE deleveraging. Instead it has to be implemented in the context of
        acomprehensive reform package which includes supply side reform and mixedownership reform. In recent DES cases,
        we are encouraged to note more signsof operational restructuring for target companies initiated by banks. That
        said,to effectively delever the SOE sector and improve capital allocation, we believeChina needs to
        remove/soften its GDP target, further rationalize excessivecapacity, accelerate SOE reform and reduce government
        intervention in DES.We highlight our policy recommendations on page 9-10. Reflecting such asmall amount of DES,
        and most funding sources being booked off-balancesheet,the impact on banks¡¯ capital and earnings should be
        limited. This shouldrelieve some investor concerns about DES. We stay positive on big banks, withICBC and BOC as
        top picks.¡£</p>
