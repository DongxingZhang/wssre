        (Reuters)Market participants assess impact of Hurricane Harvey on scrap and steelmarkets. Similar to 2012¡¯s
        Hurricane Sandy, US scrap prices could surge postthe storm as scrap outflow becomes temporarily constrained.
        Supply is alreadytight and damage is yet to be completely assessed. Eventually, the scrapgenerated will flow
        into the market. Scrap dealers noted that when a stormstrikes, light iron and shreddables come out first,
        followed by automobiles,non-ferrous grades and heavier steel. Platts' daily shredded scrap assessmentstood at
        $305-$320/t. (SBB)Global automotive market expected to grow 2-3% in 2017 to 96m units, perInternational

        wasabolished and only 3% GST was imposed, creating a profitable situation forimporting gold from South Korea,
        which led imports to surge to $339m fromJuly 1 to August 3 (vs. $70m in FY16). India¡¯s total imports expected to
        reach850-950 tons by 2020, per World Gold Council. (Bloomberg Finance LP)China¡¯s net imports of gold from Hong
