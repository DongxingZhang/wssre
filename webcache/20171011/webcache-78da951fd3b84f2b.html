    <p> NBS Indicated Debt Risk in China is Manageable (Caixin, September 6)<br/><br/>
        NBS indicated China¡¯s leverage ratio was at c.250% in end-2016, positioned inthe middle level among global
        peers. It is said overall risk in China iscontrollable given the leverage ratio in household and government
        departmentmaintain low at below 50%/40% respectively. Although local governments¡¯leverage is higher than central
        government, while those debt were mainlyinvested in public infrastructure, which has already formed meaningful
        amountof high-quality assets with stable cash flow for debt repayment. Meanwhile,foreign debt only accounted for
        a minimal portion of total debt in China, ienon-financial corporates¡¯ foreign debt represented only 4% total
        debt. Thesaving rate in China is also high at 50%, which could provide support tocorporates¡¯ funding. Besides,
        the government has sufficient risk-managementexperience in the past 10-15years. Net net, NBS believes overall
        debt risk inChina looks manageable. As of July, above-scale industrial enterprises¡¯leverage ratio dropped by
        0.7ppt yoy, and industrial SOEs¡¯ leverage alsoimproved by 0.5ppt yoy. Till end-August, 3,258listed corporates
        have reported1H17financial statements, among which 75% corporates¡¯ operation cash flowhave improved.<br/><br/>
        [DB view] In the near term we do note there are incremental improvements inChina¡¯s debt structure. The strict
        implementation of supply-side reforms isdriving up the profitability of industrial SOEs, which were perceived as
        themost troubled areas. Property risks have moderated as consolidationmomentum has picked up. This should
        relieve asset quality concerns for thesetwo sectors (c.35% of total credit) and also be supportive for banks¡¯
        assetyields. Meanwhile we expect China¡¯s financial deleveraging campaign to beorderly before the leadership
        transition. This is why we are positive on the bigbanks and expect cyclical recovery in their fundamentals. Over
        the long run,we believe the probability of systemic banking crisis is low, given limitedexternal debt, high
        saving rate and strong influence on domestic liquidity byPBOC. That said, the structural issue in China is
        mainly about the misallocationof capital, as due to 6.5% GDP targeting more credit were extendedto
        less-productive areas (e.g. SOEs and local governments). The inefficiency ofcapital allocation might put
        downward pressure on banks¡¯ asset yield andhence profitability over the longer run. The upside risks to improve
        capitalallocation include removal or softening GDP targeting, deepening SOE reform,encouraging private
        investment and stricter control on local government debt.Please see our report Time to accumulate big banks.</p>
