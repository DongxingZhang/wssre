    <p> 34% earnings growth thanks to FX gain and logistics business disposal<br/><br/>
        China Eastern Airlines (CEA) reported 8.3% 1H17total income YoY growth toRMB53.2bn, driven by 10.2% YoY
        passenger traffic (RPK) growth and partiallyoffset by passenger yield decline, especially for international
        routes, and thedisposal of freighter operation. With a 45.2% YoY jump in fuel cost on higherfuel price,
        mitigated by a mild 3.4% YoY increase in ex-fuel operating cost(after disposal of Eastern Logistics), the
        airline recorded a 11.6% YoY decline in1H17operating profit to RM6.3bn. However, with 73.9% YoY drop in
        financecost (due to FX gain of RMB674m in 1H17vs. RMB1,355m FX loss in 1H16),CEA¡¯s 1H17reported net profit
        increased 34.4% YoY to RMB4.3bn. Strippingout the FX impact, CEA¡¯s 1H17core net profit indeed decreased by 20.0%
        YoYto RMB3.7bn.<br/><br/>
        Deutsche Bank view ¨C The better positioned network carrier in China<br/><br/>
        CEA¡¯s 1H17core net profit accounts for 56% of our FY17earnings forecast,and we consider the results as above our
        expectations. In July, CEA registereda 7.6% YoY RPK growth on high base. We remain upbeat on the
        airlines¡¯business operation, going forward, as we expect the yield trend to improve,after attaining higher load
        factor YTD. We also see long-term upside potentialfrom its LCC unit, China United Airlines (CUA). All in all, we
        think CEA is betterpositioned with its Shanghai hub, and all of the aforementioned factors shouldstill translate
        into an improvement in CEA¡¯s long-term earnings outlook. Hence,we maintain our Buy rating on CEA-H, but a Sell
        rating on CEA-A due to theexcessive A-share FY17/18E P/BV valuation. We will provide more details afterthe
        company¡¯s telephone conference on 30August.</p>
