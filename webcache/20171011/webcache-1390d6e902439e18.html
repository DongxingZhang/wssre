    <p> OP margin expanded 120bps to 12.2% in 2Q17, helped by 245bps expansion inGP margin due to better product mix and
        stablizing raw material price, while partlyoffset by higher A&amp;P; expense ratio.<br/><br/>
        Three reasons for the strong sales recovery<br/><br/>
        Yili's recurring sales growth improved from 6% yoy in 1Q17to 20% in 2Q17.We think this is mainly due to three
        reasons. Firstly, consumer staple sectorgenerally saw demand recovery from 2Q17, helped by recovering
        infrastructureand property investment from 2016and a lower base; secondly, competition inliquid milk is easing,
        thanks to more balanced supply and demand; and thirdly,Yili's strong distribution network and branding in
        high-end products makes it wellpositioned in the recovery. We believe these reasons should continue to
        driveYili's sales in the near-term.<br/><br/>
        Reiterating Buy<br/><br/>
        We revise up our earnings forecast by 10-12% in 2017-19E, mainly to factor inhigher sales growth driven by
        industry recovery and Yili's product mix upgrade.</p>
