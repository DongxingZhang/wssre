    <p> We believe that the August inflation print has opened the door for moreaggressive easing by the CBR in
        September.<br/><br/>
        CPI inflation surprises on the downside in August, to post a 0.5% MoM decline inprices (prev. +0.1% MoM,
        consensus -0.2% MoM), sending the headline inflationfigure down by 0.6pps to 3.3% YoY (consensus 3.7% YoY). Food
        price inflation,which had seen a spike in June as bad weather conditions affected the pricesof fruits and
        vegetables, has declined in July and August as the effect of thetemporary supply-side shock seems to have begun
        to fade. Also important to notethat the increase in oil prices and the slight weakening of the ruble did not
        haveany material impact on Russian inflation in August. Core inflation continued tosoften in August with the
        ROSSTAT¡¯s measure declining to a historic low of 3.0%YoY.<br/><br/>
        We expect the disinflationary trend to continue with annual inflation fallingfurther to 3.1% YoY by
        year-end.<br/><br/>
        The spike in annual inflation in June due to supply-related effects on food priceinflation has proved to be
        temporary with headline inflation back on a downwardtrend. The headline figure went below 4.0% in the previous
        month for the firsttime since the CBR officially became an inflation targeting central bank and hasnow undershot
        on the target considerably. According to the central bank's Julystatement, inflation slowdown is consistent
        across regions and in the consumerbasket with a growing proportion of goods and services posting price
        growthrates around 4%. Inflation expectations in August fell to a historical low of 9.5%from 10.7% in July. A
        faster-than-expected recovery in domestic demand remainsa risk to inflation, though the CBR has observed that
        the disinflationary effect ofincreasing domestic demand has declined.</p>
