    <p> In this report, we provide our read of Petrobras¡¯ 2Q17 results and update ourforecast model and sensitivity
        tables, as well as relative value charts. We arenot changing our views on Petrobras¡¯ credit profile and
        prospects or our Holdrecommendation on the company¡¯s fixed-rated USD bonds due 2019 andbeyond. 2Q results were
        somewhat soft in our view, driven mainly by weakerdownstream top line and E&amp;P; production relative to LTM
        figures. But recentcost-cutting efforts, capex discipline and asset sale proceeds have helped thecompany keep
        its deleveraging pace, ending the quarter with net leverage of3.15x in USD terms (-0.3x qoq). Our base-case
        forecasts point to sustainingfree cash flow in the USD+6bn handle in upcoming years and net leveragedropping
        further to 2.8x in 2019, assuming a flat Brent price of USD50/bbl. Wealso forecast a 2019 Brent-equivalent cash
        flow breakeven per boe ofproduction in the high USD30s / low USD40s area, which provides animportant cushion to
        downside risks to near-term oil prices and the executionof the company¡¯s divestment program, as well as risks to
        E&amp;P; productiontrajectory due to lower capex. Despite the company¡¯s positive standalonefundamental momentum
        and positive bond relative value to EM peers in the 5-and 10-year areas, in our view, we justify our Hold
        recommendation withcurrent tight bond spreads on a historical basis, our conservative stance onnear-term oil
        prices, and Brazil¡¯s fragile macro, political and fiscal situation.<br/><br/>
        Soft quarter relative to LTM figures on the back of lower E&amp;P; production,weaker downstream prices, and
        lower oil products sale volume; recurring FCFassuming USD17bn annual sustaining capex was -54% vs. LTM, at
        USD+1.0bnPetroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras, PETBRA) reported somewhat soft 2Q17 resultsrelative to its recent
        quarterly figures, with reported adjusted (companyadjusted)EBITDA of USD5.94bn that was 16% below the average
        for the lastfour quarters in USD terms (no meaningful seasonality), and 6% lower thanBloomberg consensus
        estimates. EBITDA adjusted by additional non-recurringand non-cash items1 (DB-adjusted EBITDA) was 12% lower
        than the averagefor the last four quarters (USD terms), at USD7.16bn. The key drivers of theweaker DB-adjusted
        EBITDA (compared to the last four quarters) include: 1)E&amp;P; production that was 1.6% lower than the
        last-twelve-month (LTM)average, at 2.66 Mboepd; 2) lifting costs 4% above the LTM average (in USDterms), at
        USD11.2/boe; 3) domestic oil products sales volume 3% lower thanthe LTM average (and 8% lower yoy), at 1.93
        Mboepd; and 4) domestic oilproduct realization price 2% below the LTM average (in USD terms), atUSD68.2/boe,
        compared to a flat Brent price (vs. LTM average). The domesticE&amp;P; business¡¯ adjusted EBITDA was 3% below
        the LTM average, at USD4.9bn(USD19.3/boe, or 68% of total DB-adjusted EBITDA), while the domesticdownstream
        business¡¯ adjusted EBITDA was 20% below the LTM average, atUSD2.4bn (33% of DB-adjusted EBITDA).<br/><br/>
        The operational cash flow before working capital variation and after interestwas 28% below the LTM average (in
        USD terms), at USD4.3bn, as a result oflower EBITDA and higher net interest and cash tax charges; while the
        recurringfree cash flow (FCF), assuming USD17bn of annualized sustaining capex, was54% lower than the LTM
        average (in USD terms), at USD+1.0bn. The realized FCF was USD+0.8bn, due to USD-0.3bn of working capital uses
        and USD-0.9bn of non-recurring operational charges, while capex of USD3.2bn was 26%lower than the
        USD4.3bn/quarter sustaining level and guidance for 2017.</p>
