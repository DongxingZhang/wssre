    <p> September¡¯s FOMC meeting maintained the Fed Funds Target Rate at1.00-1.25%, but announced the start date for
        balance sheet normalization forOctober, in line with expectations.<br/><br/>
        Balance sheet normalization will begin in October using theframework outlined in June, starting at a maximum
        pace of USD 10 bn, butthe limit will accelerate rapidly by USD 10 bn per quarter (USD 6 bntreasuries, USD 4 bn
        MBS); if maturing assets do not reach maximum pace,the Fed will not sell off additional assets to match maximum
        runoff pace.<br/><br/>
        Forecast approximately USD 922 bn of balance sheet reduction(current balance sheet: ~USD 4.45 tn, pre-crisis:
        ~USD 900 bn) by end of2019 under current proposed pace: equivalent to roughly 34 bp rate hike, amanageable
        impact, under current pace would need until roughly 2025 toreturn to pre-crisis levels, an unlikely
        outcome.<br/><br/>
        FOMC maintained forecasts for three rate hikes in 2018 and one moreby the end of 2017; futures market rate hike
        odds spiked from 57% to 78%following announcement, latest month¡¯s rising inflation data boostedprobabilities,
        but expectations have been volatile.<br/><br/>
        FOMC adjusted some of its macro forecasts as well: GDP revised upfrom 2.2% to 2.4% YoY in 2017, unchanged at
        2.1% in 2018, core inflationrevised down from 1.7% to 1.5% YoY in 2017, 2.0% to 1.9% YoY in 2018,unemployment
        forecast revised down from 4.2% to 4.1% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        In line with our previous guidance, the DXY has stabilized somewhat,following the FOMC statement, the DXY rose
        to 92.5; fluctuation in the 90-99range remains our base case for the rest of the year, with dollar upside
        likelycontingent on positive policy developments</p>
