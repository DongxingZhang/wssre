    <p> 1H17results should be in-line with consensus<br/><br/>
        Baosteel announced its 1H17results after market close on August 24. In 1H17,the company has recorded revenue of
        RMB170.1bn, RMB 8.51bn for operatingprofit, and NPAT of RMB 6.2bn. The company¡¯s bottom line reached
        42.1%FY17DBe and 48.1% Bloomberg 2017full year estimates. We believe the1H17results is in-line with consensus
        but disappointed DBe as a result oflower-than-expected GP/t.<br/><br/>
        2Q17GP/t down RMB325/t, but our full year forecast remains intact<br/><br/>
        The company¡¯s shipment volume in 2Q17came at 12mt, up 12% QoQ. 2Q17.ASP dropped RMB350/t QoQ, in line with
        market price movement for flat steelproducts. Baosteel¡¯s steel products 2Q17GP/t dropped by RMB325/t QoQ,which
        compressed GPM to 10.4% in 2Q17from 16.3% in 1Q17. With QTDHRC spread (as a proxy for steel plate profitability)
        already improved byc.RMB400/t, we remain comfortable with our FY17NPAT estimate ofc.RMB14bn given the optimistic
        profitability outlook for 2H17. Our FY17DBeNPAT is currently 12% above Bloomberg consensus.<br/><br/>
        Outlook remains positive, maintain Buy<br/><br/>
        We expect profitability improvement in 3Q17for Baosteel due to upcomingpeak demand season driven by seasonal
        recovery in auto production.Meanwhile, winter pollution measures will likely keep 4Q17D/S of steel markettight
        (Details in our report: Undervalued structural changes, reiterating Buy forsteel sector, published on 18July
        2017). These will likely play out to be thecatalysts to let Baosteel¡¯s profitability remain upbeat. Thus, we
        maintain ourBuy rating for Baosteel.</p>
