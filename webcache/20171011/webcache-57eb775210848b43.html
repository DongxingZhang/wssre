    <p> This week, the US and Eurozone will release two inflation indicators: the US July PCE inflation and the Eurozone
        August HICP inflation. Given the US¡¯s near-full-employment job market and the Eurozone¡¯s solid economic
        recovery, inflation developments have become the key determinant for the two central banks in making their
        monetary policies later this year. As the wage growths in both economies still stay weak, as well as the
        previous lift from energy prices has faded and some specific industrial changes have created a notable drag on
        price levels, we do not expect to see significantly strengthened inflationary pressures in either of the
        economies.<br/><br/>
        For the US, the minutes of Fed¡¯s July monetary policy meeting stated clearly that the lack of inflation has
        become a concern, at least for some members. Fueled by Trump¡¯s stimulus fiscal plan and the recovery of crude
        oil prices, the US¡¯s inflation reached its highest level in February, with the headline CPI at 2.7% YoY, core
        CPI at 2.2% YoY, headline PCE at 2.2% YoY and the Fed¡¯s preferred measure, core PCE, at 1.9% YoY. Afterwards,
        all inflation measures turned to continuous drops, falling back to around 1.4% YoY for PCE measures in June, and
        1.7% YoY for CPI measures in July. Given the still falling inflation expectations, we expect this week¡¯s PCE
        data to stay around the current levels of 1.4%-1.5% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Specifically, despite the lackluster wage growth, which explains why we have not seen a strong uptick of core
        inflation in the US, other industry specific changes also contributed to the drop of US¡¯s core PCE data. 1) the
        recent price war in the telecom industry has significantly dragged down the telecommunication services price by
        around -9% YoY since March, which caused around 0.1 ppt fall in headline PCE inflation; 2) the price growth of
        financial services significantly decreased from around 6% YoY in January to 3.3% YoY in June. But unlike the
        telecommunication services the financial services price surged during last year and the recent drop in price
        growth is just returning to its 10-year average level. Together, the price fall of telecommunication services
        and the decelerated price growth of financial services have contributed to around 0.25 ppts fall of the headline
        PCE or almost 0.3 ppts fall of the core PCE this year. Looking forward, as the price war in the telecom industry
        has come to an end and the price growth of financial services has dropped back to 10-year average, these two
        factors¡¯ drag on the core PCE should gradually fade. But still, we do not expect the core PCE to reach the 1Q
        levels, but only stabilize in the near future.<br/><br/>
        For Eurozone, the region¡¯s inflationary pressure showed some signs of mild recovery, but still not strong enough
        to push the HICP inflation towards the 2% target. Due to the improved outlook of economic growth, especially the
        solid domestic demand, the core HICP inflation is generally on an upward trend this year, increasing from 0.9%
        YoY in January to 1.2% YoY in July and inflation expectations have been increasing since June. However, still
        dragged by the weak energy prices, the overall inflation level stayed sluggish at around 1.3% YoY. For the
        sub-categories in HICP inflation, transportation contributed the most notable drag, but the prices of ¡°fuels and
        lubricants¡± is the real reason behind the drag. Moreover, despite some gradual improvements, Eurozone countries
        continue to suffer from high unemployment and low wage growth, which will hinder the development in inflation.
        Thus, we expect the August HICP data to be stable at around 1.3% YoY this week.<br/><br/>
        Based on the inflation outlook, we maintain our previous view that both the Fed and the ECB could act less
        aggressively in making their monetary policy decisions. The Fed could replace a third rate hike with the start
        of its mild balance sheet reduction; and the ECB could even announce to extend the current asset purchase
        program for several months before announcing the tapering, if it does not see convincing signals on improvements
        of inflation by its September / October meeting.</p>
