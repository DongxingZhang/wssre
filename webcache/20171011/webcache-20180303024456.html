        Chinese infrastructure growth in winter season could decline as Ministry ofEnvironmental Protection has
        requested infrastructure projects in majorregions to halt from Nov 15to Mar 15to prevent pollution. This could
        impactexcavator sales, which rose 100% YoY every month in 2017. Investment in thesector from Jan-July totaled
        $1.2tn (+21% YoY), which has underpinneddemand for construction steel (China rebar price up 38% YTD). (SBB)</p>
