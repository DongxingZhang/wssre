    <p> PS (Pou Sheng) management continued to highlight its target to stabilizeprofitability in 2H17 (after
        non-recurring adjustments in 1H17). We havegrowing confidence in 2H17 margin stabilization thanks to cleaner
        channelinventory, a new franchisee policy by Nike, and the revamp of outlet stores. ForYY (Yue Yuen), we believe
        investors will be encouraged by its commitment tounlocking value. We believe YY may have land assets previously
        used asproduction plants in China. We reiterate Buy on both names.<br/><br/>
        Clean channel inventory: We believe PS not only cleared obsoleteinventory on its book (retail stores) but also
        helped its franchisee clearinventory during 1H17. Optimized inventory conditions, plus controlledprocurement
        from brands, should give PS significant flexibility to optimizeits retail discount in 2H17, in our
        view.<br/><br/>
        Recruiting franchisee for Nike: We believe Nike has gradually allowed theuse of franchisees by its key
        wholesalers in China (PS being one). Thisshould boost PS¡¯s wholesale revenue (which carries a higher EBIT
        marginthan retail, in our view).<br/><br/>
        Revamping outlets: Nike and Adidas will likely allow PS to redecorate itsoutlets in 2H17. This should not only
        help increase the turnover of offseasonproducts but also enhance a lucrative earnings stream for PS. Nikeand
        Adidas may even launch products specifically designed for outlets.<br/><br/>
        This should further boost PS¡¯s gross margin, in our view.<br/><br/>
        In addition to a solid recovery in production efficiency, management¡¯scommitment to creating shareholder value
        should encourage long-terminvestors. We believe YY likely holds land assets (old factories that have shutdown
        production) in China. How YY management is going to unlock the valueof its land may drive more share price
        upside.<br/><br/>
