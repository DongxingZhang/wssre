    <p> Sailing against the wind<br/><br/>
        While Wangsu¡¯s 1H17result was broadly in line with its profit guidance, thiswas helped by an exceptionally low
        tax rate. The 2Q result suggests aworsening trend: revenue excluding the CDNetworks acquisition fell 5%
        QoQ,gross margin fell 3ppts QoQ and operating costs rose sharply such that grossoperating profit fell 56% YoY.
        With the company continuing to be buffeted bycompetitive headwinds from large cloud operators, we see limited
        signs of aturnaround in the near term; retaining Sell.<br/><br/>
        Conference call feedback<br/><br/>
        Highlights of the results conference call held on 23August included: 1) the Julygross margin continued to slide
        but the trend improved slightly from 2Q; 2) thecompany seems to be shifting its focus to IDC businesses, which
        are lower inreturn and higher in capex intensity; 3) CDNetworks contributed RMB150m inrevenue in 2Q and a 1ppt
        improvement in gross margin (hence worsening theunderlying gross margin trend); and 4) the company believes that
        it is holding onto its market share (by volume), with bandwidth usage growing 30% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Potential upside scenarios?<br/><br/>
        While Wangsu¡¯s participation in China Unicom¡¯s mixed ownership is aconfidence booster, operationally we see
        limited competitive benefits, given thatits largest competitors are playing more important roles in the same
        reformprocess. M&amp;A; also offers potential upside, but with Wangsu still trading at 34xFY17E EPS, we believe
        that valuation is not sufficiently appealing as yet.<br/><br/>
        Earnings, valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        We reduced earnings forecasts by 16-20% to reflect the weak 1H17underlyingresults and reduced our target price
        accordingly. We value Wangsu at the midpointbetween our peer-based P/E valuation and DCF (WACC 7.5%, TGR
        1%).Risks relate to market share, tax rate, regulation and margins (details on Pg 6).</p>
