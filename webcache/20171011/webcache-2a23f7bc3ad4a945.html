    <p> After the typhoon, some VIPs delayed trips from Sept to Oct¡£<br/><br/>
        For the first 10days of Sept, Macau GGR was only MOP6.8bn, according toconsultant estimates. Even with two
        weekends, MTD GGR was only MOP680m/day, down from MOP731m/day in August. On this run-rate, Sept GGR would onlybe
        11% yoy, down from 20% yoy in August. While in line with DBe (10-12%yoy), early Sept's sharp slowdown is below
        market expectations (15-17% yoy)as the Street underestimated the typhoon impact. As explained in our
        report"Typhoon impact may linger on for weeks, 28Aug", we heard that some VIPshave canceled their Sept trips
        after the typhoon, opting to come in Oct instead.Consultants estimate that MTD VIP GGR was down 10% mom while
        Mass GGRwas down 5-6% mom. Looking ahead, we expect Oct Golden Week to be strongas it has 8days this year (vs
        7days last year). Our top picks areWynn Macau (Buy)andMGM China (Buy).¡£</p>
