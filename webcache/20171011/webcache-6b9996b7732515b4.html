    <p> Last Friday, UK¡¯s Prime Minister, Theresa May, set out a two-year post-Brexit transitional plan during her
        speech in Florence, seeking to keep UK in the EU by extending the status quo until 2021. However, the speech
        provided few details on other key issues, such as the explicit amount that the UK would pay for the ¡°exit bill¡±,
        or the solution to the Irish border. Moreover, regarding the post-Brexit end-state, dissent is still notable, as
        the UK demanded a bespoke free-trade deal while the EU ruled out any optimal halfway between EEA and Canada
        models. Looking forward, the process remains complicated with deadlock risks still presenting, but the Florence
        speech demonstrated a much softer stance from the UK, which significantly reduced the risk of ¡°no-deal¡±
        scenario. Thus, in our view, the Brexit outcome has become less uncertain; and with the transition period, both
        UK and EU will have more time for agreement on / ratification of new trade deals.<br/><br/>
        Specifically, on the exit bill, although avoided explicit numbers, May went further than ever before, committing
        the UK to the current EU budget throughout the transition period until 2021 to meet UK's past financial
        commitments. Moreover, she even suggested program-based ongoing contributions to the EU budget after the
        transition period. Currently, the EU has outlined a net legacy payment of EUR 60 billion by the UK. But May
        departed from the legalistic approach in her Florence speech, by suggesting that the EU payments will depend on
        reaching a transitional deal, and the ongoing EU budget contributions should serve as an ¡°associate membership¡±
        fee. In our view, the EU has an incentive to accept the proposal, as it will face a financial shortfall without
        it.<br/><br/>
        On EU citizens¡¯ rights, we see the most important concession made during the speech. Specifically, the EU
        demanded that the rights of the 3 million EU citizens in UK to remain overseen by the European Court of Justice
        (ECJ), even after Brexit. The UK previously rejected that outright; but now, May opened the way to a compromise.
        She suggested the citizen rights agreed in the exit treaty to be enforceable in the UK courts, allowing to
        ensure their rights to be protected by a solid legal guarantee. Moreover, May accepted that future ECJ case law
        would be taken into account by UK judges, to make sure the interpretation of EU law by the ECJ will remain. In
        our view, these two steps combined should be enough to make the EU drop demands for direct ECJ
        jurisdiction.<br/><br/>
        On the Irish border, May also expressed UK¡¯s willingness to take the responsibility. As the fourth formal round
        of Brexit negotiations will start this week, we see positive signs from the UK side, which could be a mover to
        the somewhat stalled negotiations. The EU will seek further clarification on the above issues, and we remain
        optimistic that the legacy issues will be solved in 4Q and Brexit negotiations will move on in coming
        months.<br/><br/>
        However, for the future trade deals, which is the most complex part of the negotiation, we still see significant
        dissent between UK and EU. May explicitly rejected a future relationship based on the EU-Canada free trade deal,
        as the tariff barriers would be detrimental; and urged the EU to be "creative" and shape a new economic
        relationship not based on any current trade models. Although the EU previously ruled out bespoke trade deals
        with UK, we do not see it as impossible, considering that the existing non-EU models of Norway / Switzerland /
        Canada are all tailor-made deals. For the end-state, we expect the UK to strike a deal close to the EEA model,
        as only the EEA mode offers access to the EU financial services passport, which allow financial institutions to
        operate across the EU under a single license. Considering the financial service sector¡¯s importance in the UK¡¯s
        economy, losing the financial passport could be a big loss for UK.<br/><br/>
        Finally, on the BoE side, we see increased odds for a rate hike in the near term. As the transition period
        reduced the risk of exiting with no-deal, and provided two more years of time for agreement and ratification,
        the short to medium term risk is now more balanced. Thus, we expect that the BoE¡¯s will hike the rate to curb
        inflation in the coming months.</p>
