    <p> Summary<br/><br/>
        The FOMC has been signaling for some time that it will announce next week thecommencement of its balance sheet
        normalization program as described in somedetail following the June FOMC meeting. We assume the reinvestment
        taperingwill begin on October 1. We expect the Committee will also signal via its economicprojections ¨C the SEP
        ¨C and in Yellen¡¯s commentary during the press conferencethat it still anticipates raising rates one more time
        this year so long as incomingdata support its projections for inflation and growth.<br/><br/>
        Fedspeak in recent weeks and months has indicated increasing uncertainty on thepart of Committee voters about
        the need for another rate hike this year. Negativesurprises in consumer price inflation data for five months
        running had led someto question the advisability of tightening policy further at this point. However,signs that
        the inflation data may be getting back on track with this week¡¯s CPIrelease for August should damp the impulse
        to downshift the policy path at thispoint. A comfortable majority of current voting FOMC members would still
        seemto support another rate hike this year so long as inflation data continue to holdup in the months just
        ahead.</p>
