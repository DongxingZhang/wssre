    <p> iPhone X specs, pricing and shipping datesare largely in-line.<br/><br/>
        Apple launched Apple Watch 3, Apple TV 4K, iPhone 8/8 Plus and iPhone X on 12 Sept, with specs generally in line
        with our expectations. We are impressed by iPhone X's upgrade in: 1) faster A11 processor (neural engine), 2)
        super Retina OLED display, 3) glass/stainless steel casing, 4) 12MP dual-cam with dual-OIS, 5) new TrueDepth
        camera for faceID/AR/ 3D, 7) new stereo/ waterproof acoustics, 6) fast/wireless charging. iPhone 8/8 Plus will
        start shipping on 22 Sept with price at US$699, while iPhone X will be available for pre-order from 22 Oct and
        start shipping from 3 Nov with price from US$999.<br/><br/>
        AAC, FIT, Tongda, Cowell will benefit from content growth.<br/><br/>
        We believe key beneficiaries on iPhone 8/8 Plus/X content upgrade include AAC (stereo/waterproof acoustics), FIT
        (fast/wireless charging), Tongda (waterproof LSR) and Cowell (front-cam miniaturization). For AAC, we expect it
        to maintain its leadership with 55% share allocation in advanced acoustics (vs 40%/10% for Goertek/Merry), with
        an upside in 4Q17 on better ASP/share allocation. For FIT, we believe it will benefit all iPhone¡¯s adoption of
        fast/wireless charging, with upside from faster penetration in Android camp ahead. For Tongda, we expect the
        company to gain share with better ASP, with 10%+ of FY17E revenue from Apple (vs 2% in FY16). For Cowell, we
        think iPhone X¡¯s new TrueDepth camera depth will require Cowell¡¯s front-cam upgrade in selfie
        quality/miniaturization.<br/><br/>
        Accumulate on any correction following launch.<br/><br/>
        We expect strong upgrade demand for iPhone 8 given lack of major spec changes in the past two years and
        lower-than-expected pricing of new iPhone X. We see upside in our estimates of 50% iPhoneXshipment mix.Given
        limited surprise from launch event and 40%+ YTD rally of Apple supply chain, we expect heavy profit-taking
        pressure right after product launch. However, we believe new features/form factor in iPhone X should bode well
        for a strong replacement cycle in 2H17E. We recommend investors to accumulate on any correction for selective
        Apple plays.</p>
