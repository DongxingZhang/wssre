        Downgrade mining from benchmark to underweight: we upgraded miningbenchmark in mid-June (see our report Market
        Overview, June 2017), as ourmodels were pointing to upside for the copper price on the back of the reboundin the
        China credit impulse (a key driver of the PMI) and a weaker USD. Over thepast three months, the sector has
        outperformed by around 20% on the back of15% rise in the copper price, making it the best performing European
        sector overthe period. However, our model now points to renewed downside for copperand, as a consequence, we
        downgrade mining from benchmark to underweight。<br/><br/>

        There's been enough going on in markets over the last 18hours to keep my mindoff the stresses of the weekend
        ahead. In fact there was a fairly fascinating middlefew hours of the day yesterday with the BoE surprising on
        the hawkish side,US inflation higher than expected, North Korea trying to grab back the spotlightand halting the
        rise in yields, Mr Trump publicly haggling with Democrats onDACA deal, which is apparently ＾fairly close￣, and
        as the European day ended,Mr Carney admitting he was one of those leaning towards a hike as prices weregoing up
        due to a weaker currency.。<br/><br/>

        The two main strands of conversations I had on returning to the office yesterdaywas a) how tired I looked and b)
        whether I was buying the new iPhone X. Withouteven knowing what features it has Apple had me at "new i.....".
        Actually someoneasked me if I was buying the new iPhone 8instead and I was actually a littleoffended. I'm still
        dreading the day they get into cars. Regular readers will beaware how much I hate spending money on cars.
        However there would be a realrisk of personal bankruptcy if and when the iCar comes out and updates itselfevery
        year.。</p>
