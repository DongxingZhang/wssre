    <p> Yield: CEA recorded a 0.2% YoY passenger yield decline in 1H17 with3.9% YoY drop in international flight yield,
        partially offset by 1.5% YoYgrowth of domestic yield, mainly due to the aggressive launch of
        longhaulinternational routes in the past few years, which led to yield pressure,in our view. Going forward,
        management expects better yield trends amidbetter demand-supply balance on international routes. Based on
        August'sforward booking, the overall international yield decline narrowed YoYwhile domestic yield remained
        stable.<br/><br/>
        Capacity: CEA aims to further optimize its capacity with 9.6% 2H17passenger capacity (ASK) expansion, comprising
        8.8% growth fordomestic routes and 12.8% growth for international routes. Goingforward, the airline will further
        add domestic capacity on routes withhigher demand and better yield by switching to wide-body aircrafts.
        Forinternational routes, CEA will likely focus on increasing frequency andimproving passenger yield. Meanwhile,
        the airline plans to further reducecapacity for the Korean market due to low demand.<br/><br/>
