    <p> EM should remain in a sweet spot as long as DM inflation is low ¨C even if corecentral banks continue to move
        toward balance sheet reduction. EM growth haspicked up with the global cycle. We expect EM assets to benefit
        mainly from lowvolatility at such low yield levels.<br/><br/>
        Lower inflation is biding time for EM central banks. We expect Brazil to cut ratesto 7.0% and Russia to 8.0%
        this year. We expect South Africa to deliver two morecuts of 25bps. In Asia, low inflation is providing some
        central banks with room tocut rates further, while others likely delay rate hikes until 2018.<br/><br/>
        In China, The Communist Party will hold its 19th Party Congress on October18. The new group of leaders will set
        the growth target for 2018 at the CentralEconomic Working Conference in December. Our baseline is for growth to
        slowmoderately in H2, with risks tilted to the upside.<br/><br/>
        We position for continued USD weakness but favoring TRY, RUB, BRL, MXN,IDR and INR across carry trades on
        currency-specifics and reduced sensitivity toglobal drivers. Across low-yielders, sell USD/PEN and keep long CNH
        vs. SGD,THB, TWD, and short PHP .vs. the USD.<br/><br/>
        Keep short-end receivers in Brazil, Mexico, Russia (mosprime), and add inColombia. Reduced monetary ¡°premium¡±
        but still benign inflation and volatilitybackdrop favor better carry &amp; roll in the bellies of Mexico,
        Russia, South Africa,Peru, Poland and Hungary.<br/><br/>
        Tight monetary policy for longer in Turkey supports further inversion. Keepduration exposure in India,
        Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and Romania and swap spreads in Singapore and HK rates vs. US. Strong
        technicals andexternal backdrop are supportive, but credit valuation is very tight. We remainmarketweight
        overall and favor LatAm credits over EMEA and Asia. OverweightArgentina, Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, and
        Mongolia; underweight Poland,Hungary, and Sri Lanka.</p>
