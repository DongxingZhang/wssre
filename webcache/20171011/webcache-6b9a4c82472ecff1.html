    <p> Buy CRSC, HOLI, and Zhuzhou CRRC¡£<br/><br/>
        We have marketed our rail FITT report "A change of track - switch fromconstructors to equipment suppliers" dated
        31July in Singapore, Hong Kong,China, and Europe. We had the opportunity to talk to 100+ investors via
        meetingsor calls. While most investors agree with our thesis, there are some frequentlyasked questions from
        investors. In this note we summarize them, with ouranswers. Bottom line: we think the rail equipment sector has
        reached an inflectionpoint and is poised to rerate in the coming two to three years. Top picks: CRSC,Hollysys,
        and Zhuzhou CRRC.</p>
