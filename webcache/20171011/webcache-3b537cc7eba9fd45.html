        ECB ¨C Tell ¡®em what you¡¯re going to tell ¡®em, tell ¡®em, then tell ¡®em what you told ¡®em. Mario Draghi has that
        presentation formulasorted. Yet in this era of transparent central bank communication, when the first leg starts
        weeks before the actual ¡°tell ¡®em¡±stage, surprises on the day are rare. So, surprise, surprise, the ECB expects
        to unveil its quantitative easing exit next month. Andthe euro¡¯s exchange rate is ¡°very important¡± for growth
        and inflation. Beyond words, the numbers were only moderatelysurprising. The ECB cut its 2019core inflation
        forecast to 1.5per cent and left 2018output growth unchanged at 1.8per cent,from 2.2per cent this year. With no
        nasty surprises, investors yesterday resumed their euro buying frenzy. Stopping them mightrequire Mr Draghi
        ditching his favoured presentation formula to surprise markets in October.<br/><br/>

        Treasury yields ¨C History often repeats but doesn¡¯t always rhyme. Eye-catching bond market moves this week sent
        ten-yearTreasury yields to their lowest since President Trump¡¯s election. Amid the rally, the ten-year and
        two-year yield differentialplunged to a decade-low 75basis points. A similar yield-curve flattening last year
        also culminated with the 2s-10s at 75basispoints in July. But whereas that move saw yields on both maturities
        fall sharply, this year¡¯s flattening sees two-year yieldsvirtually unchanged. Why? As last year¡¯s economic scare
        began, the two-year yield was 65basis points above the Fed funds rate.Investors cut this spread in half as they
        priced out future Fed rate hikes. Now, two-year yields are already approaching the Fedfunds target rate implying
        minimal future rate hikes are anticipated. The yield should only drop further if investors startconsidering
        interest rate cuts.</p>
