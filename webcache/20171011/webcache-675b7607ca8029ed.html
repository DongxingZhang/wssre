    <p> Retail price declined from Rmb1550/bottle in July to Rmb1330-1350in the past two weeks in both Shenzhen and
        Shanghai. This is likelymainly due to increasing supply from Moutai from August 15andimplementation of 30% sales
        on the e-commerce platform policy. Theretail price of other customized Moutai which the company didn't enforcea
        price control kept rising. For example, the 350ml Moutai's retail priceincreased from Rmb1000/bottle in January
        to Rmb2000/bottle currently.Sales volume: The Shanghai distributor indicated that it has used up itsfull year
        procurement quota in 2017, and is currently beginning to usethe 1Q18quota. This implies that the distributors'
        actual sales volumein first nine month has achieved its full year target. To recap, Mr. WangChonglin, director
        of Moutai group sales company, said that the companywould sell 5600tons Feitian Moutai and 600tons of customized
        Moutaibetween 8/15to 9/30.。<br/><br/>
        Channel stockings: The Shanghai distributor believed there are somedemands from channel restockings, especially
        for private owneddistributors and wholesalers. However the Shenzhen distributor indicateda different current
        purchase behavior - with consumers typically buyingMoutai in cases, while normally buying Moutai in bottles - we
        think thisalso implies consumers are stocking up.。<br/><br/>
        Impacts from "restricting drinking liquor" policy from some localgovernments announced recently. Both Shenzhen
        and Shanghaidistributors feel the impact is limited, because they think 1) this is nota new regulation given
        there is already a similar regulation from 2012;2) the public sector's purchase portion is already low, which is
        less than30% according to the Shanghai distributor.。<br/><br/>
        Impacts from Moutai Cloud E-commerce platform (Moutai Yunshang).。<br/><br/>
        The distributors indicate that the real impacts will depend on how strictMoutai will monitor the sales volume on
        the platform. Though distributorsare required to put 30% of volume on the platform to sell at Rmb1299。</p>
