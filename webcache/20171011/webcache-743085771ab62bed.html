    <p> Rebound of national cement price continued. The average cement price (nationwide) increased 0.3% week on week to
        RMB325.21/tonne last week. Cement prices in parts of Jiangsu, Shanghai, Yunnan and Guizhou were up
        RMB10-30/tonne, while no major regions saw cement prices decline. Daily shipment volume in Jiangsu, Shanghai,
        Anhui and Jiangxi recovered to the normal level in early September. However, market demand in other areas was
        still relatively weak, at around 60%-80% of the normal level, due to a new round of environmental protection
        inspections and unfavourable weather such as typhoon and rainstorms. The average inventory level (nationwide)
        decreased to 64.19%.<br/><br/>
        Coal prices increased slightly. The comprehensive average price index for Bohai- Rim Steam Coal (Q5500K) was up
        RMB1/tonne to RMB580/tonne last week. The index was up 12.6% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.<br/><br/>
        Temporary production suspension of TCCI¡¯s Yingde plant should benefit CR Cement in the short term. TCCI
        [1136.HK; NR] announced that during the early hours of September 10, the main voltage step-down substation
        equipment at its Yingde plant caught fire. There were no injuries or casualties but the entire plant suffered
        from power interruption and was temporary incapable of production. As TCCI¡¯s Yingde plant accounted for about 8%
        of Guangdong¡¯s clinker capacity, its temporary suspension should benefit CR Cement [1313.HK; BUY] and Anhui
        Conch [914.HK; HOLD] in the near term. In particular, about 30% of CR Cement¡¯s clinker capacity is located in
        Guangdong. (Note: For the analysis on the merger between CNBM [3323.HK; HOLD] and SINOMA [1893.HK; NR], please
        refer to a separate note published today.)Cement stocks under coverage up 1% on average. Best performer Anhui
        Conch rose 3% last week. BBMG [2009.HK; HOLD] was the weakest among our coverage stocks, which dropped 2%.</p>
