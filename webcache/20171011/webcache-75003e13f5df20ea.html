    <p> The Bank of Japan (BoJ) will hold its monetary policy meeting this week on September 20th - 21st. As the
        economic growth gained momentum and deflation concerns abated for now, the pressures on BoJ to boost growth and
        inflation have reduced, but neither the recovery nor the inflation has come close to the point that deserves an
        explicit discussion of monetary tightening. Thus, we expect the BoJ to stand pat and continue with the "QQE with
        Yield Curve Control (YCC)¡±. But we noticed that BoJ¡¯s net government bond (JGB) purchases have been falling this
        year under the more flexible YCC framework, which, in our view, signaled a quiet retreat from the QE. Thus, we
        expect more policy convergence, not divergence, among the major central banks.<br/><br/>
        The 2Q GDP data confirmed that the economy has been turning towards a moderate expansion, but inflation outlook
        is way less optimistic. Supported by exports and the cyclical recovery of private consumption, the 2Q GDP grew
        by 1.4% YoY. Moreover, the annualized QoQ growth of 2.5% marked a sixth consecutive growth, which is the longest
        since 2001. Although the July industrial production and PMI data showed some slowdown into 3Q, the overall
        picture is stable, with Tankan survey showing strong confidence and the fiscal stimulus finally coming into
        effect (government demand contributed 0.3 ppts to the YoY growth in 2Q). However, inflation remains subdued,
        with headline CPI around 0.4% YoY, and core CPI around 0%.<br/><br/>
        Against such backdrop, accommodative policy is necessary to support growth and restore inflation. However, we do
        not expect more fiscal stimulus in the foreseeable future, as the unpopularity of Abe government could constrain
        the room in pushing stimulus. Thus, we have little doubt that the BoJ has to hold its ultra-loose policy for the
        foreseeable future, even if it has caused significant distortions in the financial markets. At the same time,
        however, the YCC enabled the central bank to make more flexible adjustments to its bond purchases; and what we
        see is a notable reduction of the net purchases in JGBs, without any formal announcement. The average monthly
        purchases of JGB reduced from JPY 6.6 trillion last year to 5.5 trillion this year, making the expected annual
        purchases falling from JPY 79 trillion last year to JPY 66 trillion. Looking forward, the robust demand for JGBs
        could continue, amid the heightened geopolitical tensions and the steady economic growth; thus, BoJ¡¯s implicit
        reduction in bond purchase could become the ¡°norm¡± in the future.<br/><br/>
        For the global picture, unlike last year¡¯s policy divergence among the major central banks, this year we see
        converging policies due to the restored economic growth of non-US developed economies and the fading fears of
        deflation. Specifically, BoE will probably raise benchmark rate next month; ECB could also announce adjustments
        to its asset purchase program in October meeting; and BoJ is also implicitly reducing JGB purchases. The Fed, of
        course, is still well ahead leading the tightening trend and is expected to announce to enter the last phase of
        monetary normalization, the balance sheet reduction, at this week¡¯s meeting. But the policy divergence is
        significantly reduced compared to last year. Looking forward, given the converging monetary policies and
        narrowed growth gaps, even the US tax reform may provide a boost to the US growth and rate hike outlook, we do
        not expect the dollar to rise significantly as it did in 4Q16.<br/><br/>
        In sum, we expect BoJ to stand pat in the foreseeable future, but the implicit reduction of the JGB purchases
        signaled gradual convergence of monetary policies among the major central banks. Looking forward, as both gaps
        of US-Japan growth and US-Japan monetary policy divergence are expected to narrow, we see limited downside for
        the yen, even considering the Fed¡¯s balance sheet reduction and the likely December rate hike. So, we maintain
        our forecast on USD/JPY at around 112 at the end of the year.</p>
