    <p> We believe tight policy on Shanghai homes on commercial land use rights hasbeen priced in; new launches to be
        4Q17heavy<br/><br/>
        Over the first seven months of the year, Powerlong attained RMB10.63bn ofcontract sales, up only 23% YoY,
        underperforming the China property HYsector simple average of 36%. Powerlong¡¯s management believes they
        canachieve their 2017contract sales target of RMB20bn, despite its 8M17lock-inratio being only 60.4% vs. its
        full year target. In 2H17, the developer plans tohave about RMB17.5bn of new saleable resources. Furthermore,
        the keylaunches will be residential and commercial saleable resources in Hangzhou,Ningbo and Haikou, and new
        launches should lead to solid contract sales inthe remainder of the year. Having said that, its 2H17contract
        sales should be4Q skewed (e.g., its Haikou project is slated to be launched in Dec).<br/><br/>
        We like Powerlong¡¯s growing recurrent income<br/><br/>
        In 1H17, the company¡¯s rental and management fees grew by 38% YoY toRMB0.85bn. Management guides for a 26% YoY
        growth in full year rental andmanagement fees for 2017, which would be a similar growth rate as in 2016.In 2H17,
        Powerlong plans to open Shanghai Wujing Powerlong Plaza, HuaianPowerlong Land, and Fuyang Powerlong Plaza, of
        which the first two alreadyopened in July and have occupancy ratio of over 90%. We believe<br/><br/>
        Powerlong¡¯s growing recurrent income provides a potential buffer against apossible slow-down in commercial
        property sales. Completed properties heldfor sale remained stable HoH at RMB11bn at end-June.<br/><br/>
        Manageable landbanking in 1H17<br/><br/>
        Powerlong acquired six projects in China with attributable land premium ofRMB5.6bn (see Fig 4) in 1H17. It also
        made a small investment in a NewJersey project in U.S. with another developer Landsea. Although we do notrule
        out Powerlong might add some overseas exposure in the future, thecompany will continue to focus on China
        property and we expect overseasassets to be a small portion of total only. We expect Powerlong to post anegative
        net operating cashflow of about RMB2bn for full year 2017.<br/><br/>
        Diversified fund channels continue<br/><br/>
        In August, Powerlong managed to issue RMB1.0bn of on-shore MTNs with acoupon of 6.8%; and there is still
        RMB2.0bn of unused quota for on-shoreMTNs, which we welcome. Its average funding cost continued to edge downfrom
        2015¡¯s 7.55% to 2016¡¯s 6.18% to 1H17¡¯s 6.09%.<br/><br/>
        Upgrade Powerlong 5.95% 2020s from Hold to Buy on the back of constructivevaluations and our belief that
        Shanghai tightening measures are priced inWe upgrade Powerlong USD300mn 2020s (ask price: 100.25, YTM:
        5.85%,Z+426bp) from Hold to Buy. This 3-year bond is rated B2/B- by Moody¡¯s/S&amp;P.Compared; to TPHL 6.25%
        2020C19s (issue rating of B2/B/B+ byMoody¡¯s/S&amp;P;/Fitch) which trade at ask price 103.125(with ask YTM:
        4.83%and Z+328bp), Powerlong¡¯s bond provides a Z-spread pick up of almost 100bpwith a maturity of six months
        after Times¡¯. Downside risks include harsherthan-expected policy or further tightening in commercial property,
        slow-downin cash collection ratio, and aggressive landbanking.</p>
