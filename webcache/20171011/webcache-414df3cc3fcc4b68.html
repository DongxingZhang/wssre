    <p> EMEA Fixed Income - still attractive? Despite the strong performance already seen across EM Fixed Income this
        year, variables for EM Fixed Income have not yet deteriorated enough to become concerned on risk-rewards in
        local assets. In fact, we argue that the improvements on inflation dynamics and the supply outlook as well as
        higher term premium offset the now richer valuation. We remain constructive on our asset class and see further
        room for an outperformance in H2-17. Nevertheless, we should also not ignore the deterioration in some variables
        - particularly ¡°positioning. (For more on variables and valuation in EM Fixed Income please see our latest EM
        Fixed Income Scorecard - September 2017)<br/><br/>
        Favourite positions: We highlight in particular Russia and Poland as our favourite positions while we are more
        cautious on FI in Turkey and keep a close eye on developments in South Africa.</p>
