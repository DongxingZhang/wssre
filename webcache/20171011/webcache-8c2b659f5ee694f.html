        Chine bank - Debt-to-equity swap: a deep-dive into 71cases。<br/><br/>
        Since the guidelines on banks¨ debt-to-equity swap (DES) were released a yearago, roughly Rmb1tr DES contracts
        have been signed. As the majority of theequity conversions targeted industrial SOEs, this Rmb1tr made up c.5%
        ofindustrial SOE debt. The implementation seems rather slow, however, withonly c.10% of projects completed.
        Overall, we do not expect DES itself to be alarge-scale event, reflecting its case-by-case nature and lukewarm
        demandfrom both outside investors and target companies. As such, the impact onbanks¨ capital and earnings should
        be quite limited. Over the longer term, weview DES as a supplementary measure to the real reform package on
        SOEs.(Hans Fan, 85222036353)。<br/><br/>

        Far East Horizon - Takeaways from hospital corporate day: increasing visibility。<br/><br/>
        We attended the FEH corporate day to hear hospital operational updates, andmanagement elaborated on the progress
        and long-term strategy of its hospitalbusiness. We are upbeat on the vision and execution of this
        sensiblediversification and expect hospital gross profit share to rise from 2% in 2016to8% in 2019. We
        particularly like its 1) professional team, 2) cost synergies, and3) location strategy (starting from lower-tier
        cities). As of June, it had 26hospitals with 10,000beds with plans to increase to over 50,000beds in thefuture.
        We lift the P/E multiple we apply to its hospital business from 20x to30x; this now accounts for 9% of our SoTP
        valuation. New TP HK$8.8. Buy.(Jacky Zuo, 85222036255)。<br/><br/>
