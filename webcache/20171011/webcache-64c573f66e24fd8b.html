    <p> Last Friday the HKSFC released the aggregate short positions data for September 1. Weanalysed which companies
        may be vulnerable to short-selling activity, based on the followingthree criteria: (i) the net change in short
        positions between August 25 and September 1;(ii) short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the
        absolute amount of short positions.<br/><br/>
        We must emphasize this is only an objective quantitative analysis based on officialdata; the analysis does NOT
        imply that we feel uncomfortable with the corporategovernance or fundamentals of some companies. Based on the
        results of our analysis,we believe SmarTone (0315.HK), China LNG (0931.HK), Zoomlion (1157.HK) and IGG(0799.HK)
        require close monitoring, based on their latest short positions outstanding. On theother hand, we note that
        short positions in China Evergrande (3333.HK), Tian Ge Interactive(1980.HK) and Li &amp; Fung (0494.HK) have
        dropped significantly.<br/><br/>
        Short positions in SmarTone, China LNG, Zoomlion and IGG increased significantly.<br/><br/>
        As Figure 1 shows, the short positions in SmarTone and Zoomlion rose 42.3% and 29.1%,respectively, during the
        week ended September 1. The outstanding short positions wereequivalent to 7.99% and 7.69% of their free float.
        We believe the increase in short positionsin SmarTone is related to its lacklustre FY17 results (down 16% YoY).
        Based on daily datafrom the HKEx last week, newly opened short positions remained high last week,
        representing24%-45% of the daily turnover. For Zoomlion, the increase in positions is related to concernabout a
        potential slowdown in 2H17, in our view. For details, please refer to our companynote dated September 4 (report
        link). We highlighted the increase in short positions inChina LNG and IGG in our research note last week, and
        short positions in the two continuedto rise during the week ended September 1, which deserves closer monitoring.<br/><br/>
        Significant decline in the number of short positions in China Evergrande, Tian GeInteractive and Li &amp; Fung.
        Short positions in China Evergrande, Tian Ge Interactive and Li&amp; Fung dropped 26.8%, 22.7% and 19.8%,
        respectively, during the week ended September1 (Figure 2). For Tian Ge Interactive, the decrease in short
        positions may suggest someshort sellers took profits after the release of an unfavourable research report. The
        sharpreduction in short positions in Li &amp; Fung were likely driven mainly by its better-than-expected1H17
        results (up 6.1% YoY on an adjusted basis).<br/><br/>
        Review of ideas last week. We highlighted the surge in short positions in China LNG andIGG last week, and their
        share prices dropped 3.8 and 2.9%, respectively. We also mentionedthe decline in short positions of ZhengTong
        Auto (1728.HK) last week, and the shareprice rose 4.4%.<br/><br/>
        Recap: Source of data. The HKSFC releases the aggregate short positions in all eligiblestocks every Friday with
        a delay of one week. The HKEx releases the data on short-sellingactivity on a daily basis (without a one-week
        delay), but investors do not know whether theshort positions are covered or not later. Therefore, the usefulness
        of the HKSFC data is thatit provides the outstanding short positions in each stock, and investors can trace the
        netchange on a weekly basis. However, there are still some limitations, as this data set cannotcover
        short-selling activity using OTC derivative products.<br/><br/>
        Three angles to analysing the data. (i) The net change in short positions between August25 and September 1; (ii)
        short positions as a percentage of free float; and (iii) the absoluteamount of the short positions.</p>
