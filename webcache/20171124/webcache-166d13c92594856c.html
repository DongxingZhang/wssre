    <p> Construction Machinery: 2018sector outlook ¨C promising outlook driven by increasing salesvolume and
        ASP<br/><br/>
        We believe profitability improvement will be a key sector theme in 2018. Chinese constructionmachinery
        manufacturers are showing a competitive advantage over overseas manufacturers. Weexpect outperforming
        manufactures can continue to outperform in 2018. We expect machines soldduring the 2010-2012peak to be replaced
        gradually, a trend that will continue in 2018. Meanwhile,steady FAI growth in urban infrastructure, property and
        mining should bring extra momentum.Utilization has continued to rise even with an exponential increase in
        machinery sales volume,suggesting that downstream demand for construction machinery remains robust. Lonking our
        toppick.<br/><br/>
        Financial Leasing: 2018sector outlook ¨C NIS to remain a concern in 2018<br/><br/>
        Under the pressure of narrowing NIS as market interest rates continue to increase while the Chinaeconomy slows
        moderately, we remain positive on leasing companies with diversified businessoperations such as Universal
        Medical and Far East Horizon. In addition, aircraft leasing is still anattractive sub-sector given its long
        lease durations, the large proportion of prepaid interest,predictable cash flows, relatively stable lease rates,
        and given the security deposit aircraft leasingcompanies hold even if airlines default. Our top pick is
        Universal Medical.<br/><br/>
        China Insurance Sector: 10M17life premiums update; maintain Positive rating<br/><br/>
        We think Ping An¡¯s increasing agent number and new product releases designed to satisfy theNo.134Document will
        support life premiums growth next year. Meanwhile, Oct FYPs for China Life,CPIC and NCI might be weak
        temporarily due to an adjustment to the preparation for a seasonalsales campaign in early 2018. We have a
        positive outlook on the China life insurance sector given:<br/><br/>
        1) there is now a better-regulated life insurance business environment; 2) life insurance companiesmay benefit
        from the rising 750D-MA 10Y government bond yield; and 3) a tax-deferred pension planwould be long-term positive
        for the China insurance sector.<br/><br/>
        Utilities: 2018sector outlook ¨C focus on subsectors benefiting from policy support<br/><br/>
        We estimate that urban natural gas sales volume will grow at a CAGR of 15% during 2H17-2019.We believe that wind
        power operators are not particularly inclined to increase investment at themoment, and expect newly installed
        capacity in 2018to come in flat with this year. Biomass powergeneration and hazardous waste treatment are
        showing strength, while water treatment PPP projectsare driving new sewage treatment demand. We expect low-cost
        solar power grid-connection to beachieved around 2020, and we are positive on the upstream polysilicon materials
        industry.</p>
