    <p> Earnings momentum weakened due to more working days and cost burdenKorean non-life insurers reported 3Q17
        earnings of KRW504, down 10% y-o-y. Webelieve earnings momentum weakened due to loss ratio deterioration given
        moreworking days, unfavourable weather conditions and higher expenses fromintensifying competition, leading to
        heavier excess deferred amortization cost (DAC).<br/><br/>
        On a more positive note, insurers¡¯ investment profit grew 10% y-o-y on the back ofsteady investment asset growth
        (+8% y-o-y) and rising market rates limitinginvestment yield decline (-8bps y-o-y). Still, we highlight that all
        non-life insurers havealready exceeded 2017 profit targets on the back of stronger LT risk loss ratioimprovement
        and rising market rates positively impacting investment yields. Weprefer Dongbu (005830.KS) and Hyundai M&amp;F;
        (001450.KS) as we expect a strongerearnings rebound at second-tier players given a low base and higher gearing
        to thelong-term re-pricing cycle. See risks on page 4.<br/><br/>
        SFM pushes back the capital management plan announcement to NovemberSamsung F&amp;M;¡¯s management commented that
        the group will announce a tangiblecapital management plan in mid-November. Although delayed, the CFO
        indicatedthat the basic direction is to enhance shareholder return and SFM is finalizing themid-term target for
        dividend payout and share buyback details. We flagged previouslythat investors are increasingly pushing for a
        long-term commitment on both the sharebuyback programme and dividend payout target mainly because its affiliate
        SEC iscarrying out a proactive shareholder return policy and SFM did not carry out a sharebuyback in 2016. Since
        SFM is the best-capitalized insurer and its solvency ratioshould record well in excess of 200% even under
        tighter standards; we believe SFMhas room to enhance shareholder return.</p>
