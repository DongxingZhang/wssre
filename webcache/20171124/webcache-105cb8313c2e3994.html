    <p> Capacity expansion and online initiative on track. TAL Education has beensuccessfully expanding its foot print
        by: 1) fast-learning center capacity expansion, and2) online education initiatives. From February to August 2017
        (1HFY18), TAL added 2knew classrooms, compared to the full-year high-end guidance of 4k additions. Thecompany
        guides that capacity expansion in the next 2 to 3 years will still be 30-50% y-o-y,which should support top-line
        growth in the long run. Investment in online educationcontinues to bear fruit. In 2QFY18, the online course
        enrolment accounted for 30% of totalenrolment and grew 200% y-o-y. The initiatives, although likely to drag down
        margins andASP in the short run, should fuel growth in the long term.<br/><br/>
        Revenue beat but miss in margin. TAL¡¯s revenue came in at USD456m in 2QFY18(ended August 2017), up 68% y-o-y, 4%
        higher than our expectation and consensusestimate. Quarterly student enrolments were up over 100% y-o-y to 2.2m,
        driven primarilyby summer promotions in small classes and online courses. Gross margin declined 5pptsy-o-y, of
        which 1) 2ppts was due to capacity expansion, 2) 1-1.5ppts due to onlinepromotions and summer promotions, and 3)
        1.5-2.0ppts due to incremental loss from theacquired Shunshun Bita (overseas consulting business). Sales and
        marketing expensesincreased 35% q-o-q due to increasing headcount as well as more marketing andpromotion
        activities. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin declined 4.5ppts y-o-y to17.5% in 2Q. We expect the margin to
        decline 1.5-2.0ppts in 3Q primarily dragged by lossfrom Shunshun. No promotions will take place in the coming
        quarters. We estimateFY18e non-GAAP operating margin to decline 1.4ppts y-o-y, followed by a 1.9pptrecovery in
        FY19e as Shunshun should enter the mature stage. The company guides thatthe utilisation rate will likely improve
        from early 2018. Deferred revenue grew 57% y-o-y,of which deferred revenue from small classes grew by 60-70%
        y-o-y. 2Q non-GAAP netprofit came in at USD71, 4% lower than consensus. TAL¡¯s mid-range revenue guidancefor
        4QFY18 is USD414m, implying 59% y-o-y growth, largely in line with consensusestimate. Some seasonal factors have
        impacted the 3Q guidance as only 67.5% of thefirst semester¡¯s revenue would be recorded in 3QFY18e (Sep-Nov
        2017), versus 70.2%in 3QFY17.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Buy with a new TP of USD35 (from USD28.33). We lower our FY18/19eEPS estimates by 13%/3%, but increase
        FY20e EPS by 8% as we fine-tune ourrevenue and margin assumptions for FY18-20e. Our DCF-based TP is raised
        toUSD35, primarily due to the change in earnings estimates. Our new TP implies a 42xFY19e ex-cash PE against a
        62% three-year EPS CAGR in 2017-20e. Downsiderisks include a slower-than-expected capacity expansion.</p>
