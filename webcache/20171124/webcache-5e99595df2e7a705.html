    <p> Our new issue thoughts on Xinyuan<br/><br/>
        Xinyuan announced a proposed 3-year USD bond (issue rating: NR/B-/B), withBloomberg reporting the IPT to be
        9.125% area. We see the fair value of theproposed new issue at 8.6-8.7%. Bloomberg reported yesterday that
        China¡¯sNDRC has stepped up approvals of property developers citing sources. Froman RV perspective, we see
        Oceanwide (issue rating of CCC+/B by S&amp;P;/Fitch)and Guorui (issue rating of B-/B by S&amp;P;/Fitch as comps,
        though we see highrisks of Guorui¡¯s outlook being revised to negative from stable by at least onerating agency).
        These companies all have relatively small landbank sizes andare not big in contract sales amounts, and Xinyuan
        and Oceanwide bothpossess US projects. We think Xinyuan should be trading around 30bp tighterin YTW than
        Oceanwide for the same maturity, given Oceanwide¡¯s one-notchlower difference in S&amp;P;¡¯s issue rating and much
        higher leverage despite morediversified businesses. FANHAI 7.75% 2020s trade at ask price of 98.5withYTW of 8.4%
        as we write, while GUORUI 7% 2020P19s trade at ask 98.5andYTP of 8.2%. Thus, we see the theoretical fair value
        of Xinyuan¡¯s proposed 3Ybonds at 8.1-8.2%, but after factoring a new bond concession of 50bp for newbonds in
        this high-supply market, we see the actual fair value at 8.6-8.7%.Looking at Xinyuan¡¯s own curve, XIN 8.125% Aug
        2019bonds trade at askYTM of 7.8% (Z+590bp) and XIN 7.75% Feb 2021s trade at ask price of 96.75and YTM of 8.9%
        (ask Z+692bp) as we write, implying a steep yield curve.There is about 3-months¡¯ difference in maturity in XIN¡¯s
        proposed 3-year bondvs. XIN 2021s, and assuming a 60bp difference for one-year, that would putthe proposed XIN
        2020s at a fair value yield of 8.7%. We maintain our Hold onXIN 2019s and 2021s. Upside risks include
        conservative landbanking, betterthan-expected sales and/or margins. Downside risks include
        aggressivelandbanking, harsher-than-expected policy or tougher on-shore market, andworse-than-expected sales.
