        Restrictive policies to continue; declining contract sales ahead Due to ongoingrestrictive policies,
        rapidly-rising land prices and a cyclically high contract sales basefigure in 2017 YTD, we expect most China
        developers to post declining contract sales in2018. Given tightening policies and the likely deceleration in
        contract sales ahead, wesee limited catalysts for the sector.<br/><br/>
        We prefer developers likely to exceed sales and earnings consensus Given a lackof sector-wide share price
        catalysts, we prefer developers that are likely to exceedconsensus expectations for sales and earnings in 2018.
        We also like land-owners in theGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Bay Area.<br/><br/>
        Our top picks are Gemdale P&amp;I; (535 HK, Buy) and Yuexiu Property (123 HK, Buy)Management from both companies
        believe their 2018 earnings growth outlooks havebeen underestimated by sell-side analysts. According to
        management at Gemdale P&amp;I;,its earnings may double in 2018, which would exceed current market consensus
        by40%. According to Yuexiu Property¡¯s management, its earnings may grow at least 30-40% YoY in 2018, which would
        exceed current consensus by 20%. We expect thesetwo regional state-owned developers to double their contract
        sales revenue in the nextfour years, given their premium land banks in first-tier cities and support from
        localgovernments. With stock option-based incentive schemes, management from bothcompanies are well incentivized
        to deliver solid results, in our view.</p>
