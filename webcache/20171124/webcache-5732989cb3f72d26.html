    <p> In what remains a consistent story, GeoPark continued to show productionmomentum and credit metric improvements;
        guiding for self-funded growth.<br/><br/>
        Financial results came in slightly above Bloomberg consensus (reportedadjusted EBITDA was ~3% better than
        consensus) and our forecast (adjustedEBITDA was 4% above our estimate). More importantly, in our view,
        thecompany continued its consistent deleveraging trajectory, which we expectgoing forward (as long as Brent
        prices remain at USD50/bbl or above); LTM netleverage declined to 2x from 2.2x in 2Q17 and 3.6x in 2016.
        Colombianproduction should remain the main growth driver for the company, and newself-funded guidance is
        achievable, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Steady production growth continues and year-end target has been reached.<br/><br/>
        Operationally, the company¡¯s 3Q17 production of 28.3k boed was in-line withour forecast representing 28% yoy
        growth, and the company is currentlyexceeding its year-end production exit target of 30k boed.
        Colombianproduction, which comprises 79% of total production (97% of the group¡¯sliquids production), grew an
        impressive 7% sequentially (43% yoy) as thecompany has successfully exploited its sweet spot in the Llanos 34
        Block(which may represent the biggest crude oil find in Colombia in nearly twodecades). To spur further growth,
        the company has reported a successfuldrilling campaign in Llanos 34, and acquired new acreage adjacent to
        Llanos34 and was awarded a new onshore block in Brazil (Potiguar Basin).<br/><br/>
        Company saw some cost improvements in the quarter after reporting nonrecurringpressure in 2Q17; Slight FCF burn
        in quarter but liquidity positionremains strong.<br/><br/>
        The company¡¯s all-in production costs (including overhead) added up toUSD15/boe versus 16.3/boe in 2Q17. As a
        reminder, in the last quarter aboutUSD1/boe in the differential was due to road maintenance
        works/wellintervention activities/higher royalties in Colombia and non-recurringmaintenance costs in Brazil.
        Adjusted EBITDA of USD44mn was slightly aboveour forecast, representing healthy EBITDA margins of 53.3% (up from
        42.2% inin 3Q16). The company is hedging 40-50% of its production through a zerocostcollar structure that
        guarantees a minimum Brent price of USD50-USD52/bbl in 4Q17-1Q18, providing pricing stability. Following
        fiveconsecutive quarters of positive FCF generation, the company did see a slightUSD3mn burn, but mainly due to
        working capital usage and transaction costsfor its cross-border bond issuance. Post-issuance, Cash:ST Debt is
        71x andcompany should return to FCF generation in 4Q17.<br/><br/>
        FY18 self-funded growth guidance appears achievable; our estimates remainconservative but the company has a
        clear track record of hitting its targets.<br/><br/>
        The company¡¯s work program for 2018 (assuming Brent of USD50-55/bbl isconsistent with our Base Case) is guiding
        for 15%-20% production growth to31.5-32.5k boed and exiting the year at 34k boed. In order to reach this
        selffundedtarget, the company expects to spend USD100-USD110mn (with 80%+of the spending in Colombia). The
        production growth target is consistent withour forecast, but we trimmed back our capex expectations (though
        weconservatively remain above guidance). Guidance for netback per boe ofUSD20-24 implies 2018 EBITDA generation
        of USD250mn+, however ourforecast comes under this assuming higher dilution from new projects (whichdoes provide
        upside to our forecast).</p>
