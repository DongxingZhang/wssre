        Last night the FDP unexpectedly retreated from the exploratory talks on theformation of a Jamaica coalition and
        it is unlikely that the Liberals will comeback. Party leader Lindner blamed the CDU/SCU and the Greens for
        theirunwillingness to markedly modernize Germany, the Liberal¡¯s key request in theelection campaign.<br/><br/>

        There wasn't much contagion yesterday after the surprise collapse in Germancoalition talks late on Sunday night.
        Over the last couple of years negative marketreaction to political shocks has often been over before you can
        digest it fully.Examples being the Greek and Brexit referendums and the Trump election results.Although the
        German coalition talks collapsing is much lower key than theseevents, it was still interesting that the DAX was
        only negative for 1hour 16minsand that the Euro had snapped back into positive territory 37minutes earlier
        evenif it did soften again as the day progressed closing -0.49% against the dollar. TheDAX closed +0.50% (high
        to low had been as much as +1.23%) and the Stoxx600+0.67% (range 0.91%)..</p>
