    <p> A strategy for Income investors to navigate a momentum-driven environment<br/><br/>
        Given its defensive exposure, successful dividend investing is a really challenging task ina late-stage,
        story-driven bull market, which is increasingly boosted by positive economicdata and by investors¡¯ declining
        risk aversion. In the Global Dividend Investor reports inMay 2017and August 2017we addressed this challenge by
        highlighting a momentumdrivenincome strategy that focuses on dividend plays with positive upside surprises
        interms of future dividend payments. These stocks have outperformed the MSCI World ACHigh Yield by 21.2% since
        8May 2017. Moreover, this strategy is potentially attractive forvery different investors, namely High
        Yield/Income and Momentum investors ¨C normallytwo very heterogeneous groups.</p>
