    <p> Markets have been flying this year. Well, you will have noticed. We¡¯llleave our strategists to comment on the
        finer details. From aneconomic perspective, much has to do with a string of upsidesurprises to growth and
        downside surprises to inflation. Questionis: will the pattern endure in 2018? Growth looks solid
        enough.<br/><br/>
        Asian exports should cool a tad into year-end, but that now looks tobe a relatively shallow and possibly
        temporary affair. Local demand,meanwhile, is chugging along, although China¡¯s slowing housingmarket bears
        watching. The risk, therefore, lies with inflation. Sure,it¡¯s been remarkably muted, but there are a few blips
        here and therethat seem to signal price pressures will gradually climb over thecoming year. Oil is one. Pay
        heed.</p>
