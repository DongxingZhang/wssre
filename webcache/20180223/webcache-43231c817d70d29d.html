    <p> From toy manufacturing to entertainment &amp; licensing<br/><br/>
        The company is at its initial stage to transform itself into an IP licensing companyfrom a toy manufacturer. Its
        key IP, Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf (œ≤—Ú—Ú”Îª“Ã´¿«), is one of the best-known Chinese cartoon series and its newly
        launchedK12 IPs Super Wings (≥¨º∂∑…œ¿) also has gained wide popularity amongChinese kids. In 2017, Alpha had a mere
        2.9% of revenue from IP licensing,which is compared to international companies such as Hasbro°Øs 10% andeOne°Øs
        51%. We expect that figure to expand to 4.4% in 2020 and help improvethe gross margin of Alpha by ~1ppt a year.
        The licensing is not just among K12products, but also mass market products, e.g. FMCG, F&amp;B;, hotels, given
        thefame of the IPs.<br/><br/>
        Comic IPs geared to rising demand from OTT platforms<br/><br/>
        Alpha owns U17, the second largest online comic platform in China. That isgeared to the rising original IP
        demand from iQiyi/Youku/Tencent Video, whichare keen to increase original TV drama series to attract subscribers
        and lowercosts. We see comic IP-based TV dramas in China jumping to 13 series in 2017from 1-2 series in 2015-16.
        Along with regulators°Ø encouragement in contentbased on original IPs, we see growing value to quality IP
        libraries such as U17.<br/><br/>
        K12 IPs benefit from lift of one-child policy<br/><br/>
        New births in China should finally see a 3% CAGR from 2015-25E, estimated byNBS, after a chronic 1.5% decline
        since 1990, thanks to the lift of the one-childpolicy. Alpha Group, which has around 60% sales exposure in K12
        and 30% injuvenile products, will benefit directly. Based on the company°Øs plan, there will bemore K12
        educational products based on its key IPs to come. They also aim toprudently expand the IP-based indoor kids°Ø
        playground business at a low cost bypartnering with mall developers. Its home-grown IPs fit well with
        thegovernment°Øs attempt to cultivate domestic brands in culture fields.<br/><br/>
        Strategy realigned to focus on core IPs; initiate with OP<br/><br/>
        The company realigned its strategy to focus on core IPs from 2018, aftersuffering from over-diversification in
        2015-17, which has sent its valuation to atrough of 31x 18E PER (vs historical average of 42x). Our TP is based
        on a 39xPER to factor in the execution risk of its new strategy. We expect the earnings toreturn to a growth
        trajectory in 2018 with a 185% CAGR in 2017-19E, after a42% decline in 2014-17E. Initiate on the company with an
        Outperform rating.<br/><br/>
        Risks: execution risk, competition from foreign brands, over-diversification.</p>
