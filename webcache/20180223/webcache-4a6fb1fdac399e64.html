    <p> Conclusion<br/><br/>
        We downgrade Wanda Film to Neutral from Outperform as we don¡¯t think thestrong movie-going demand can fully
        digest the excess theatre supply thatwas built over the past five years. We expect Wanda Film¡¯s
        per-screenaverage revenue (PSA) to decline to RMB1.71m in 2019 from RMB1.88m in2017, the steepest decline among
        major cinema players, given its aggressiveplan to add 100-150 theatres a year. While we still consider Wanda
        Film asthe ultimate consolidator in the market, we estimate its earnings CAGR in2017-19E to decelerate to 15%
        from 31% in 2013-16, which looks lacklustrein view of its 32x 18E PER, vs the average of 41x since IPO in Jan
        2015.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Wanda Film PSA to decline sharper amid sector glut. Despite the solidmovie-going demand, we expect China movie
        industry¡¯s PSA to fall to anunhealthy level of RMB1.01m (USD156k), in 2019 after the rapid addition ofscreens.
        Within this, we expect the domestic PSA of Wanda Film to decline toRMB1.71m in 2019 from RMB1.88m in 2017 based
        on its plan to add 100-150theatres a year. That implies an annual 5% PSA decrease, compared to theprojected 0.4%
        decrease for the sector, largely due to Wanda Film¡¯s moreaggressive expansion. We thus expect the gross margin
        of its theatrebusiness to drop to 14.5% in 2019E from 17.4%/16.0% in 2016/2017E.<br/><br/>
        Looking into details of CNY box office data. Box office in the first five daysof 2018 CNY holidays reached
        RMB4.9bn, or 72% higher than 2017. Whilethis is buoyant, we see Wanda Film¡¯s market share slightly declined to
        13.0%despite its more aggressive expansion, as this demand was primarily drivenby people who had returned home
        to third- or fourth-tier cities. Its nationwidemarket share has decreased in the past five years, to 13.2% from
        14.5%.<br/><br/>
        Long-term consolidator but near-term issues linger. We remain positiveon Wanda Film¡¯s long-term position amid
        market consolidation thanks to itsunrivalled scale and group resources. Alibaba¡¯s investment, announcedearlier
        this month, will further enhance its competitiveness. However, webelieve the excessive supply in the sector will
        drag Wanda Film¡¯s earningsCAGR to 15% in 2017-19E from 31% in 2013-16.<br/><br/>
