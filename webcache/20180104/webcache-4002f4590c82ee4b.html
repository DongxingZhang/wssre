    <p> We visited iFlytek¡¯s headquarters in Hefei and hosted an AI paneldiscussion with management (GCC). The company
        shows its ambitionin the AI space and our key findings are: 1) iFlytek enjoys meaningfulshare in the China
        speech recognition market thanks to the strong base of itsiFLY speech-to-text solution and Siri-like YuDian; 2)
        the adoption of variousunmanned client support services for telecom operators, financial institutions,and law
        enforcement agencies; 3) speech recognition devices includingportable and vehicle use (Figs 3-6); and 4) the
        extension into healthcare anddriving with AI-based cognition and pixel-level image labeling abilities.<br/><br/>
        Speech recognition is one of the key ways to access AI: iFlytek utilizesexpertise in machine perception (i.e.
        speech recognition/synthesis), covering22 dialects nationwide with a success rate of 98% in 2017 vs. 60% in
        2010,to launch multiple smart devices and services for applications includingtelecom networks (10% of 1H17
        revenue), unmanned client support (5%),education (30%), Smart City (5%), etc. For example, iFlytek is
        introducing anAI-driven voice assistant to replace humans in areas such as client support fortelecom operators,
        financial institutions and law enforcement agencies,achieving better user experience with 50% less time and 30%
        more efficiency.<br/><br/>
        AI + healthcare &amp; driving to be enabled by Deep Learning (DL) extension:iFlytek recently established a
        remarkable breakthrough in AI-driven healthcareand driving with DL capabilities beyond simple speech recognition
        (Figs 7-8).<br/><br/>
        Healthcare ¨C iFlytek¡¯s medical assistant passed the ¡®2017 clinician writtenexam¡¯ with a score of 456, well above
        the qualification requirement of 360,supported by cognition and problem-solving abilities. Driving ¨C the
        company¡¯sspeech recognition technology has been widely adopted by auto brands suchas Nio, Weltmeister and VW. It
        has also ventured into image recognition withpromising results in pixel-level semantic labeling tasks.<br/><br/>
        Read-across to China robots: 90% of service robot makers in China useiFlytek¡¯s speech recognition and synthesis
        technology, which managementthinks to be a key communication intermediate between machines andhumans rather than
        touch screens in the future. We estimate the globalservice robot market to reach US$100bn by 2025E with a 32%
        CAGR in2017-25E on current low base and diversifying applications, driving thesupply chain with more complex
        functions (Global Service Robots/ AI).<br/><br/>
        +42% YoY in 4Q17 net profit based on guidance midpoint: Managementguides 4Q17 net profit to be within a range of
        -17% ~ +100% YoY, with themidpoint landing at +42% YoY. With a commitment to continuous technologyenhancement,
        the company targets to raise opex for not only R&amp;D; but alsotalent recruitment to enlarge its leading
        position in speech recognition (opex% at 45% in 9M17 vs 42%/39% in 2016/15A). In terms of respective
        businesssegments, the company expresses strong confidence that the educationsegment will outperform given higher
        penetration and visibility.</p>
