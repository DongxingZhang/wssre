    <p> Three key negative drivers reinforce USD weakness as we start 2018. These are globalmonetary policy convergence
        as other central banks play catch-up with the Fed in terms ofnormalising policy, a US tax reform that is of
        little help to the USD and on-going flatteningof the US yield curve.<br/><br/>
        Risk remain that USD may stay on the defensive, at least in the first few months of the year.<br/><br/>
        We continue to see 2018 as driven by various idiosyncratic drivers outside of the USD.<br/><br/>
        As difficult as it is, it is good risk management for Asian based exporters to hedge a portionof their USD
        proceeds, no matter how unfavorable the prevailing exchange rate is. On theother hand, Asian based importers
        have the tailwind of the weaker USD on their side, andcan afford to wait before committing to their USD
        purchases.</p>
