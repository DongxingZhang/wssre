    <p> Happy New Year to all our readers! Although it is a holidayshortenedweek, the US data docket this week is very
        busywith US ISM manufacturing survey for December (3 Jan),US ADP employment change for December (3 Jan), US
        ISMnon-manufacturing survey for December (5 Jan), Nov factoryorders (5 Jan) and most importantly, the US
        DecemberLabor report (5 Jan). We expect 250k NFP (from 228k inNov, and Bloomberg consensus forecast is at 188k
        as of 2Jan) while unemployment rate may stay steady at 4.1%. USwage growth may pick up to +0.5%m/m, +2.8%y/y in
        Dec(from +0.2%m/m, 2.5%y/y in Nov). Note that the markets arecurrently pricing in a very low probability of
        another Fed ratehike in the 30/31 Jan 2018 FOMC (with the Bloomberg WIRPputting it at an extremely low 0.8% as
        of 2 Jan 2018). Thedata docket is relatively light for the rest of the developedeconomies in the first week of
        2018, with the exception ofthe prelim Dec CPI inflation for Eurozone (5 Jan). There is noG7 central bank
        monetary policy decision this week while theFed Reserve will release its 12/13 Dec 2017 FOMC minutes(3 Jan US
        time, or 4 Jan 3am SG time). US politics could bein focus as US President Trump may continue ratcheting uphis
        commentary on Iran &amp; North Korea. In Europe, the newrules of MiFID II and MiFIR (which is aimed at
        increasingtransparency and oversight in financial markets) comes intoeffect while Bulgaria will take over the EU
