    <p> National cement prices continued to rise last week. The average cement price (nationwide) jumped 1.3% week on
        week to RMB415/tonne last week. There was an increase of RMB20-90/tonne in major regions, including Fujian,
        Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai and Xinjiang, and a decrease of RMB10-50/tonne in Henan and western Hubei.
        The short supply of cement was less serious in late December. In some regions with relatively low cement prices
        (e.g. Guangdong and Guangxi), there was a catch up in prices. The average inventory level (nationwide) fell
        further to 50.31%, which is a multi-year low.<br/><br/>
        Coal prices were stable last week. The comprehensive average price index for Bohai- Rim Steam Coal (Q5500K)
        stood at RMB577/tonne last week. The index was down 2.7% on a year-on-year basis.<br/><br/>
        Potential cement price correction in mid-January. In some coastal regions, environmental protection inspections
        led to suspension of some construction works. High cement prices also affected downstream demand from some
        concrete batching plants. We may see a correction in cement prices in mid- and late January, as inventories may
        gradually increase from the current very low level. Since the current cement prices are higher than the level in
        the past few years, a moderate correction is not bad, in our view, as it should lower the risk of government
        intervention. In addition, any correction in share prices should offer a good entry point, as we don¡¯t expect a
        sharp fall in cement prices with the inventory level remaining very healthy.<br/><br/>
