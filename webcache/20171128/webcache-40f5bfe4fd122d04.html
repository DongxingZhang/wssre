    <p> China¡¯s fintech lending sector is booming. Whilst there will inevitably be setbacksfrom tighter regulations and
        many players will fail, we are convinced that onlineofferings are a formidable threat to banks, in the vastly
        underpenetratedconsumer finance segment. We initiate coverage of the fintech lending sectorwith a positive view
        and recommend investors buy Yirendai and Qudian. Ourtarget price implies a one-year TSR of 43% on YRD and 32% on
        QD.<br/><br/>
        Consumer credit sector is under-served<br/><br/>
        Household leverage in China is low because individual savers and borrowers areunder-served by banks. This is
        partly due to a lack of consumer credit records.With rising adoption of mobile internet, fintech lenders are
        filling that gap withinnovative solutions involving short-term cash advances and instalment loans.We project
        fintech loans will register a 37% CAGR over the next 5years.<br/><br/>
        Borrower acquisition and retention are key success factors<br/><br/>
        Fintech lending companies make money by charging facilitation fees toborrowers over their platforms. However,
        despite low-cost online models,customer acquisition costs are rising and remain a significant hurdle.
        Soundcustomer retention and repeat business is therefore vital to profitability.<br/><br/>
        Funding structure is a critical determinant<br/><br/>
        P2P remains the predominant funding source. Whilst we consider this moreexpensive and prone to more regulation,
        we think strong brands like Yirendaican benefit from a stickier customer relationships. By contrast, non-P2P
        lenders,especially with proper licences, are tapping into cheaper funding sources frombanks, trusts and even the
        securitization market.<br/><br/>
        Credit risk management yet to be proven<br/><br/>
        Given limited public credit records, fintech lending platforms have utilisedunconventional data sources such as
        social media and online shopping recordsduring the credit approval process. Credit insurance and shared reserve
        poolsare also common protections for lenders. Whilst pooling unfortunately introducescredit risk for
        shareholders, the reserving rates (defined as reserves as aproportion of total principals), appear reasonable on
        our analysis and willcontinue to rise for as long as defaults remain low.<br/><br/>
        Initiate on Yirendai (YRD US) and Qudian (QD US) with OP<br/><br/>
        Yirendai ¨C We like Yirendai¡¯s focus on instalment products with longer tenure,lower APR and lower regulatory
        risk. Whilst the company is reliant on P2Pfunding, its strong brand name provides the lowest funding costs among
        P2Ppeers. Our analysis shows that YRD has the most prudent reserve policy amongthe listed fintech lenders. Our
        target price US$60implies 43% TSR.<br/><br/>
        Qudian ¨C Though Qudian started as a cash advance P2P player on collegecampuses, it ceased lending to students in
        2015while capping APR at 36%, andmoved to institutional funding in April 2017. Our analysis shows that its
        strategicalliance with Ant Financial gave several benefits, including customer flows,easier customer retention
        and superior asset quality. Our target price of US$36implies 32% TSR.</p>
