        3Q17non-GAAP net profit for JD.com came in at Rmb2.2bn, 130% ahead ofour estimate, primarily on robust margin
        expansion. Management is promisingto continue improving margin on a full-year basis over the next few years,
        andwe project FY17/18non-GAAP NPM improvement of 0.6ppts YoY each yearto 1.4%/2.0%. While JD is currently facing
        headwinds in the apparel business,with 100+ domestic brands leaving the platform, the company is determined
        torevamp the business, supported by the growing female customer base. Afteryears of investment, the company＊s
        logistic network is to cover 100% ofChina＊s counties and villages by end-2017, which should facilitate the
        rolloutof its Xintonglu/ZGB. We maintain our OP rating and target price of US$51,which is based on 1.0x FY18E
        EV/sales.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Strong earnings beat on margin expansion. 3Q17revenue increased 39%YoY to Rmb83.7bn, in line with our and the
        consensus estimates. Grossmargin improved 1.2ppts YoY and 1.9ppts QoQ to 15.5%, ahead of our andthe market＊s
        expectations. As GPM expansion trickled down, non-GAAPoperating profit grew 171% YoY to Rmb1.5bn, 40% above our
        forecast. Non-GAAP net profit came in 130% above our estimate, at Rmb2.2bn, up by asubstantial 359% YoY. During
        the 1每11Nov promotion, JD generated anRmb127bn GMV, up 50% YoY; the company is guiding to 4Q revenue
        ofRmb107每110bn (up 35每39% YoY), in line with consensus.<br/><br/>
        Margin set to improve. CEO Richard Liu is confident in delivering meaningfulmargin expansion on a full-year
        basis over the next few years. Meanwhile,JD.com will continue reinvesting excess return for future growth,
        mainly intechnology, logistics and branding. We are cautious on JD＊s 4Q17margin andforecast a 4Q non-GAAP NPM
        contraction of 0.5ppts YoY to 0.5% givenheavy promotional efforts. We project a full-year non-GAAP NPM
        expansionof 0.6ppts YoY to 1.4% in 2017and of 0.6ppts YoY to 2.0% in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Uphill battle in apparel. With more than 100domestic apparel brands leaving JDMall in 2Q每3Q17, JD saw stagnant
        apparel GMV growth in 3Q. While JD.comexpects the negative impact to continue into 4Q, management is confident
        inreaccelerating the apparel business in 1H18, driven by the growing femalecustomer base. In 3Q17, annual active
        customers increased 34% YoY to 266m,driven by increasing female users and customers from lower-tier cities.<br/><br/>
        100% logistics network coverage. As of end-September, JD operated 405warehouses with gross floor area of 9m sq.m
        (up from 335warehouses and7.1sq.m as of end-June.) By the end of this year, JD＊s logistic network will
        beexpanded to every county and village in China. We believe this will providesthe company with the advantage in
        rolling out its Xintonglu business (陔籵繚)and ZGB app (梪嶄惘), which connects mom-and-pop shops in China.Earnings
