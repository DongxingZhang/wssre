    <p> Healthy core business and spinoff of Waimai.Baidu delivered 3Q total revenue of RMB23.5bn (up 28.7% YoY), in
        line withDBe and consensus. Management guided to 4Q revenue in a range ofRMB22.2-23.4bn, implying +22-29% YoY
        growth, the midpoint of which is 6%below consensus. While excluding the impact of disposed business such
        asWaimai, etc., which amounted to revenue of RMB400mn, growth was 28-35%YoY and in line with
        consensus.<br/><br/>
        Pure search bottoming and news feed ramping up are the main drivers weexpect to deliver YoY growth of 15% and
        27% for 3Q17 and 4Q17,respectively. Management guided to USD1bn revenue for news feed, per therecent run rate.
        We estimate iQiyi to deliver RMB6.3bn and RMB5.5bn revenuein 3Q and 4Q, respectively. The sequential decline of
        RMB750mn mainlyreflects low monetization during the party congress.<br/><br/>
        Positive organic margin trend excluding the capital gain.3Q non-GAAP operating margin delivered 6ppts/4.5ppts
        ahead of DBe/streetestimates, attributed to the more efficient spending and better news feedmargin with
        improving eCPM. Non-GAAP EPS strongly beat on a one-offdisposal gain of the food delivery business. Excluding
        capital gain, EPS stillbeat consensus by over 3%. We believe 4Q non-GAAP operating marginshould be 21%, 4ppts
        ahead of market estimates due to the lesser margin dragfrom iQiyi¡¯s content spending and money-burning food
        delivery business.<br/><br/>
        Key conference call takeaways. Mobile Baidu continues to show better user engagement, with DAU/MAUratio
        improving by 2ppts and daily time spent per user up 15% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Management guided to sequential growth of 2% QoQ from 3Q to 4Q(excluding takeout business spin-off).<br/><br/>
        3Q was a strong quarter for iQiyi, fueled by the successful launch of ¡®TheRap of China¡¯ season 1 which attracted
        2.7bn views. In August, iQiyiaccumulated 78mn/116mn PC/mobile app DAUs, respectively, andincreased monthly time
        spent by 29% YoY.<br/><br/>
        Baidu launched Apollo version 1.5 with better HD map deployment andother new functions in September. The product
        upgrade and cooperationwith enterprises such as BAIC and King-Long, will provide more visibilityon monetization
        opportunities for AI. Management believes the investmentin AI will continue to be disciplined with high ROI.</p>
