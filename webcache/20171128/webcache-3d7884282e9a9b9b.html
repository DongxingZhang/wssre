    <p> Conclusion<br/><br/>
        We just concluded with the 3Q17corporate earnings results season. This hasproven to be a source of upbeat
        sentiment, with aggregate net incomeachieving our optimistic forecasts at 13.9% Y/Y growth. This was by far
        thestrongest quarter for net income growth in 2017for our coverage universe,contrasting with low-single-digit
        growth in 1Q17and 2Q17. This positiveearnings delivery strengthens our overweight view of the
        Philippines.<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        Majority met our expectations. A majority (75%) of our coverage universeturned in 3Q17earnings that met our
        above-consensus expectations. Thishelped drive overall earnings growth in 3Q17to be the best quarter for theyear
        at 13.9% higher Y/Y. This compares with 2.1% Y/Y growth in 2Q17and3.4% Y/Y growth in 1Q17. With 9M17growth now
        at 7.1% Y/Y, we think thatour 2017E net profit growth forecast of 10.4% is looking reasonable.<br/><br/>
        Property and utilities fared best in 3Q17. We were partly correct inforecasting the property sector to fare well
        during the quarter, with 3Q17netprofit growth of 15.3% Y/Y resulting in 9M17net profit growth of 13.3%
        Y/Y.Exceeding our modest expectations were the utilities sector, which had 3Q17net profit growth of 25.6% Y/Y
        that led to 12.0% Y/Y growth for 9M17.<br/><br/>
        Consumer sector fell short, but from a less worrisome area. Theconsumer sector disappointed the most with net
        profit growing by just 5.5% in3Q17. However the shortfall was driven by narrower margins, with top-linegrowth
        including SSSG for retailers coming in strong, as expected.<br/><br/>
        Poor performers poised to bounce back. We think that companies thatdisappointed in 3Q17are poised to bounce back
        in the upcoming quarterscarrying over into 2018, with issues related to margins being addressed andindications
        of a strengthening industry and macro backdrop developing. Thelatter would include positives related to a
        successful tax reform andinfrastructure roll out.<br/><br/>
