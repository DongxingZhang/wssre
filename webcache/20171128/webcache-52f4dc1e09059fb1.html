    <p> 2024s cheapest on the curve.<br/><br/>
        Bharti¡¯s bonds have performed well over the last month, tightening by 30-40bpvs. average tightening of 10-15bp
        for the rest of India IG. However, despite thiswe think there is still 15-20bps upside potential for Bharti with
        a view that itwill remain an IG credit. Over the past few quarters, it is becoming clearer thatRJio¡¯s entrance
        has affected Bharti a lot less than peers. Further, Bharti hasbeen taking advantage of the intense competition
        to strengthen its competitiveposition in India with successive acquisitions at distressed prices, the
        latestbeing Tata Teleservices. At the same time it has also deftly managed itsbalance sheet with asset sales and
        contained its leverage.<br/><br/>
        Considering our view that Bharti remains IG, we compare Bharti to some of thesmaller BBB- names in India like
        UPL and Adani Ports and see that it stillprovides ~20bp pick up. We also note that the bonds are still trading
        over50bp wide to Reliance Industries when they traded flat to each other at thetights (2025s). While we don¡¯t
        think they should trade flat now, given thestrong technicals in the space the spread should be much narrower, in
        ourview. On the curve, we think the 2024s look the cheapest on a G spread basis;hence, we maintain our Buy on
        them and maintain Hold on 2023s and 2025s.<br/><br/>
        Downside risks include a downgrade to HY or outlook change to negative, pickup in competition again, debt funded
        acquisitions / mergers, etc while upsiderisk is competitive pressures easing faster than expected.<br/><br/>
        Results.<br/><br/>
        Q2 revenues were flat qoq at INR218 billion and EBITDA actually increased by2% to INR80 billion. Operating cash
        flows were lower qoq at INR45 billion dueto lower interest income and working capital outflows (vs inflows last
        quarter)and capex came in at INR52 billion, resulting in a negative free cash flow ofINR7 billion for the
        quarter before dividends. The company has increased itscapex plan from INR200 billion to INR250 billion for FY18
        in order to accelerateits network rollout in India. Net debt (including spectrum liabilities and financeleases)
        increased from INR934 billion to INR968 billion, resulting in a slightincrease in net leverage from 2.98x to
        3.05x (annualizing quarterly EBITDA).<br/><br/>
        Segment wise, India mobile operations were weaker qoq, with revenue andEBITDA declines of 5% each. However,
        strong performance by the Africanoperations offset this with revenue and EBITDA growing 22% and 24%respectively.
        As a result, India mobile¡¯s EBITDA contribution has declined tojust 51%, a multi-year low. Within India mobile,
        subscriber growth was low at0.5% and ARPUs (-6%) continue to decline. Further, the 57% reduction of IUCcharges
        (currently 4% of consolidated EBITDA) from October will likelycontinue to put pressure on its results in the
        next quarter. Within Africa,subscribers grew by 2.4% and we have seen some stabilization in ARPUs (+5%qoq).<br/><br/>
