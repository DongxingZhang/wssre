    <p> Production/capex beat on repeat.In an environment where operational execution amongst E&amp;Ps; has struggled
        oflate, COP continues to differentiate itself, with another quarter of production/capex beats, and its fifth
        consecutive quarter of cash flow exceeding capex +dividends. While the knock on COP of late has been "what's
        next?", the realityis that steady execution and positive revisions has driven (and should continueto) a steadily
        increasing wedge of FCF and cash return to shareholders matchedby few in industry. Buy. Positive: Yet another
        beat on volumes (1,202 Mboe/d vs.<br/><br/>
        DBe 1,188 and guide of 1,170-1,210, despite ~15 Mboe/d hurricane loss), capex($1,088m vs. DBe $1,407m) and FCF
        ($288m vs. DBe $62m, post-dividend, andpre-pension contribution). Reduced FY capex guide by $300m ($4.8 Bn to
        $4.5Bn). Negative: CFO of ~$1700mm was slightly below DBe $1,825mm on higherthan expected cash taxes;
        International natural gas pricing (both Europe and Asia/ME) weaker than expected for the second consecutive
        quarter.<br/><br/>
        What To Look For On the Call.<br/><br/>
        Rising tailwinds to FCF and shareholder returns: COP revised down capexfor the second consecutive quarter ($4.5
        Bn from $4.8 Bn - and vs. $5.0Bn original guide), driven primarily by less inflation than expected inthe US
        onshore. With five consecutive quarters of FCF generation (postdividend),and regular FCF beats (+$288m vs. $62m
        DBe on 3Q, postdividend),COP continues to demonstrate an ability to generate morewith less (ie. exceed
        production expectations with less capital), a trendwe expect to continue, driving increasing confidence in cash
        return toshareholders. COP repurchased ~$970m in shares during the quarter,with guidance reiterated for ~$3.0 Bn
        in buyback during 2017, implying ~$1.0 Bn in 4Q. CFO was distorted in 3Q by the discretionary contributionof
        ~$600m to the pension fund, a decision prompted by improved rateof return vs. sitting on the balance sheet. We
        look for commentaryon expected direction of capex in 2018 and the balance of growth/shareholder return should
        excess cash continue into 2018.<br/><br/>
        Production Beat: Volume beat (1,202 ex Libya vs. DBe 1,188 Mboe/d resp)on stronger international liquids volumes
        (336 Mb/d vs. DBe 303), ledby Malaysia. US L48 oil volumes (175 vs. DBe 180) missed slightly onlarger than
        expected downtime from hurricanes (~15 Mboe/d). Look formanagement insight on leading edge cost and productivity
        trends in L48,and implications to the production trajectory heading into 2018, as well asthe possibility of
        adding incremental rigs should oil price surprise higher.<br/><br/>
        3Q17 Results: Earnings beat (adj EPS of $0.16/sh vs. DBe of $0.04/sh) was driven by higher oil production, and
        better than expected oil/liquids realizations. This was partially offset by lower international gasrealizations
        ($4.64/mcf vs. DBe $5.15/mcf).</p>
