    <p> Our top pick in the shipping space.<br/><br/>
        Three reasons: 1) The downside risk for CSET-H looks to be minimal. YTD, thestock has largely been flattish (vs.
        an average +44% for the sector and +28.7%for HSCEI) and the current 0.5x P/B is largely the historical low
        despite continuedprofitability. 2) Upside potential appears to be considerable. The tanker cyclehas likely hit
        the bottom in 3Q and is poised to recover on falling newbuilddeliveries and rising scrapping. With ROE
        recovering to 6.3%/8.2% in 2018/19E,we expect the stock to substantially re-rate in the next 1-2 years. 3) Now
        seemsto be a better entry point. Both tanker rates and its earnings have likely troughedin 3Q. With YoY rates
        and earnings momentum reversing, history suggests thatthe stock should perform strongly. We have a target price
        of HK$6.60 with 45%upside potential.<br/><br/>
        Minimal downside risk expected.<br/><br/>
        CSET's domestic crude oil (c. RMB450m NP in 1H17, long-term contracts; 38-44%GPM in the past three years), LNG
        (RMB130m NP in 1H, 20-year+ long-termcontracts, with 16% IRRs), and its JVs &amp; associates (RMB125m NP in 1H,
        COAcontracts, with stable margins) combined could bring in c.RMB1.5bn risk-free netprofit p.a. On top of it, we
        estimate 10 VLCCs and one-third of its total producttankers have been locked in profitable time-charter
        contracts. During 3Q, despitethe lowest VLCC rates since 2013 (avg US$12k/day vs. breakeven US$30k), CSETmanaged
        to remain profitable (core earnings of RMB80m) due to these locked-incontracts. The stock historically troughed
        at 0.4x P/B in 2013, when CSET posteda RMB2.2bn net loss, or -5.2% ROE. At 0.5x P/B currently, the stock appears
        tobe discounting a loss-making scenario. Given a rising proportion of contractedrevenue, we believe the chance
        of this happening looks to be extremely low. Evenassuming historical low VLCC rates for 2018, CSET should remain
        profitable, perour analysis.<br/><br/>
        Considerable upside potential.<br/><br/>
        The tanker cycle has likely already hit the bottom in 3Q, when the VLCC rate fellto US$6k/day, the lowest since
        2013. Owing to the depressed market, scrappinghas picked up (8 VLCCs or 2.4m dwt scrapped in 2H so far vs. 0.3m
        dwt in1H) and this, along with a seasonal uptick in demand and peaking out of newsupplies, has lifted VLCC rates
        to US$30k lately. Looking into the next 2-3 years,we expect the cycle to continue to improve. Newbuild supplies
        should continueto fall, while the upcoming two new regulations (i.e. ballast water and low-sulfuroil) might
        drive as much as 20% VLCC capacity out of the market starting 2018.<br/><br/>
        Currently, our 2018/19E earnings of RMB1.8bn/2.5bn (or 6.3/8.2% ROE) assumesUS$35/40k/day VLCC rates, which
        remain conservative. Assuming VLCC ratesreach US$45k/day, or the average in the past three years, CSET's
        earnings in2018E can potentially hit RMB2.4bn, or 8% ROE (i.e. 25 VLCC * profit of US$15k/day * 365 days +
        RMB1.5bn from locked-in contracts). This should warrant 1xP/B, in our view.<br/><br/>
        Position now ahead of cycle recovery.<br/><br/>
        Why? First of all, the stock has not moved at all this year, a significant laggardvs. peers as well as the
        market. Secondly, tankers have entered into the strongseason, with VLCC rates tripling in the past four weeks.
        The peak of the strongseason typically would occur in December and January, and the stock hashistorically tended
        to move with the rates. Thirdly, the trends of tanker rateshave clearly turned, both YoY and sequentially. With
        rising tanker rates and afalling comparison base, the YoY rate momentum should continue to trend up inthe next
        12 months. When this happens, history suggests that the stock wouldtypically perform strongly. Lastly, CSET-H's
        share price historically has tracked onits quarterly earnings, which has also likely troughed in 3Q. Ahead of a
        positiverate trend in the near term and a tanker upcycle in the next 2-3 years, this seemsto be an enhanced
        entry point.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks.<br/><br/>
        We use a P/B method to value shipping companies due to the cyclical natureof the shipping industry. Trading at
        0.5x P/B, CSET-H is a significant laggard vs.<br/><br/>
        its sister companies (CSH-H and Cosco Shipping Development-H traded at 1.7xand 1.1x forward P/B, respectively).
        Besides, the A-share placement announcedwould further bring down its P/B (as measured by H share). Our target
        price of HK$6.60 is based on 0.8x forward P/B, which looks conservative as we expect thecompany to make
        6.3%/8.2% ROE in 2018/19E on a cycle recovery. We maintainSell on CSET-A with a target price of RMB5.7 due to
        the rich valuation. Macro riskfor CSET-H: weaker-than-expected China growth. Company-specific risk:
        lowerthan-expected VLCC rates. CSET A-share's risks are the reverse.</p>
