    <p> Conclusion<br/><br/>
        Consensus-beating 3Q17GDP growth (+6.2% YoY) was punctuated by manypositive data points, in particular
        accelerating real wage growth, expandingcurrent account surplus and capped debt ratios. Policy-wise, higher oil
        pricesare providing fiscal room to manoeuver even as monetary policy adopts atightening bias, though rate hikes
        are only expected post-elections (GE14;<br/><br/>
        likely 2Q18). With the Ringgit on a fundamentally firmer footing and the KLCI10% off its year high (9% TSR vs.
        12mth bottom-up 1,822KLCI target), stillelusivecorporate earnings momentum is key to market recovery.
        Favouredsectors are banks, construction and logistics - whilst GLC Reform remains astructural, over-arching
        theme, renewed traction is only likely post-GE14. Bigcappicks are Tenaga, Sime, CIMB, Telekom, Hartalega,
        AirAsia and POS(M).<br/><br/>
        Impact<br/><br/>
        3Q17macro stats impress: Malaysia¡¯s 3Q GDP growth of 6.2% (consensusexpectation: 5.7%) was the fastest pace
        since 2Q14, underpinned by strengthin private consumption, net exports and a boost from the public sector (Fig
        2).The 3Q fiscal balance surprised positively with overall balance surplus (Fig 4),while double-digit export
        growth saw current account (CA) surplus expandingto 3.7% of GNI (Fig 12; 2Q: 3.0%), continuing its rebound from
        1Q¡¯s 1.7% low.<br/><br/>
        Policy reversals in progress: As oil prices remain well above both budgeted(USD52/bbl) and 1H17average
        (USD52.2/bbl), and tax collections are strong,fiscal breathing room has expanded and may be deployed ahead of
        GE14,reinforcing GDP momentum. On the flipside, CPI averaging 4% YTD (vs. 3-4% target) and rising offshore rates
        had BNM signalling shift to tightening bias¨C we appear in-line with consensus in expecting a 50bps rise in OPR
        in 2H18.<br/><br/>
        Wages, household data supportive: Private sector nominal wage growthwas sustained at 7.3% (2Q: 7.3%; Fig 9),
        while real wage growth (ex-inflation)accelerated to 3.5% (2Q: 3.3%). Household debt/GDP ratio continued
        itsdowntrend, to 84.6% (2Q: 85.6%), a six-year low. Advanced balance sheetrepair, coupled with faster growth of
        household financial assets (Fig 10) andimproving real wage growth, should buttress consumption going
        forward.<br/><br/>
        Ringgit revival, property doldrums: With recovered oil prices, fiscalrestraint, CA surplus and stabilising
        capital flows, recent Ringgit strengthappears well-supported, especially with rate hikes looming, and favours
        USDimporters like Tenaga, AirAsia, Astro (Fig 16). Rising interest rates will beanother headwind for a
        still-struggling property sector, with BNM highlightingdecade-high unsold inventory (Fig 14) record office
        vacancies (Fig 15).<br/><br/>
        Outlook<br/><br/>
        Actionable ideas are i) banks - broadly improved earnings drivers, with higheroil price to cap oil &amp; gas-led
        NPL drag, and rising interest rates to support NIMrecovery; we like CIMB, RHB; ii) construction - most upside
        for mid-caps likeEconpile, AQRS and SunCon per greatest EPS-sensitivity to order book wins;<br/><br/>
        iii) GLC Reform ¨C expect renewed momentum post-GE14re a deconstructedSime (potential partners for Sime
        Property); Tenaga (leverage optimisation,regulatory clarity), Telekom (value-creative re-merger) and POS (M)
        (crediblee-commerce execution); and iv) strong calls with traction include Hartalega,our pick for the upgraded
        glove sector, and our non-consensus UP for BAT.</p>
