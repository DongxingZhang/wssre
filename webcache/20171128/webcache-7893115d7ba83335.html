    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +5.3%. Weekly loadings up 6.1%.<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 5.3% in Week#45 (ended 11/04/2017) vs. a 6.4%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 0.9%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 6.1% YoY (versus a 2.1%
        increase in the priorweek) and increased 5.1% sequentially (vs. a 2.6% decrease in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices roughly flat at 27 c/gal. Propane up 2 c/lb to 97 c/gal.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices rose a modest 0.1 c/gal last week to 26.9 c/gal (vs its fuel valueof 21 c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand (s/d) fundamentals remain loose,ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has
        declinedfollowing the September ¡¯16 start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston.
        Starting in Q4¡¯17, we expect US ethane s/dfundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from
        thestart-up of 8 greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade
        toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue, with the premium reflecting fractionation,
        transportation and storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17 US Natural Gas price forecast of $2.93/MMBtu, weestimate
        ethane prices will likely move toward 30 c/gal by year-end ¡®17.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices rose 2 c/lb last week to 97 c/gal. While propane inventorieswere down 1% last week to 77MM bbls,
        they are 18% and 9% below their 3and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventories
        todecline due to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16 vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene down 1.4 c/lb to 26.1 c/lb. Margins down 1.0 c/lb to 9.4 c/lb.<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 1.4 c/lb last week to 26.1 c/lb (vs the October contractprice of 34.75 c/lb). Spot
        deals for November ranged from 25.75 to 26.5 c/lbwith deals for December at 26 c/lb. Average spot ethylene
        marginscompressed 1.0 c/lb last week to 9.4 c/lb as lower selling prices more thanoffset lower production costs.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forNovember delivery at 45.75-47.25
        c/lb. October propylene contract pricessettled up 1.5 c/lb at 48.0 c/lb for PG and 46.5 c/lb for chemical grade.
        Thisfollows a 7 c/lb increase in September. The 8.5 c/lb, or 21%, increase inpropylene prices in September and
        October has been driven by supplytightness due to Hurrricane Harvey which caused outages at multiple US
        GulfCoast olefins and refinieres as well as delaying a new propanedehydrogenation (PDH) unit which had been
        scheduled to start up inSeptember.<br/><br/>
        5.3% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in November..<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, CPChem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) and Sweeny, TX cracker
        (0.6% of NA ethylene capacity)remain offline as a result of Hurricane Harvey. Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#1) cracker(1.6%
        of NA ethylene capacity) and Dow¡¯s Taft, LA (#2) cracker (1.0% of NAethylene capacity) will be offline in
        November for planned turnaround work. For¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 5.2B lbs, or 6.3%,
        ofcapacity. This compares to 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16 and 3.1B lbs, or4.1%, of ethylene capacity in
        ¡¯15.</p>
