    <p> Fundamentals improving for China Grand Auto, but we see limited upside to itsnew perps.<br/><br/>
        China Grand Auto priced USD400mn of PerpC20s on Tuesday at 5.625%, vs.<br/><br/>
        IPT of 6% area that was reported by Bloomberg. We are positive on thecompany¡¯s fundamentals and expect its total
        debt/EBITDA to trend lower inthe medium-run from end-June¡¯s 6x. Already in 1H17, we saw CHGRAU¡¯sGPM improving to
        10.4% from 9.1% from 1H16 and our calculated EBITDAmargin went up to 7.3% from 5.9% in 1H16. We expect CHGRAU¡¯s
        margin tomoderately increase in 2018 YoY. The company already filed a pre-view for its3Q17 results back on the
        17th, indicating that its 9M17 revenue was up 25%YoY to RMB112.1bn, and its operating profit grew up 52% YoY to
        RMB4.2bn.<br/><br/>
        We have already seen some synergies between CHGRAU and HK-subsidiaryBaoxin, and the company continues to benefit
        from satisfactory upgradedemand and luxury demand. The new perps are trading at bid price:100.15/ask: 100.35,
        bid YTC: 5.57%/ask: 5.50% as we write and we initiate onCHGRAU 5.625% PerpC20s with a Hold rating as we see
        limited upside tothese bonds. Our fair value of CHGRAU new Perps is 5.2-5.4%, based on a1.2x perp-to-senior
        ratio of comparables in China as well as looking at otherChina perps with a high step-up structure (see later in
        this report).<br/><br/>
        Pending equity placement to be credit positive; we expect CHGRAU¡¯s new carsales growth rate to exceed that of
        the overall industry.<br/><br/>
        China Grand Auto received CSRC¡¯s approval for an equity placement of up toRMB8bn, but the share placement has
        not yet been executed. China¡¯s largestautodealer stated that the planned use of proceeds of the new perps is
        forrepayment of debt and general corporate purchase. We continue to expectChina Grand Auto¡¯s new car sales
        volume to outpace that of the industry(recall that CAAM data showed overall China registered only +2.4%
        YoYgrowth in new passenger vehicle sales volume for 9M17). We expectCHGRAU¡¯s HK-listed subsidiary Baoxin to
        achieve good car sales and itsmargin should also trend up in 2018, given decent upgrade demand and newluxury
        model launches. Brilliance BMW X3 and new 3 series are expected tobe launched in China in 2018. Jaguar Land
        Rover has introduced Range RoverVelar in Sept and may launch domestic XE model late this year. Furthermore,this
        year¡¯s M&amp;A; amount by CHGRAU thus far has been notably lower than thatof last year.<br/><br/>
        Risks.<br/><br/>
        Upside risks include stronger-than-expected margin improvement and sales,and conservative acquisitions. Downside
        risks include higher-than-expectedacquisitions, unexpected deterioration in margins, and any hiccups in
        itsannounced but not yet executed equity placement.</p>
