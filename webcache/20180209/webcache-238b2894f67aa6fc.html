    <p> Strong steel price momentum with scope for further margin expansion.<br/><br/>
        Equities remain priced for a margin contraction (vs. spot). However, as discussedin our European Steel Outlook
        2018, we see several reasons (high global pricelevels, protectionism, demand and consolidation) why margins may
        continueto stick or even expand further (which would imply further significant earningsupgrades across the
        space). Our top picks are: 1) ArcelorMittal, which looksattractive to us based on strong cash flow (9-11% FCF
        yield), valuation andadditional upside optionality; and 2) Voestalpine, which we believe has more roomfor
        upgrades, generates strong underlying CF (8-9% FCF yield) and has a lessvolatile business model.<br/><br/>
