    <p> The FOMC meeting unfolded in line with market expectations, with one more rate hike this year and three hikes
        predicted next year. Also, balance sheet normalization would continue as planned, with the accelerated limit at
        USD 20 bn per month starting from January 2018.<br/><br/>
        However, market focus of this meeting is on Fed¡¯s economic predictions, after Trump¡¯s tax reform has
        significantly gained momentum and very likely to be implemented next year. Yellen confirmed that the 0.4 ppts
        revise-up of GDP growth in 2018 was mostly due to the tax cut¡¯s impact, which is expected to boost consumption
        and investment. However, there are still uncertainties over the size of the tax package mainly due to increasing
        deficit / debt concerns. Moreover, given that the US economy is currently running close to its potential growth,
        tax cut¡¯s impact should only be short-term, as the Fed does not expect it to change long-term growth potentials.<br/><br/>
        On inflation outlook, the Fed remained cautious, without ruling out the possibility that some of the short-term
        drags on inflation could turn into long-term trend. As we have stated, the US inflation remained subdued since
        2Q this year, mainly due to the fading low base effect of energy prices, the weak wage growth and some industry
        related factors. Although most of such factors are expected to fade, but until now, such trend is still not very
        clear. So, we still believe that inflation development should be the most important factor to determine Fed¡¯s
        future moves.<br/><br/>
        So far, as the US economic momentum still remains strong, with labor market slacks diminishing and tax reform as
        an upside risk, we remain optimistic on US¡¯s economic and inflation outlook and keep our baseline case of 3-4
        rate hikes in 2018. If inflation improved significantly, 4 hikes are still possible.</p>
