    <p> Commentary for Tuesday: Friday¡®s employment report will be the highlight ofthe first week of the new year. We
        expect a continuation of the string of solidemployment data, with nonfarm payrolls (+185k forecast vs. +228k
        previously)posting solid gains, which should bolster the rationale behind the Fed¡¯s decisionto raise interest
        rates at their December meeting. In particular, we will be focusedon the wage data. As we have highlighted
        recently, the lack of robust wage growthdespite an apparently tight labor market has allowed Fed officials to
        determinethat the labor market is not overheating, allowing them to remain on a ¡°gradual¡±normalization path.
        Though we expect a solid print for average hourly earnings(0.3% vs. 0.2%), this would only keep the
        year-over-year change steady at 2.5%.<br/><br/>
        The unemployment rate (4.1% vs. 4.1%) should remain stable at its lowest levelsince 2000. This stability should
        prove temporary, however, as we expect theunemployment rate to break through 4% in the first half of 2018. This
        levelcould prove important since we recently found using state-level data that wagegrowth picks up significantly
        as the unemployment rate falls below 4%. Finally,the average workweek (34.4 vs. 34.5) should remain roughly
        steady.<br/><br/>
        The manufacturing and non-manufacturing ISMs will be the other key datareleases this week, the former released
        on Wednesday and the latter onFriday. The manufacturing ISM (58.0 vs. 58.2) is just off of September¡¯s 13-year
        high. We expect the data to show continued solid momentum givenrecent strong sentiment in last week¡¯s Chicago
        PMI as well as regional Fedmanufacturing surveys. Combined with Thursday¡¯s ADP (+185k vs. +190k)release, the
        employment component of the manufacturing ISM should helpsharpen expectations for Friday¡¯s jobs report. Friday¡¯s
        non-manufacturing ISM(58.0 vs. 57.4) should show some evidence of firming after last month¡¯s sharpdecline from
        October¡¯s decade plus high.<br/><br/>
        The remainder of the data releases this week will help forecasters fine-tune theirpreliminary estimates of
        current quarter GDP, namely December auto sales andNovember construction spending on Wednesday together with
        November factoryorders and international trade balance on Friday. Unit motor vehicle sales (17.5million vs.
        17.4) seem to have leveled off given the length of the expansion andthe passage of hurricane disruptions, and,
        as such, we expect them to remainnear the trend over the past three years. Meanwhile, construction
        spending(+1.0% vs. +1.4%) should remain elevated given continued recovery efforts in hurricane-affected areas,
        while factory orders (+1.5% vs. -0.1%) should reflectthe recent upward revisions to durable goods orders.
        Finally, we expect theinternational trade balance (-$49.0 billion vs. -$48.7) to widen slightly given lastweek¡¯s
        advance goods trade balance, which would be a minor drag on currentquarter GDP.<br/><br/>
        After a few weeks of sparse commentary from Fed officials, we get someFedspeak this week starting with the
        release of the minutes for the Fed¡¯sDecember meeting on Wednesday. Three topics will be in focus. First, we
        willbe keen to hear any additional details from their presumable discussion on howtax cuts could impact the
        economy and how the Fed should react. In a recentanalysis, we found simulations of the tax reform bill¡¯s impact
        on the economywent a long way in explaining the change in the FOMC's median forecast sincetheir September
        outlook. Second, given the lingering debate about the causesof low inflation, any additional articulation of
        viewpoints on the debate will beclosely watched. Third, with Chicago Fed President Evans¡¯s and MinneapolisFed
        President Kashkari¡¯s detailed explanations for their dissents already in hand,we will also be on the lookout for
        any evidence that other supporters of thecommittee¡¯s decision to raise rates, Governor Brainard in particular,
        were closeto wavering.<br/><br/>
        Beyond the minutes, several current and former Fed officials will be speaking onpanels at next week¡¯s annual
        meeting of economists in Philadelphia. ClevelandFed President Mester will be pulling double duty speaking on
        Friday and Saturdaypanels about the interaction of conventional and unconventional monetarypolicies,
        particularly as they relate to macroeconomic and financial stability.<br/><br/>
        Though her policy positions are well known, we will be paying attention to her firstpublic speaking opportunity
        as a 2018 voting member. On Friday, Philadelphia FedPresident Harker (non-voter in 2018) will be on an economic
        outlook panel withQ&amp;A.; On Saturday, former Fed chair Bernanke will be presiding over a panel withNew York
        Fed Vice President Simon Potter regarding central bank balance sheetsand the shortage of safe assets. On
        Thursday, St. Louis Fed President Bullard willbe giving a keynote address in honor of Allan Meltzer.</p>
