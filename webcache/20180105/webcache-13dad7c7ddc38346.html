    <p> The acquisition<br/><br/>
        Vedanta Limited through Cairn India will acquire a controlling stake inAvanStrate Inc (ASI) for USD158million
        from the Carlyle Group. Theacquisition amount consists of<br/><br/>
        (1) taking over bank debt of USD151millionfrom ASI with face value of USD299million (we assume banks are taking
        a~50% haircut),<br/><br/>
        (2) 51% equity stake of the Carlyle Group for a nominal amount,and<br/><br/>
        (3) extension of a USD7million loan to ASI. The deal is subject to lenderapproval, which is expected by Dec 31,
        so seems like a formality.<br/><br/>
        Who is ASI?<br/><br/>
        ASI is a Japanese manufacturer of glass substrates for LCD panels. It has ~700employees with operations in
        Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It had revenues of~USD169million, EBITDA of ~USD75million and net debt of
        ~USD518millionin FY2017. Corresponding numbers for 1H¡¯FY18were USD74million, USD30million and USD498million
        respectively. Per Bloomberg, peak EBITDA wasUSD357million in FY2012and the low was USD57million in FY2016.
        Carlylehad acquired its stake in 2008for around USD560million and is effectivelyselling it for close to zero
        now. It seems ASI has tried an IPO before as perReuters and the company has already gone through a local bond
        restructuring.<br/><br/>
        Rationale and concerns<br/><br/>
        Vedanta¡¯s rationale is that the acquisition provides an optionality to India¡¯ssignificant market potential for
        LCD panels used in mobile devices. While notincorrect, we note this sector¡¯s intense competitiveness, capital
        intensity andrapidly changing technology. Considering the USD158million acquisition costfor 51% stake gives us
        an equity value of USD310million. This together withASI¡¯s remaining net debt of about USD200million would give
        an EV ofUSD510million and an EV/EBITDA of 8.5x (annualizing 1H EBITDA). Muchlarger listed companies in Korea and
        Taiwan trade at multiples around 2x. Plus,this is a totally new business for Vedanta, unrelated to its existing
        businesses.However, the promoter group does have an LCD business in Twinstar DisplayTechnologies and in fact a
        news report in October 2017(Nikkei Asian Review)had even mentioned Twinstar as a potential buyer of AvanStrate.
        We are a bitconcerned that this acquisition by Vedanta could be the beginning of a largerforay into the segment.
        Hence, will look for clarity from the management onfuture plans.<br/><br/>
        Maintain Buy on the 2024s (102/102.5)<br/><br/>
        Having said all this, the purchase consideration is not material and ASI hasbeen FCF positive in recent years,
        so might not need further significantinvestments. More importantly, we are still constructive on commodities
        andVedanta is relatively cheap in the sector. It has been delivering on itscommitment to deleverage and
        simplifying the group structure. We expectmore positive rating actions in 20118(after Moody's recent upgrade).
