    <p> Liu He, who will be China¡¯s top economic policy maker over the next fiveyears, gave his first public speech
        overseas on Wednesday at Davos.<br/><br/>
        Who is Liu He?: Mr Liu He has been viewed as President Xi¡¯s top economicadvisor since 2013, when Xi introduced
        him as ¡°very important to me.¡± He is alsoseen as the designer of the supply-side reforms that were introduced
        inDecember 2015 and have had a significant impact on the commodity space. Thatsaid, over the past five years Liu
        has largely stayed behind the scenes. This is nolonger so. Last October he was promoted to the 25-member
        Politburo, the party¡¯stop decision-making body. This March, he will likely become one of the vicepremiers during
        the People¡¯s Congress. He will also be a super-regulator,because he will head the Financial Stability and
        Development Committee, whichwas created last November to coordinate all financial regulators.<br/><br/>
        The signaling effect of the speech: Wednesday¡¯s speech by Liu in Davosmarks his debut in front of the world.
        This is even more meaningful as lastyear it was President Xi who made the Davos speech. As such, we believethis
        is meant to be a clear signal that Liu will be the spokesperson for China¡¯seconomic policy over the next five
        years, and the market should hear manymore speeches and interviews from him in the future. For the Davos
        speechitself, we have five takeaways.<br/><br/>
        1. Globalization: The most important thing for Liu at Davos, we believe, is toshow China¡¯s support for
        globalization, just as President Xi did last year. Atthe beginning of his speech, Liu emphasized that China
        stood againstprotectionism and would make its financial market more accessible to foreigninvestors. Recently, we
        find that the risk of a trade war between China andthe US has been clearly rising. Thus, we believe it important
        for Liu tocommunicate well with the US president at Davos, and this might be behindthe recent rapid appreciation
        of the RMB against the US$.<br/><br/>
        2. Reform: Based on his past work, we find Liu to be a reform-mindedtechnocrat who respects the role played by
        the market. Davos is anarena for him to explain to the world China¡¯s reform and policy agendaafter the power
        transition last year. In his speech, Liu told the audiencethat a new reform push would be introduced in 2018. We
        believe it likelyto be at the 3rd Plenum this fall.<br/><br/>
        3. Policy: Liu echoed recent speeches by President Xi, who put curbing tailrisks as the policy priority this
        year. In his speech, Liu vowed to fixChina¡¯s leverage issue over the next three years, especially in the areasof
        shadow banking and local government debt. As such, we believe howfar deleveraging will go is the biggest
        uncertainty for 2018.<br/><br/>
        4. Risks: Economists always like to talk about risks. For Liu, other than thefinancial risk domestically, the
        top risk this year is the ¡°spillover effect ofmonetary policy in large countries.¡± We believe he clearly has the
        Fed in mind.<br/><br/>
        For the medium term, he lists asset bubbles, protectionism and geopolitics.<br/><br/>
        5. Themes: In his speech, Liu put quality over speed as his top macrotheme. As such, he listed sectors that
        would benefit from the theme, suchas intelligent drive, energy-efficient construction, new energy and
        sectorsrelated to consumption upgrading. Lastly, he vowed to continue supplysidereforms through cutting
        overcapacity.</p>
