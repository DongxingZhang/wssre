    <p> Steel equities continue to be volatile, driven by macro woes and commodity pricemovements. Although current spot
        conditions remain strong, we still expect costsupport to fade, and thus, European prices to fall (current spot
        conditions wouldimply further significant earnings upgrades across the space). Our top picks are:1)
        ArcelorMittal, which looks attractive to us based on strong cash flow (9-11%FCF yield), valuation and additional
        upside optionality; and 2) Voestalpine, whichwe believe has more room for upgrades, generates strong underlying
        CF (8-9%FCF yield) and has a less volatile business model.<br/><br/>
        Last week, N. European prices were up by E7 to E548 (up USD21 to USD671) andS. European prices were also up by
        E4 to E528 (up by USD16 to USD646). Priceshave risen E16 in the past three months and several European players
        still try topush for further price rises.<br/><br/>
