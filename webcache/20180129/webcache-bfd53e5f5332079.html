    <p> Global economic growth will continue to strengthen with the G20¡¯s GDP growth to rise to3.3% in 2018 from 3.1% in
        2017, driven by both consumption and investment.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, CPI inflation will speed up to 2.5% in 2018 from 2.2% in 2017 due to surgingdemand.<br/><br/>
        The quality of growth will be improved due to industrial and consumption upgrade inemerging markets. This was
        the reason why imports in emerging economies reboundedfaster than in developed countries, driving global trade
        in 2017. Global trade volumegrowth is expected to remain robust at 4-5% in 2018 thanks to strong
        demand.<br/><br/>
        Inflation is expected to rise as major central banks are exiting from monetary easingslowly to avoid hurting the
        economy and bursting asset bubbles. Commodity prices willcontinue to rise with oil inflation to be higher than
        metal inflation.<br/><br/>
        The Fed will likely hike interest rates 2-4 times thanks to solid economic growth andrising inflation. Moreover,
        the 10-year treasury bond yield may go up to 2.8% from 2.4%in 2017 with a possible peak at 3.1%. However, the
        ECB is less likely to tightenmonetary policy as output in EU countries still runs below potential output and
        inflation isnot high. Thus, the interest rate gap between the US and EU countries will widen,leading to a
        bottoming-out in the US dollar.<br/><br/>
        The PBoC may hike interest rates as well due to rising inflation, financial deleveraging,and capital outflow
        concerns. However, the interest rate gap between China and the USis expected to narrow to 1.3pp in 2018 from
        1.5pp in 2017, raising the risk of RMBdepreciation.<br/><br/>
        Fiscal stimulus policy in the US will offset tightening monetary policy, pushing upinvestment and consumption in
        the short run. High interest rates may crowd outinvestment in the long run. The current account and fiscal
        deficit may worsen, posingdepreciation pressure on the US dollar. However, this will be partly offset by
        capitalinflow due to the tax cut.<br/><br/>
        The main risk in the global economy is a rapid exit from quantitative easing policy wheninflation surges higher
        than market consensus, causing asset bubbles to burst andcurrency depreciation in emerging economies.</p>
