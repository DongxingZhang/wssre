    <p> With the February BoE approaching, pricing at the very front end of the UK curveis elevated to recent averages.
        May-18 is close to 45% priced with a full hikeby November. We see greater value in shorts further out the front
        end RecentBoE commentary has suggested little urgency to move pricing towards a hike atupcoming meetings. In
        contrast Saunders and Tenreyro's comments have pointedtowards a higher terminal rate.<br/><br/>
        It is well known that crude oil non-commercial positioning has risen to newheights, particularly in WTI, less so
        in Brent. Not often mentioned is the fact thatpositioning by producers, merchants, processors and users also
        conspired to helpoil prices move higher. Since mid 2017, commercial WTI positioning has movedfrom short -200 k
        contracts to neutral. The change is comparable to the move innon-commercial positioning over the same period,
        +263 k contracts.<br/><br/>
        Implied vol has drifted lower through H2'17 in Europe across sectors. Asdiscussed in our 2018 Volatility
        Outlook1, we expect a continuation of this regime.<br/><br/>
        These low volatility levels do however raise doubts about the viability of shortvolatility strategies in this
        environment. In our Outlook, we highlight that the volrisk premium is still very rich, also when normalized for
        the low vol regime i.e. thecurrent vol carry is expensive compared to similar regimes historically.</p>
