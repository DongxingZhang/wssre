    <p> On new product approval, we anticipate anlotinib approval within thenext 2-4 weeks, more likely before Chinese
        New Year as we estimate JCTTmight have passed on-site manufacturing inspection already, the last keyelement of
        the regulatory process. We also expect nab-paclitaxel approvalin 1H18. On MNC front, we believe nivolumab
        approval in 1Q18 wouldbe a meaningful catalyst, as the subsequent ramp-up would be watched.<br/><br/>
        We learned that AZN might have generated RMB500m for Tagrisso within9 months after approval in 2017, which
        effectively made it the mostsuccessful drug launch in China ever.<br/><br/>
        On new drug application, we highlight that 3S Bio is on track to re-fileits Ipterbin in 1H18 (or
        1Q18).<br/><br/>
        At current valuation, we anticipate most acquisitions would be accretivewhich investors would welcome. As such,
        we believe it is more likely thatexisting shareholders would approve Tide deal on Feb 12. Per HKEX rule,the
        voting result is expected by the end of that day.<br/><br/>
        NRDL benefit emerged for 3S Bio already in 4Q17, as Yisaipu andTPIAO exhibited obviously growth acceleration. We
        expect SBP andCSPC to benefit as well. Also, we remind investors that volume growthacceleration emerged for
        icotinib in 2Q17 after 54% price cut in May 2016.<br/><br/>
        We are observing increasing interests on both leaders and laggers from globalinvestors, however Asia-based
        investors are slightly more interested on laggers.<br/><br/>
        That being said, we remind investors on the following risks, 1) 4Q17 QTD hospitaldata appear weaker than
        expected; 2) further delay of regulatory approvals; 3)ongoing Jiangsu PRDL revision would send a signal, as
        street is closely watchingwhether Lipushu would be excluded. Per JS government document, all drugs thatfailed to
        enter NRDL after negotiation would be automatically taken out of PRDL.</p>
