    <p> This morning, Ronshine announced a proposed issuance of 3-year puttable 2-year USD bonds, with Bloomberg
        reporting initial price guidance of 9.25% area.<br/><br/>
        Ronshine is rated at B2/B/B+ in issuer rating by Moody¡¯s/S&amp;P;/Fitch, withnegative outlooks from Moody¡¯s
        (since Sept 2017) and S&amp;P; (since Aug 2017).<br/><br/>
        Looking at China property HY companies under our coverage, we see Xinyuan(issuer rating of B/B from S&amp;P;/Fitch,
        stable outlooks) and Guorui (issuer ratingof B/B from S&amp;P;/Fitch, with a negative outlook from S&amp;P;) as
        reasonablecomparables of Ronshine. We believe Ronshine should trade wider thanXinyuan as we see XIN as having
        lower total debt/EBITDA and higher marginsthan Ronshine, but trade tighter than Guorui. All three companies have
        roughlysimilar total debt/total capital ratios at end-June, 2017 (Ronshine: 70%,Xinyuan: 74%, and Guorui: 68%)
        but Ronshine¡¯s reported GPM was lowestamong the three for 1H17 (19% vs Xinyuan¡¯s 22%, Guorui¡¯s 46%). We
        believeRonshine has stronger sales execution in China. We expect Ronshine to traderoughly 40-70bp wider in yield
        than Xinyuan for the same maturity, given theformer¡¯s credit metrics, more aggressive landbanking, despite
        Ronshine¡¯shigher growth in contract sales and bigger GFA in landbank. As of end-June,2017, RONXIN had 76
        projects with an attributable landbank of 7.6mn sq m.<br/><br/>
        Xinyuan Aug 2019s trade at ask YTW of 8.1%, and Xinyuan Nov 2020s trade atask YTW of 8.8%, and we believe a
        theoretical Xinyuan early 2020 USD bondshould trade at about 8.3% yield. Thus, we believe the proposed
        Ronshine2021P20s with a puttable option in early 2020 should trade at fair value of8.7%-9.0% in ask yield and we
        view it more as a two-year bond given the putoption. Ronshine has much refinancing needs this year. RONXIN 2019s
        USDbonds (USD400mn) are puttable in Dec of this year; its 364-day USD150mnwill mature in June of this year, and
        it has some on-shore bonds that areputtable this year, but we expect the company to refinance or repay these
        debtwithout problem. We maintain Buy on RONXIN 2019P18s (ask price: 99.125,ask YTP: 8.0%, Z-spread: 600bp),
        given its attractive valuation for a short-datedpaper with only less than 11 months to go to the put date.
        Downside risksinclude a rating downgrade by credit rating agency, higher-than-expectedlandbanking, and
        tougher-than-expected policy. The proposed USD bonds willbe used for refinancing and Fitch has assigned B+(EXP)
        to these bonds.</p>
