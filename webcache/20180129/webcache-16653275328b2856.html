    <p> Yesterday, we detailed the downside risks to the US, Canadian and Mexicaneconomies should the US withdraw from
        the NAFTA (see "Assessing theimpact of an adverse NAFTA outcome"). However, there are two other currenttrade
        investigations that could result in an escalation of US trade tensions,particularly with China. At present,
        there is a section 301 investigation intoChinese technology transfer and a section 232 investigation into
        whether importsof aluminum and steel pose a risk to national security. The latter investigationis less
        concerning as this relates to a relatively narrow set of metal inputsthat are defense-related. Chinese officials
        have already discussed reducing steelproduction capacity although the extent of actions taken thus far are
        debatable.<br/><br/>
        Whatever the case, the US primary metals trade balance has averaged about -$3.9 billion over the past three
        months (seasonally adjusted), which compares toan overall goods trade balance that has averaged around -$67.1
        billion.<br/><br/>
        However, the section 301 investigation into Chinese technology transfer has thepotential to be far more serious
        because the US technology sector would be mostdirectly impacted. For example, the trade balance for computers
        and electronicproducts has averaged roughly -$25 billion over the last three months (seasonallyadjusted).
        Indeed, while US exports of primary metals have averaged roughly $4.2billion per month over the last three
        months, computer and electronic exportswere more than double ($9.8 billion). The public comments on the section
        301case also give an indication of the sensitivity and complexity of the issue for UStechnology firms. The
        Semiconductor Industry Association, the US InformationTechnology Industry Council, the American Bar Association
        and several Chineseorganizations submitted detailed comments to the US Trade Representative.<br/><br/>
        Clearly, there is a broad spectrum of stake holders that are highly sensitive to theoutcome of the
        investigation. The 73 public comments submitted can be foundhere:
        https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=USTR-2017-0016.<br/><br/>
        While we cannot be certain of the exact timing of various trade announcementswith respect to the aforementioned
        issues at hand, we provide a timeline forpotential announcements by assessing political and legal restraints
        with respectto NAFTA as well as the section 232 and 301 investigations.</p>
