    <p> Jio aims to cover all consumer segments.<br/><br/>
        Reliance Jio has announced a new handset bundled offer with JioPhone. It tiesin a Rs 49/month plan (unlimited
        voice, 1GB data) with the purchase ofJioPhone. Jio has also indicated 99% pop-coverage by end-CY18. Its
        previousJioPhone offer launched in Sept/2017 was Rs 153/month plan (unlimited voice,500MB data) for three years
        bundled with the JioPhone. The subscriber had topay a refundable deposit of Rs1500 for the JioPhone. In the new
        plan, Jio hassaid the said the phone will be ¡®effectively free¡¯ which we understand would besimilar to the
        previous framework of refundable deposit.<br/><br/>
        A Jiophone ¡®re-launch¡¯ was on the cards, though the plan price is lower thanexpected.<br/><br/>
        In its recent analyst meet Jio had signalled an upcoming offer on JioPhone.<br/><br/>
        The previous launch was hamstrung by supply chain constraints which limitedthe units to c6-7m. Jio indicated
        that it has worked with its vendors (Chinese)to build inventory prior to the current offer.<br/><br/>
        The launch creates a new price point for unlimited voice.<br/><br/>
        The current price point for unlimited voice on a 4G phone is around Rs150/month and around Rs 180/month for a 2G
        phone. The refundable depositcreates an affordability barrier and the lack of popular social media apps on
        theJiophone impacts the attractiveness for a consumer. However the Jiophone istargeted to first-time phone users
        and non-data users and hence the lack ofapps may not be a significant deterrent.<br/><br/>
        Sector revenue are risk in the mid-term.<br/><br/>
        In FY17 (end/march), Indian mobile revenue stood at $29 p.a. This included thepartial impact of Jio¡¯s launch in
        Sept/2017. The sector revenues are now at alevel of $27bn (annualised). Our current forecasts imply a 4-yr CAGR
        (FY17-21E)of 8.4% to reach $39bn. India currently has 1bn active subscribers and anestimated 750-800m unique
        subscribers. We estimate that non-data /lowARPU customers would account of c40% current revenue base of the
        sector.<br/><br/>
        The current offer from Jio would like bring down the revenue-table in the midtermthis consumer segment. We
        believe a lower revenue table for the sectoris a risk for both Jio and the incumbents.</p>
