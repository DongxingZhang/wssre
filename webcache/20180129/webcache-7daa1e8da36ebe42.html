    <p> We - wrongly - assumed after a slightly smaller cut than expected, Argentina¡¯scentral bank was due to a pause
        (in line with consensus) and recommended reenteringARS longs. The underperformance prior to the decision
        suggests thatmarkets may have partially anticipated the move, which suggests that today¡¯sprice action may be
        more subdued. Still, we would not recommend entering ARSlongs, since we believe this policy decision carries an
        important bearish signalfor the currency.<br/><br/>
        To recap our views on Argentina, we have favored hard currency as a coreallocation and ARS carry tactically on
        spikes. Last October we were convincedthat anchoring inflation ahead of Q1 wage settlements was a priority - to
        betempered at times by spikes in the currency to bring it closer to fair valuation. Thishad been the pattern of
        the previous year: A couple of months of range-boundtrading to reap the carry followed by a jump to a new
        plateau to erase some ofthe overvaluation of the peso.<br/><br/>
        The weight given to policy priorities seems to have changed, however. The goalof attenuating building external
        imbalances seems to have gained importanceover disinflation. By bringing rates lower despite rising inflation
        expectations thecentral bank is validating a significant drop in ex-ante real interest rates. Absenttighter
        fiscal policy and increasing private savings this is consistent with a moredepreciated real exchange rate. In
        turn, wage negotiations will also likely validatehigher inflation expectations, which will mitigate the real FX
        depreciation thatthe central bank would like to see by easing policy. Overall this means a weakernominal anchor
        and thus an inauspicious outlook for the peso.<br/><br/>
        Real rates are still quite high (near 10%) and carry could eventually become(tactically) appealing, but one
        needs first to understand how much the pendulumwill have to swing in favor of reducing external imbalances and
        away from disinflating the economy. Also, it remains to be seen whether looser monetarypolicy will be
        compensated by tighter fiscal policy.<br/><br/>
        External debt should not be immune to this change in policy. Argentina willfund the bulk of its needs locally
        and by making ARS assets less appealing toforeigners, it adds strain to an already hefty external debt issuance
        program.<br/><br/>
        Where does this leave us on the overall view on the credit? This lowering of theguard against inflation is
        certainly a negative development. After all, inflation hasoften been the linchpin of Argentina¡¯s macro
        adjustment. But anchoring inflationat the expense of substantial currency overvaluation has never been
        sustainableeither. According to our estimation, the peso is over 10% overvalued and we sawtight monetary policy
        and additional real appreciation as a temporary price topay while breaking inflation inertia. We saw current
        account deficits of 4-5% ofGDP tolerable for a couple of years given low external debt as fiscal policy
        turnedtighter - especially during the next political cycle. After all, CADs are a by-productof insufficient
        savings - not the currency. That said, this looser nominal anchorjust increases the reliance on fiscal policy.
        We would take a more cautious viewon the sovereign if it fails to respond to possibly higher inflation pressures
        downthe road with mitigating fiscal responses.</p>
