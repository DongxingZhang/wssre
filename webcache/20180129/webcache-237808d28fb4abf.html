    <p> After an eventful last week, which saw bouts of negative headlines from S&amp;Pciting; ¡°clear danger of default
        by Eskom¡± and South African exchange warningsuspension of Eskom¡¯s listed debt securities upon failure to submit
        its interimfinancial report, the weekend saw some positive developments aimed ataverting a liquidity crisis and
        addressing corporate governance issues atEskom. This involved a major overhaul of the company¡¯s management
        boardincluding an order to remove all executives facing corruption allegations. Thenew board includes
        high-profile business executives including Telkom SA SOCLtd. Chairman, Jabu Mabuza, who was named the new
        Chairman, as wellformer MTN Group CEO. Reportedly, the former South African FinanceMinister Mr. Nene was also
        considered for the Chairman post. We believe thisoverhaul of the board would help ease the corporate governance
        issues raisedby some of the lenders and pave the way for securing future fundingcommitments. According to
        Bloomberg, citing Eskom¡¯s spokesman, Eskomhas started engaging with banks to reopen previously closed credit
        facilitiesand is hopeful that South African National Treasury will support Eskom¡¯s bid toraise its liquidity
        levels to targeted ZAR20bn (USD1.66bn).<br/><br/>
        Overall, we view these developments as credit positive, which is also reflectedin the Eskom¡¯s Eurobond yields
        which dropped by 55bps since the lastThursday (see the chart). At the same time, we also caution against
        gettingcarried away and seeing this as full resolution of Eskom¡¯s challenges. Amongother things, the Company
        still needs to report its interim financial resultsbefore 31st January to avoid suspension of its listed debt
        securities on JSE.<br/><br/>
        Recall that in late December last year, the Company delayed the release of its2017/2018 interim financial
        results in order to afford itself the opportunity toreview the impact of the 5.23% tariff increase and to allow
        the newlyappointedboard members sufficient time to review the financials. Morerecently, it confirmed to release
        the financials on or before 31st January. Also,and more importantly, a full resolution of its financial woes
        would dependupon future financial discipline, mainly on cost and capex front, generatingpositive internal cash
        flows and securing sustainable funding sources for itsfuture needs without drawing upon additional government
        guarantees.</p>
