        World Steel Association (WSA) expects global steel demand to rise 2.8% YoY(vs. April outlook for +1.3%) to
        1.62bn tons in 2017and +1.6% (vs. 0.9%) to1.65bn tons in 2018. WSA sees best balance of risks since WFC.
        Chineseconsumption to be up 3.0% YoY (or 12.4% unadjusted) at 766m tons in 2017and flat in 2018, as government
        resumes its economic rebalancing efforts andstrengthens environmental protection. The US economic fundamentals
        remainrobust supported by strong consumer spending and rising businessconfidence, with demand set to rise 4.8%

        Demand for copper could be boosted by Electric Vehicles (EV), which require3-4x more copper compared to
        traditional fossil-fuel powered vehicles. Severalfactors are driving the price right now, from rising PMI¡¯s
        globally to China¡¯sstrong imports. Copper price is up 3.7% DoD to $3.24/lb. In September, Chinaimported 430kt
        refined copper (+10% MoM) and 1.5mt of copper concentrates(+2%). International Copper Association expects copper
        demand from EV¡¯s torise from 185kt today to 1.74mt by 2027, with fewer deposits beingdiscovered.
