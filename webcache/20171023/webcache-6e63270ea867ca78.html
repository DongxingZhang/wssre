    <p> Bank Indonesia meets next Thursday and we expect it to keep its policy rateunchanged. Although inflation remains
        low enough, the recent IDR depreciationis likely to convince BI to refrain from further easing, despite the
        curiously weakretail sales growth that suggests that all may not be that well.¡£<br/><br/>
        The Bank of Korea also meets next Thursday and we expect another steady ratedecision amid ongoing concerns about
        North Korea and renegotiation of theKORUS FTA, despite the likely near 3% growth and inflation of 2.3% in Q3.
        Closeattention will be paid to changes in the BoK's forecasts, to be announced the sameday. The market is likely
        to come under pressure if the BoK raises its GDP growthforecast more than 0.1ppts, while raising its inflation
        forecast by 0.2ppts to 2.1%for 2017. For 2018, the BoK is likely to leave its GDP forecast unchanged at
        2.9%,amid "high uncertainty", while raising the inflation forecast by 0.1ppt to 2%.¡£<br/><br/>
        China is likely to report a policy-led slowdown in GDP growth, to 6.6% in Q3from 6.9% in Q2, while a continued
        land market boom adds to governmentrevenue and supports the economy. We expect high frequency data like IP
        (6.5%in September vs. 6.0% in August) and retail sales (10.2% vs. 10.1%) to grow fasterin September, while fixed
        asset investment growth remains unchanged (7.8%).China¡¯s CPI inflation is likely to ease to 1.4% in September,
        from 1.8% in August,while PPI (6.4% vs. 6.3%) rises at a slightly faster pace.¡£<br/><br/>
        We expect Malaysia¡¯s CPI inflation to rise slightly to 3.8% in September, from3.7% in August, with the core at
        2.7% vs. 2.4% in the same period. In contrast,India¡¯s WPI inflation is likely to moderate to 2.9% in September,
        from 3.2% inAugust.¡£<br/><br/>
        India's trade deficit is likely to remain largely stable, at USD11.9bn in Septembervs. USD11.6bn in August,
        reflecting strong export growth (10.1% in Septembervs. 10.3% in August). Meanwhile, we expect Singapore¡¯s trade
        surplus to widen toSGD6.7bn in September, from SGD5.6bn in August, as export growth accelerates(to 16.5% from
        15.2%). Thailand is also likely to report stronger export growth(14.0% vs. 13.2%) in September, while
        Indonesia¡¯s remains robust (15.5% vs.19.2%).¡£</p>
