        In yesterday¡¯s state election in Lower Saxony, the SPD secured 36.9% of thevotes ( 2013 election: 32.6%) and
        thus defeated the CDU 33.6% (2013: 36%).<br/><br/>
        Three weeks after the poor result in the federal election, this is heartening forSPD leader Schulz and his
        party, while Chancellor Merkel has suffered anothersetback following her conservative party's weaker than-
        expected performanceat the federal level.<br/><br/>

        In a recent report published both as a stand¨Calone (see BRL ¨C Can flows pickup the baton from carry?) and as a
        special report in the latest EM Monthly(see Emerging Markets Monthly - Rebalancing Risks) we recommend
        remainingexposed to the BRL. And while in the latest FX Blueprint we had also favoredlong BRL positions, back
        then our argument was mainly driven by the currency'srelatively high carry.(see FX Blueprint ¨C People Power).
        This time however, ourrecommendation to buy BRL is driven as much by the BRL's relatively highvolatility
        adjusted values as by the improving macro fundamentals of Brazil'seconomy.</p>
