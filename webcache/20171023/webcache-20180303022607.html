    <p> We do not believe the rally today was justified by the targeted RRR cutalone. As highlighted in our report A
        neutralizing move rather than easing,we estimate the cut would release Rmb300-400bn of liquidity (only 20-25bps
        of deposits) but do not see this as an easing move, given 1) it aimsto neutralize the impact of inclusion of
        interbank CDs into MPA in 1Q18, asthe cuts will be implemented three months later and not immediately; 2) itwill
        not impact all banks and many banks have already enjoyed the RRRcut.<br/><br/>
        We would rather attribute the strong performance to improvingfundamentals and recovery from recent unjustified
        underperformance.<br/><br/>
        Fundamentally, big banks will likely record further NIM expansion and NPLmoderation as a result of (1) improving
        corporate financial health (seereport Tracking corporate financial health); (2) continued but orderlyfinancial
        deleveraging which should benefit big banks with elevatedinterbank rates (see Financial deleveraging Series I,
        II, III and IV); and (3)decent growth in consumption-driven loans (excluding the property-relatedlending) which
        should benefit retail-orientated banks (see Where didconsumer loans go). In addition, the big four Chinese banks
        hadunderperformed the Hang Seng Index by 4% in September 2017 despitethe stronger-than-expected 2Q results (see
        Quality results from qualitybanks), which we believe was due to investors¡¯ profit-taking and someworries about
        potential US sanctions. This underperformance was notjustified by fundamentals, in our view.<br/><br/>
        We have been advocating buying big banks since July 2017 (see reportTime to accumulate big banks), but staying
        cautious on JSBs. Despitepotential short-term volatility, our thesis remained unchanged, which isbuilt on the
        base-case assumption that the monetary policy stance is stillneutral. We would turn more positive on JSBs if
        easing policy stance isconfirmed or the shift in business mix toward retail segment succeeds.<br/><br/>
        For big banks we see three catalysts: 1) 3Q results by end of this month isexpected to show gradual improvement
        in NIM and asset quality; 2)stronger Southbound inflows (especially from insurance funds), given AHpremium (20%)
        and dividend yield of 5.2%; and 3) sustained corporateprofitability.</p>
