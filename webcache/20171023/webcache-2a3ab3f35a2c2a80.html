    <p> Budget 2018 themed ¡°Negaraku Shaping The Future¡± will be tabled on 27 October.<br/><br/>
        Given that this is the final budget before the next general elections, we expect an expansionary budget with
        focus on the lowerand middle income segments, addressing cost of living, affordable housing issues, and new
        technology to spur growth.<br/><br/>
        The budget will sustain the momentum of core infrastructure spending as project awards and announcements are
        reaffirmed.<br/><br/>
        Government revenues will be enhanced by broadening the tax base to include foreign digital service providers and
        increasing taxcompliance and enforcement efforts. Higher oil and commodity prices will also help buffer
        revenues.<br/><br/>
        A combination of higher revenue and targeted spending will allow the government to target a narrower fiscal
        deficit -2.9% of GDPin 2018 (-3.0% in 2017), which marks nine years of deficit reduction.<br/><br/>
        2017¡¯s real GDP growth estimate to be revised higher to 5.0%-5.5% (vs. 4.3%-4.8%) given a robust performance of
        5.7% in 1H2017. For 2018, we expect government to target a higher growth of 5.0%-6.0% (UOB: 5.0%).</p>
