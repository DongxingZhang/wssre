    <p> Headline CPI inflation surprised to the upside in September。<br/><br/>
        The yearly growth rate of CPI inflation accelerated to 0.4%, from -0.1% in August,bringing the year-on-year
        growth rate to 2.2% in September.。<br/><br/>
        Yesterday, partial details on major group categories showed prices of food,dwellings and transportation to be
        the main contributors of the yearly headlinenumber (Figure 1). Together, those three components accounted for
        more than80% of the yearly rate increase in headline.。<br/><br/>
        Unlike other countries in the region however, price pressures from actual housingrentals remain subdued in
        Poland, once corresponding CPI weights are applied.And, we note that what is pushing the share of 'housing
        costs' to take the secondplace in the ranking of pressures in Figure 1, are the 'energy sensitive' items
        we'vehighlighted in previous reports.。<br/><br/>
        Today, the print showed the 15%-trimmed mean yearly measure grew 20basispoints compared to the previous month
        and stood at 1.9%. The CPI ex-foodenergy prices rose to 1.0%, from .7% in August. Despite the up-tick in core,
        theSeptember acceleration in clothing and footwear was atypical, while increasesin health prices and education
        are unlikely to sustain the same pace of increaseseen this month. Risks remain that optimism about the economy
        and/or cost pushpressures lead price-setters to pass on increases in costs, or even increasemark-ups.。<br/><br/>
        Base effects vs renewed pressure on commodities。<br/><br/>
        Inflationary pressures increased in September and have not been helpeddevelopments in energy and industrial
        commodity prices, notably steel prices andoil prices. Our new forecast path still expects inflation to remain
        well below the2.5% target in the coming quarters, temporarily declining by the end of the yearand into 2018Q1,
        before resuming an upward trend from 2018Q2onward.。<br/><br/>
        The cumulative positive base effects from energy and food prices in 2017Q4and 2018Q1are still larger than the
        cumulative effect of the recent bumpoil prices, according to our latest estimation. This, coupled with lagged
        effectsfrom subdued import prices, implies that cost-push pressures may only stemfrom wage growth, mark-up
        adjustments, or further PLN weakness during thishorizon. The combined effect of all the above factors implies,
        on our estimates,that headline CPI inflation will still average 1.9% in 2017(as in our previousprojection),
        while we see a pick up from 1.9% to 2.0% in 2018. Risks are tiltedto the upside.。<br/><br/>
        Our assessment about the monetary policy stance。<br/><br/>
        Our assessment remains of no change in rates until end-2018. However, theSeptember print has already raised
        market pricing for hikes in H22018, althoughthis goes against the current majority of the MPC and the clear
        stance of GovernorGlapinski to remain on a wait-and-see mode.。</p>
