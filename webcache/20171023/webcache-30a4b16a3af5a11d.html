    <p> Macau¡¯s gross gaming revenue (GGR) rose 21.8% YoY to MOP67bn in 3Q17, with VIPgaming GGR growing 35.0% YoY and
        mass gaming GGR increasing 7.4% YoY. VIP gamingaccounted for 58% of total GGR in 3Q17(+1ppt QoQ). We note two
        typhoons, inparticular level-10Typhoon Hato in late August, negatively affected the industry¡¯s GGRin August and
        September, group tours from mainland China being suspended for oneweek. Nonetheless, GGR beat market
        expectations in August, while being in line withexpectations in September. We are more cautious on the gaming
        sector¡¯s growth outlookin the short-term, while remaining positive in the long run.¡£<br/><br/>
        Visitations negatively impacted by typhoons. Total visitations declined 0.56% in Augustafter growing for five
        consecutive months. As the government suspended group toursfrom 25to 30August, group visitations declined 7.0%
        YoY to 677,400. Meanwhile,individual visitations increased 1.6% YoY. Hotel occupancy rate dropped by 3.9ppts
        to86.4%, after growing for 14consecutive months. Mass gaming revenue growthmoderated by 1-2ppts QoQ in 3Q17.
        However, looking at Macau¡¯s energy supply andvisitation numbers, we note the typhoons only had a short-term
        impact, the industryresuming normal conditions before the National Day holidays (1-8October).¡£<br/><br/>
        Short-term pressure. Compared with 1H16, late 2016represents a higher base, whichwill negatively affect YoY
        growth in end-2017, while positive drivers in the sector havealready been priced in. In addition, we think
        uncertainties in the housing and commoditymarkets may affect VIP gaming revenue. However, we believe it is
        unlikely for theindustry to experience a similar downturn to the one seen in 2014in the near future.Overall, we
        suggest that investors become more cautious on the gaming sector in 4Q17.¡£<br/><br/>
        Long-term growth potential. We believe the gaming industry is still in a growing stagefor two main reasons.
        First, population penetration rate (visitations from mainland Chinadivided by total population) is still low at
        c.1.4%, compared with 10%-plus for Las Vegasin the US. Second, China is experiencing consumption upgrades. As a
        result, an increasingnumber of people are looking for ways to spend money on outbound travelling andleisure
        activities. Given its geographical location, Macau is a convenient vacationdestination for mainland tourists. We
        believe the sector¡¯s healthier business structure,with mass gaming GGR at a historically high contribution level
        and non-gaming businessdeveloping, will contribute to solid industry growth in the long term.¡£<br/><br/>
        Overweight gaming stocks. Despite being more cautious on the gaming industry¡¯sperformance in end-2017, we remain
        positive on the sector¡¯s growth outlook in the longrun, considering the potential from mainland Chinese
        visitors. The sector is currentlytrading at 12.8x 18E EV/Ebitda. We like Galaxy Entertainment (27:HK ¨C BUY) in
        the longrun, while we see opportunities in MGM China (2282:HK ¨C N-R) in the short term, as theonly gaming stock
        with new property opening scheduled in 2017-18.¡£</p>
