    <p> Key discussion on how to leverage technology for growth。<br/><br/>
        We were recently in Shanghai and Hangzhou to meet with industry counterparts,ending the trip to attend the
        investor session at the Computing Conference 2017held by Alibaba. Alongside hallway chats and coffee break with
        Alibaba andAnt Financial, we sat in on group presentations from AliCloud partners such asPhilips, Dockers and
        Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Traffic Policefollowed by Ant Financial's sessions involving the use
        of technology such as AIand biometric scanning to strengthen its position as a technology-driven
        financialplatform. For both AliCloud and Ant Financial, we walked away thinking that thereis both immediate and
        mid-term TAM expansion prospects.。<br/><br/>
        Technology improvements are broadening and deepening both now andTomorrow。<br/><br/>
        For example, Philips delved into existing relationship with AliCloud and howits current partnership was in an
        transitional stage called 'Bluebird', whichmidway between its on-premise to cloud infrastructure. We inferred
        from thediscussion that there was still room to grow in virtualization and the IaaS and thatthe relationship
        further evolve towards PaaS stack over time. Another examplewas from Zoloz that powers Alipay's eyeball
        biometric technology and howthe technology is already in use for one-third of log in with biometrics, notonly
        delivering on improved service efficacy but also enriching Ant's data pool.Increasing adoption of Ant's Zhima
        Credit by traditional financial institution seemswell underway and we received the impression it was partially
        contributing tosharp earnings growth at Ant Financial. RA repeated commentary from AliCloudpartners was
        AliCloud's reliability in both security and performance, but also theprofessionalism shown by its staff. To
        date, AliCloud has attracted one-third ofChina's Top 500enterprises with total customers reaching 1m, and the
        companyaims to further deepen and broaden industry coverage across manufacturing,finance, government bureaus,
        transportation, sports, and so forth.。<br/><br/>
