    <p> GMR Hyderabad Airport (GMRHA) printed USD350million 10-year bondovernight at 4.25% ytm. The 2027s are trading at
        100.25offer (4.2% ytm,G+190bp) as we write. They look expensive to us, however, given lack ofvisible negative
        catalysts in an overall strong market, we initiate with a Hold.We caveat upfront that we haven¡¯t yet spoken to
        the management, which hasbeen on the roadshow, so our views are based purely on secondary sources
        ofinformation.¡£<br/><br/>
        Key downside risks¡£<br/><br/>
        To start, we are a bit surprised that a small company like this got aBa1/BB+/BB+ rating, and even a positive
        outlook from S&amp;P.; Annualizedrevenues and EBITDA in the latest quarter were USD224million and USD142million
        respectively, with a total asset base of just USD564million and bookequity of USD62million. On top, the company
        has a chequered regulatoryhistory, especially in FY15when some of the fees were reduced to zero andEBITDA was a
        mere USD40million. Though the fees were restored in Nov¡¯15,it seems the Air Passengers Association has
        challenged the order. Plus, thereis some uncertainty surrounding the tariff for ongoing 5-year control
        period(FY¡¯17-21) and the ruling from AERA is expected on this in 4QFY18. Net net,we won¡¯t completely rule out
        negative headlines coming back on the tarifffront. Separately, while the starting leverage is at 2.7x (gross),
        GMRHA isabout to start the next phase of expansion for a capex of INR20-25billion(~USD300-400million) over the
        next 3-4years. We also highlight that a newinternational airport has been announced for the State of Andhra
        Pradesh(395kms from GMRHA) and two regional airports are being contemplatedwithin 150kms radius of GMRHA, and
        there is indirectly a high dependence onthe Middle East which accounts for majority of the international
        passengers.¡£<br/><br/>
        Upside risks¡£<br/><br/>
        On the positive side, we acknowledge that the underlying asset is solid with along concession period of 60years,
        witnessing strong passenger growth andjust 4% revenue sharing with the government. It¡¯s cash flows are
        welldiversified (between aero vs. non-aero revenues) and ring fenced, with minorityshareholders in the form of
        the State of Telangana and AAI, which reduces theimpact from parent, GMR Infrastructure¡¯s weaker credit profile.
        On top, thebonds are secured, albeit it¡¯s not clear if bondholders will be defined as¡°Lenders¡± under the
        Concession Agreement, and we understand that the FXrisk will be hedged.¡£</p>
