    <p> The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 3.6% in Week#1 (ended 12/30/2017) vs. a 6.6%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areflat. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US chemical
        shipmenttonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trend of broaderchemical industry
        activity and demand. The more volatile measure of weeklyloadings decreased 8.1% YoY (versus a 5.9% increase in
        the prior week) anddecreased 15.7% sequentially (vs.a 2.9% decrease in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices rose 2.1 c/gal last week to 25.3 c/gal (vs its fuel value of 19c/gal). While US ethane
        supply/demand fundamentals remain loose, ethanerejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has declined
        following theSeptember ¡¯16 start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethane export facilityin Houston. We expect
        US ethane s/d fundamentals to tighten further in 1H¡¯18driven by 600k bpd of new demand from the start-up of 8
        greenfield ethylenecrackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens, we expect ethane to trade towardits historical
        premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuel value, with the premium reflectingfractionation, transportation and storage
        costs. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯18 US NaturalGas price forecast of $3.30/MMBtu, we estimate ethane prices will likely
        movetoward 32 c/gal by year-end ¡®18.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices fell 3.9 c/gal last week to 93.4 c/gal on lower-than-expectedinventory draw. While propane
        inventories were down 1% last week to 67MMbbls, they are 18% and 8% below their 3 and 5-yr avgs, respectively.
        Longerterm, we expect propane inventories to decline due to higher exports (+17% in¡¯17 vs up 20% in
        ¡®16).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices rose 0.7 c/lb last week to 28.3 c/lb (vs the Decembercontract price of 32.5 c/lb). Spot
        deals for January ranged from 27.875 to 28.75c/lb with deals for February ranged from 27.75 to 29.25 c/lb.
        Average spotethylene margins expanded 0.5 c/lb last week to 12.5 c/lb on higher sellingprices.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forJanuary delivery ranged from 51-56
        c/lb. December propylene contract pricessettled up 1 c/lb at 50.0 c/lb for PG and 48.5 c/lb for chemical grade.
        Thisfollows a 1 c/lb increase in November, a 1.5 c/lb increase in October and 7 c/lbincrease in September. The
        10.5 c/lb, or 27%, increase in prices sinceSeptember has been driven by supply tightness due to Hurricane Harvey
        whichcaused outages at multiple US Gulf Coast olefins and refineries as well asdelaying a new propane
        dehydrogenation (PDH) unit which had beenscheduled to start up in September (but started-up three weeks
        ago).<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, Formosa¡¯s Point Comfort, TX cracker (1.7% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) was offline last
        week due to an operational upset. ShellChemical¡¯s Norco, LA cracker (2.1% of NA ethylene capacity) restarted
        lastweek after maintenance. For ¡¯18, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production lossesof 4.4B lbs, or 4.8%, of
        capacity. This compares to 5.2B lbs, or 6.2%, ofproduction losss in in ¡¯17 and 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of ethylene
        capacity offline in¡¯16.</p>
