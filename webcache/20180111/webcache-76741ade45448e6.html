    <p> Another year of polarisation in the sector.<br/><br/>
        2018 is likely to be a year where again the macro conditions are fairly unsupportivefor the European non-food
        retailers but where structural changes in the industryhave a greater bearing on performance. Retail stocks are
        typically early-cycle sowe feel more sanguine about some of the macro-exposed stocks, since these havealready
        de-rated sharply. Within a diverse, stock-picking sector we identify fiveinvestment themes, raise ASOS to a Buy
        and downgrade Carpetright to a Hold.<br/><br/>
        1) Buy the value retailers - another year when the consumer seeks out value.<br/><br/>
        We reiterate our sector top picks, which all benefit from the shift to value: ABFoods¡¯ Primark, B&amp;M; and
        Boohoo. These are high-multiple stocks, but all offerstructural growth and are well placed within the cycle.
        Primark is trading on alower implied P/E multiple than Inditex and we see greater upside potential.<br/><br/>
        2) Watch the value traps in mid-market apparel retail.<br/><br/>
        The UK clothing retail sector may have a slightly better year in 2018, with lessneed for price increases.
        However, we still see market shares shifting towards thevalue retailers, disruption from the online channel
        shift which puts pressure onmarginal profitability, and difficulties in maintaining price discipline. We have
        Holdratings on M&amp;S;, Next and Debenhams despite optically low valuation multiples.<br/><br/>
        3) Back the online brands over the platforms - superior growth and prospects.<br/><br/>
        The online apparel brands ASOS and Boohoo (both Buy-rated) are more attractiveinvestments, have more
        differentiated propositions, and can drive superior growthversus the platforms Zalando (Sell) and Showroomprive
        (Hold), in our view.<br/><br/>
        4) Skeptical of transformation stories - a difficult backdrop for a turnaround.<br/><br/>
        The sector faces macro and structural challenges. Unsurprisingly there are manytransformation stories:
        Carpetright, Ceconomy, Debenhams, Dixons Carphone,H&amp;M;, Kingfisher and M&amp;S.; These turnarounds may be
        hampered by the macrobackdrop, or in some instances we think it is too early to play the theme. Hence
        wedowngrade Carpetright, though we back Dixons Carphone on valuation grounds.<br/><br/>
        5) Buy travel at the right price - supportive macro trends in 2018.<br/><br/>
        We have long been admirers of companies within this space. Travel retail isdefensive to wider retail industry
        pressures due to structural growth in traffic ofa captive customer audience. We prefer Dufry (Buy) over WH Smith
        (Hold) froma valuation perspective, preferring the PEG of 1.0x to a PEG of 2.4x.</p>
