    <p> Moody¡¯s settles at Baa3 with negative outlook.<br/><br/>
        This is in line with our base case laid out in the initiation report on Oct 12 andsubsequently reiterated by us
        on Nov 10. We will not go through the details ofMoody¡¯s analysis. Separately, Fitch had put its BBB+ rating on
        watch negativeback in mid-Dec and we expect a maximum of 1-notch downgrade by Fitch.<br/><br/>
        So GLP should end up with a Baa3/BBB rating in the near term.<br/><br/>
        What¡¯s next.<br/><br/>
        We would expect GLP to start deleveraging to deliver on its commitment tostay IG. As the company has guided,
        this should come in one or more of thefollowing ways: divestment of 85% stake in the recent European
        acquisition,formation of development and/or income funds in China, continued disposal ofassets in Japan, etc. We
        would also like to see the company maintaintransparency with bond investors post privatization ¨C while we don¡¯t
        expectthe same standards as a listed company, this needs to be monitored. Plus, atsome point, the details of
        acquisition funding could be disclosed officially.<br/><br/>
        Note that per various press reports (including Bloomberg), the biddingconsortium is raising bank loans of USD4.1
        billion for the acquisition, withdifferent tenors. We assume the balance ~USD7.5 billion will be funded
        asequity. There is a possibility that some of the USD4.1 billion new debt is usedfor refinancing GLP's existing
        debt (especially if they have a change of controllanguage), in which case the equity contribution will be higher
        to that extent.<br/><br/>
        Per Bloomberg, the loan pricing has a rating linked pricing grid with 30-50bpstep up if both agencies take GLP
        to HY (vs. both keeping IG). On the bondtechnical, we foresee the same to improve further as the ratings
        overhang hasbeen removed for now and Chinese investors could start stepping in. In fact,GLP announced this
        morning that it has received approval from the CSRC toissue up to RMB12 billion of Belt &amp; Road bonds on the
        Shenzhen StockExchange. It will be the first company to issue such bonds in China, withproceeds to be used to
        repay debt raised for the European acquisition.<br/><br/>
        Fair value on the 2025s at 185-190bp (G+207bp offer as we write).<br/><br/>
        As argued in our past reports, we see Longfor 2022s (G+165bp, Baa3/BBB-/BBB-), Sino Ocean Land 2024s (G+180bp,
        Baa3/NR/BBB-) and Yuexiu Property2023s (G+170bp, Baa3 Neg / NR / BBB-) as possible comps. This suggests
        fairvalue on the GLP 2025s of 185-190bp, 15-20bp of potential upside from thecurrent offer level. We highlight
        that high-BBB rated Goodman Group inAustralia has its 2028s at around G+135bp.</p>
