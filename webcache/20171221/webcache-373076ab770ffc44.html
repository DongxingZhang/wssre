    <p> Singapore¡¯s non-oil domestic exports (NODX) rose 9.1% y/y in November, lower than the20.5% y/y expansion in
        October, but nevertheless, higher than market expectations of a 6.4%y/y increase. On a m/m SA basis, NODX slowed
        to an expansion of 8.7%, after October¡¯s 12.3%increase.<br/><br/>
        November¡¯s NODX expansion was driven by the growth in both electronics and non-electronicsexports.<br/><br/>
        In particular, electronics NODX expanded 5.2% y/y, higher than the 4.5% y/y growth registereda month ago, and
        was the 2nd consecutive month of increase after a decline in September. Thekey electronic segments that gained
        were the exports of ICs (+9.6% y/y), disk media products(+21.6% y/y), and other computer peripherals (+70.3%
        y/y).<br/><br/>
        Non-electronic NODX gained 10.6% y/y in November, slowing from the 28.1% y/y expansion inthe previous month.
        This could be due mainly to the slowdown in the exports of non-monetarygold to a y/y gain of 43.4%, from the
        591.5% gain registered in October. Other than that, theexports of specialized machinery (+17.1% y/y) and primary
        chemicals (+38.5% y/y) contributedmost of the growth in non-electronic exports in November. The on-year growth
        in thepharmaceuticals segment in October and November finally reversed the previous six months ofcontraction.
        However, this segment is still down 17.3% y/y year-to-date.<br/><br/>
        In November, exports to most of Singapore¡¯s top 10 NODX markets grew except to Taiwan andHong Kong. The largest
        contributors to the NODX increase were China (+27.5% y/y, mainly dueto increase in the exports of non-monetary
        gold, primary chemicals, and optical goods), SouthKorea (+34.4% y/y, due to exports of specialized machinery,
        measuring instruments, and opticalgoods), and the US (+15.3% y/y, due to exports of disk media products,
        pharmaceuticals, andother specialty chemicals).<br/><br/>
        Oil domestic exports grew 31.0% y/y, the 15th consecutive month of expansion, following a 24-month decline
        previously. Higher oil prices helped to push up the nominal value of oil exportsand higher sales in November
        were to Malaysia (+99.5% y/y), Hong Kong (+38.3% y/y) andVietnam (+65.4% y/y).<br/><br/>
        Non-oil re-exports (NORX), a gauge on the regional/global trading sentiments, increased 3.9%y/y in November,
        after a slight 0.9% y/y decline in October. The expansion was due to highershipment of both electronic and
        non-electronic re-exports. On a m/m SA basis, NORX rose 6.6%,following the 3.2% contraction a month
        ago.<br/><br/>
        Today¡¯s release of November NODX have started to show signs of the base effectskicking in., where the strong
        on-year growth rates in exports for most of the past yearmay not be sustained as we go into 2018. The chart
        below shows that the growth rate inelectronics and non-electronics NODX.</p>
