    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average +4.2%. Weekly loadings up 8.5%<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings increased 4.2% in Week#50(ended 12/09/2017) vs. a 3.1%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD areup 1.2%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings increased 8.5% YoY (versus a 4.0%
        increase in the priorweek) and decreased 6.7% sequentially (vs.a 28.5% increase in the prior week).Ethane prices
        up 3c/gal to 23c/gal. Propane down 8c/gal to 89c/galEthane prices rose 2.5c/gal last week to 22.9c/gal (vs its
        fuel value of 18c/gal)as buyers stepped back into the ethane spot market. This follows a 4c/galdecline two weeks
        ago on several delayed cracker projects and a robust buildof ethane inventory. While US ethane supply/demand
        fundamentals remainloose, ethane rejection, which peaked at 500-600k bpd in 1H16, has declinedfollowing the
        September ¡¯16start-up of Enterprise Products 200k bpd ethaneexport facility in Houston. Starting in 1H¡¯18, we
        expect US ethane s/dfundamentals to tighten further, driven by 600k bpd of new demand from thestart-up of
        8greenfield ethylene crackers in ¡¯17-¡¯19. As the market tightens,we expect ethane to trade toward its historical
        premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuelvalue, with the premium reflecting fractionation, transportation and
        storagecosts. Based on DB¡¯s ¡¯17US Natural Gas price forecast of $3.02/MMBtu, weestimate ethane prices will
        likely move toward 30c/gal by year-end ¡®17.Propane prices fell 8.1c/gal last week to 89.1c/gal, due partially to
        logisticalconstraints facing US rail exports to Mexico. While propane inventories wereroughly flat last week at
        75MM bbls, they are 17% and 7% below their 3and 5-yr avgs, respectively. Longer term, we expect propane
        inventories to declinedue to higher exports (+20% in ¡¯16vs up 12% in ¡®15, up in ¡¯17E).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene flat at 28c/lb. Margins up 0.6c/lb to 13.1c/lb<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 0.1c/lb last week to 27.7c/lb (vs the Novembercontract price of 33.25c/lb). Spot deals
        for December ranged from 27.375to28c/lb with deals for January ranged between 28.125-28.75c/lb. Average
        spotethylene margins expanded 0.6c/lb last week to 13.1c/lb on lower productioncosts.<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals forDecember delivery at 48c/lb.
        November propylene contract prices settled up 1c/lb at 49.0c/lb for PG and 47.5c/lb for chemical grade. This
        follows a 7c/lbincrease in September, and 1.5c/lb increase in October. The 9.5c/lb, or 24%,increase in prices
        since September has been driven by supply tightness due toHurricane Harvey which caused outages at multiple US
        Gulf Coast olefins andrefinieres as well as delaying a new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unitwhich had been
        scheduled to start up in September (but started-up lastweekd).<br/><br/>
        4.2% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in December<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, CPChem¡¯s Cedar Bayou, TX cracker (2.1% of North American {NA}ethylene capacity) and Shell Chemical¡¯s
        Norco, LA cracker (2.1% of NAethylene capacity) are offline last week due to operational upsets. In
        addition,DowDuPont¡¯s Freeport, TX LHC-9cracker (3.8% of NA ethylene capacity) is inthe restarting process after
        maintenance. For ¡¯17, IHS forecasts NA ethyleneproduction losses of 5.1B lbs, or 6.1%, of capacity. This
        compares to 4.5B lbs,or 5.5%, of capacity in ¡¯16and 3.1B lbs, or 4.1%, of ethylene capacity in ¡¯15.</p>
