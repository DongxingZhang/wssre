    <p> South Africa: As good as it gets (for now)<br/><br/>
        The outcome of ANC leadership election was as good as it could have been formarkets, given the set of possible
        outcomes. Cyril Ramaphosa's win has been themain focus, causing a 15-20bp rally in credit markets and 5.5% in
        the rand (inthe past two trading sessions) as the outcome went from probable to inevitable.However, the
        composition of the top 6also turns out as market -supportive forthe near term, in our view. Even if it has
        Mabuza - a Zuma supporter - as DeputyPresident, this outcome should help alleviate fears of a legal challenge /
        protestsfrom the NDZ camp. Longer term, as this signals that policy-making is likelybottoming out and the fact
        South Africa¡¯s debt could be manageable with a betterpolicy mix, we see clearly positive implications for the
        markets.<br/><br/>
        On the downside, the divisions within the top 6make it harder for Ramaphosa toget a clean break from the past
        leadership culture. New Secretary General AceMagashule is one of the more controversial in this regard. In
        addition, the CR winalso makes it less likely that Jacob Zuma will step down before the Presidentialelection in
        2019, as this would likely put him in the dock for some of the 783charges against him. Thus the dreaded status
        quo might continue for longer thanmarkets hoped. The status quo, as outlined in the medium-term budget, now
        withthe added cost of free education, bodes poorly for Moody's rating review at thestart of next year (date yet
        to be set).</p>
