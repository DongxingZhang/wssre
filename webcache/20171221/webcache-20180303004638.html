    <p> On that subject, we have a week of ¡®great expectations¡¯ ahead as the tax billfinally looks set to be delivered
        to Mr Trump before Christmas. The mood changedpretty quickly on Friday as Senators Rubio and Corker changed
        their minds andbacked the plan with the latter being the only Republican Senator not voting forthe original one.
        Then late on Friday details of the planned bill were announced. Interms of ratifying, it seems that the House
        will vote first, expected to be tomorrow,and then the Senate will vote later in the week. Now the holdouts have
        turned infavour, it does seem like a routine voting process even though the GOP may beone vote down in the
        Senate as CBS has reported that Senator McCain may notbe available for the final vote due to his recent
        illness.</p>
