    <p> Key highlights: Strategy to lock in young users; confident in 4Q growth.<br/><br/>
        We had YY management in Hong Kong for a one day NDR last Friday. Investorquestions focused mainly on strategies
        to drive live streaming growth and gamebroadcasting outlook and competition. YY reiterates that the young
        generationwill be the focus for future product innovations and upgrades. The companywould like to develop YY
        live into a shopping mall in a live streaming spaceto cope with the demand of both core and light live streaming
        users. Corelive show room will remain as the biggest growth driver; new and young usersmeanwhile will have more
        chances to access vertical streaming channels or socialgames. The company expanded the channels to outdoor,
        sports, anime, petsto cope with young people's interest, and leverages social games to enhancetheir sociality.
        YY also sounds very confident regarding 4Q revenue growth.<br/><br/>
        Huya breakeven, however, will likely be postponed to 2Q-3Q 2018 due to recentintensified competition with Douyu
        on top hosts. We expect future growth to bemainly driven by self incubated hosts and more gifting scenarios
        within the gameshow room.<br/><br/>
        4Q and 2018 outlook.<br/><br/>
        The company sounds very confident in 4Q revenue growth. Recall the guidance of37-41% YoY growth. Year end
        ceremony will focus on monetization and thereforethe new product/feature launch will be in 1Q18. We expect ARPU
        to outperformaccordingly; paying users growth should be more mild than 3Q. Huya should beseasonally weak in 4Q.
        4Q margins are likely to be better than expected given lessspending in marketing activities. Management is also
        quite confident regardingDBe 2018 revenue growth of 29%. The biggest uncertainty on margins lies inHuya's gross
        margin due to competition for top hosts.<br/><br/>
        Happy Contest supports both paying users and ARPU; top guild is back toceremony.<br/><br/>
        The rollout of Happy Contest in 2Q was intended to target long tail hosts to createa more interesting live
        content. It expanded fast and wide across the live showrooms. YY has over 1/3 of the hosts playing Happy Contest
        4-5 rounds per day.<br/><br/>
        High paying users, therefore, also become motivated to support their idols to winin the mini games. We note
        Yujia, top 1 guild on the platform, is re-joining theyear end ceremony. Given all the guilds (or MCNs) are
        maturing and managingtheir P&amp;L;, we believe the return of Yujia indicates a better ROI on YY platformthan
        others. We expect more diversified competition for this year-end event.</p>
