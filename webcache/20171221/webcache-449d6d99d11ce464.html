    <p> Power consumption growthpicks up in line with our forecast. In Nov, China¡¯s social power consumption reportedly
        has increased by 4.7% YoY and3.5% MoM (vs. +4.9% YoY and -3.5% MoM in Oct). For 11M17, power consumption growth
        has slightly slowed down to 6.6% YoY (vs. 6.8% of the 10M17). Power consumption in the secondaryindustry
        continuedgrowing mildly(3.6% YoY and 6.9% MoM) in Nov, while the declining pace of all other industries narrowed
        down to 3%-7% MoM in Nov (vs. a drop of 15%-28% MoM in Oct).<br/><br/>
        Coal-fired power up and hydro power down.In line with our expectation, coal-fired power increased by 8.3% MoM
        while hydro power droppedby 19.1% MoM in Nov, due to a declining water inflow entering winter. We anticipate
        this trend will continue in the last month of 2017 and the coal-fired power generation volume is likelyto record
        even faster growth in Dec-17after the suspension of the coal-to-gas project plagued by the natural gas shortages
        in North China.<br/><br/>
        Coal price mildly rebounds in light of cold weather, tight coal supply and natural gas shortage. We think the
        coalsupply was tightin Nov, given the monthhas seencoal output up by 5.8% MoM but down by 2.7% YoY (vs.
        coal-fired power: 8.3% MoM and 4.7% YoY). Even though natural gas has replacedcoal as heating fuel in some areas
        of North China, we expect the downstream demand forcoal to remain strong,citingthe resumption of the coal-fired
        power plants after the shortage of natural gas as well asthe competitive price of coal comparedto natural gas.
        On the other hand, the NDRC issued a notice tothe local governments to set up permitted days of coal
        inventoriesfor coal suppliers and downstreamconsumers, in a bidto mitigate the substantial movementof coal
        prices. Against the backdrop of which, we expect the coal price mightgradually pick up and be capped at RMB630/t
        in the remainder of 2017. Sector picks. The power sector has declined by as much as 7-16% since our last report
        published on 20 Nov. We think the markethas been overacted,given that the coal-fired IPPs¡¯profitability actually
        improvedin 2H17 afterthe coal price stabilisedand the first round of on-grid tariff hikebecoming effective.
        Looking forward to1H18, we think the sector¡¯s profitabilitywill see a substantialYoY increase,given the low
        comparable base of 1H17. In stock picks, we will maintain our Buy rating on Huaneng Power (902.HK, TP: HKD6.00),
        China Resources Power (836.HK, TP: HKD16.00), and Datang Power (991.HK, TP: HKD3.30) given their relatively
        higher utilisation of coal-fired power assets than peers.</p>
