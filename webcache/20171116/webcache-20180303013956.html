    <p> Not too late in the cycle; expect quality growth in 2018.<br/><br/>
        Construction machinery sales bottomed out in 3Q16 and have been growingrapidly, driven mainly by demand from
        infrastructure projects and replacementorders. We identify the key drivers of construction machinery demand and
        ourtop-down analysis suggests the industry will deliver moderate growth next year.<br/><br/>
        Zoomlion would have relatively greater operating leverage as the sector continuesto recover, and we believe the
        valuation gap between Lonking and Zoomlionwill narrow. We upgrade Zoomlion to Buy, as we expect an earnings
        rebound inFY18-19 and asset quality to improve (less bad debt provision). We maintain aHold on Lonking as the
        positives, such as the ability to gain market share andexpand margins, are already factored into its share
        price.<br/><br/>
        Better-than-expected demand with balanced supply.<br/><br/>
        According to China Construction Machinery Association (CCMA), excavator/wheel loader/truck crane sales volume
        surged 100%/45%/122% in 9M17 amidrobust replacement and infrastructure demand. Unlike the oversupply in
        theprevious down-cycle, construction machinery supply was balanced this time. Thisis because, unlike in 2011,
        fewer individual contractors have entered the industry,allowing more rational market competition. Besides this,
        producers' credit salesterms have become much more conservative.<br/><br/>
        Top-down analysis suggests stable growth ahead.<br/><br/>
        Our top-down analysis indicates that downstream demand is likely to remainrobust in 2018E. We expect healthy
        infrastructure project and mining investmentgrowth to continue while real estate investment growth will be
        stable. We forecastsales of excavators/wheel loaders/truck cranes to grow 83%/43%/117% YoY in2017E and
        16%/12%/25% in 2018E.<br/><br/>
        We see a positive earnings outlook for the sector and upgrade Zoomlion to Buy.<br/><br/>
        We see a positive earnings outlook for the construction machinery sector inFY17-19E, and believe the industry's
        earnings quality has improved after sectorconsolidation in its worst period from 2012 to 1H16. We upgrade
        Zoomlion toBuy and increase our target price to HKD4.8 on improving receivables qualityand margins. We maintain
        a Hold on Lonking with a target price of HKD3.6 asits current share price has priced in the strong sales
        outlook. Our target pricesare based on 0.8x/1.6x FY18E P/BV for Zoomlion/Lonking. Upside risks:
        higherinfrastructure/property/mining investment, credit easing and better overseasdemand. Downside risks: credit
        tightening and worse-than-expected demand.</p>
