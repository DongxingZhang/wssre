        The stage has been set for a rate rise at next week¡¯s Inflation Report, and resilientdata over recent weeks has
        cemented market pricing for a 25bp rise to Bank Rate,the first since July 2007. The front end remains steep over
        2018but then flattensfrom the end of 2018onwards. Terminal rate pricing is also limited, implying BankRate
        peaking at 1%, well below the BoE¡¯s 2% inflation target.<br/><br/>

        The ECB announcements did not bring significant surprises. The recalibrationof QE was broadly in line with
        expectations, and rates forward guidance, whilemaintained, was not strengthened. Draghi's commentary suggests
        that at thisstage the Council is not considering a straight reduction of net purchases to zerofrom September,
        but this does not preclude exit by Q12019. There were alsosigns of increased focus on reinvestments which was
        also midly hawkish</p>
