    <p> 3Q17 results showed continued refining margin improvement as well as lower price discount to Brent and lower
        effective tax burden, which more than offset falling E&amp;P; production and higher overhead expenses, with the
        recurring cash burn improving by USD0.85bn qoq, to USD-0.99bn; net leverage ex-pensions (DB-adjusted) improved
        by 0.3x qoq, to 3.7x.<br/><br/>
        Other positive highlights: increase in drilling rigs, five new oil discoveries, two onshore farm-outs awarded, a
        retroactive fiscal benefit granted in August, and a USD231mn divestment (pipeline stake).<br/><br/>
        We expect cash flow to remain more stable, with limited correlation to international oil prices and E&amp;P;
        production in the near term due to high tax burden (mostly top-lined based); key upside/downside risks to our
        base-case revised cash burn estimate of USD1.0-2.0bn/year include the trajectory of costs/expenses and domestic
        fuel prices upon a change of government.<br/><br/>
        Given Pemex¡¯s bonds¡¯ high-beta nature historically and the recent (sooner-than-anticipated) spike in
        election-related noise and market volatility, we prefer to take a more defensive stance on them (despite
        positive fundamental momentum with the current government administration and positive relative value within EM
        credit) in light of future budgeting and domestic fuel price policy uncertainty (associated with mid-2018
        elections) and thus downgrade PEMEX 6.875% ¡®26s and 6.5% ¡®27s to Hold from Buy, while reiterating our Hold
        recommendation on the other PEMEX USD unsecured non-callable fixed-rate bonds with at least USD500mn of amount
        outstanding, and our Sell recommendation on PEMEX perpetual bonds, due to limited option-adjusted relative value
        (to duration) compared to other PEMEX bonds. Within the PEMEX curve, we have a preference for lower-beta
        shorter-duration bonds due 2021 and 2022.<br/><br/>
        Key risk factors: 1) exposure to international oil prices (although largely mitigated by a high tax burden
        applied mostly to the E&amp;P; segment¡¯s top line); 2) negative momentum on E&amp;P; production and refinery
        output due to low capex; 3) high indebtedness (USD106bn interest-bearing debt and USD175bn including pension
        debt, 3.7x interest-bearing net debt to LTM cash operating income before all taxes); 4) recurring cash burn
        (USD0.5-3.5bn/year forecast for the upcoming years for Brent ranging from USD35/bbl to USD60/bbl and production
        depletion ranging from 2% p.a. to 12% p.a., assuming flat refining spreads); 5) budget and domestic fuel policy
        uncertainty associated with Mexican presidential elections in July 2018; and 6) general risks for EM credit,
        including tighter international financing conditions as DM central banks prepare to unwind ultra-easy policy, as
        well as potential outflows from EM bonds as DM relation takes place.</p>
