        declined rapidly withboth potential buyers and sellers adopting a wait-and-see attitude, hikes in
        reconstructionprices in Gangnam drove the overall gains, as Seoul reconstruction prices rose 0.21% w-wlast week,
        climbing for an eighth straight week. That said, gains stayed mostly flat w-w,with the government set to release
