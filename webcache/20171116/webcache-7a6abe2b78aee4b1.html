    <p> Statement of confidence<br/><br/>
        Solid results, decent cash flow and a statement from the Board that, followingthe start- up of the latest wave
        of large projects, it has sufficient confidence inthe outlook for cash flow growth to remove the scrip dividend
        prop. What's notto like? On the back of better than expected earnings, declining Macondo cashspend and notably
        reduced execution risk we upgrade forward earningsestimates and with them our price target, now 545p (was 520p).
        Of coursecommodity volatility continues to present risk. Yet with the business placed toincrease free cash flow
        by c$8bn over the next three years in a $55/bblenvironment the 6% plus dividend yield feels overly generous.
        Buy.<br/><br/>
        Start of the inflexion<br/><br/>
        Re-instating BP as a Buy in April of this year we argued that between decliningMacondo outflows and rising
        project inflows BP¡¯s cash flows should beexpected to inflect, and strongly, as we proceeded through 2017. Six
        monthson and six major start-ups later so that prognosis appears to be comingthrough in results. At c$1.9bn
        Q3¡¯17net income was notably above marketexpectations ($1.6bn) with the cash outflow on Macondo falling sharply
        to$0.6bn for the quarter, a notable reduction on the prior c$2bn/quarterly runrate. Moreover, with its forward
        cash cycle essentially rebalanced for a $50/bblworld we can but take encouragement from the Board¡¯s earlier than
        expecteddecision to offset dilution from future scrip issuance via equity buy-backs.</p>
