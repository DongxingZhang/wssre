    <p> Beneficiaries of the drive for better quality of life During the 19th CPC NationalCongress, President Xi stated
        that China¡¯s new era will be characterized by the competingforces of a push towards providing a better quality
        of life and combating unbalanced andinadequate development. As China moves towards its aim of building a
        well-off society by2020, we believe the push to provide a better quality of life will mean demand upgradesand
        improvements, at first particularly in environmental protection, healthcare, educationand
        telecommunication.<br/><br/>
        What obstacles lie ahead? Getting past the development obstacles ahead will requirethe successful implementation
        of supply-side reform. We believe labor, land, capital andinnovation are areas with particular bottlenecks.<br/><br/>
        Themes to watch The structural rebalancing of demand and supply in the new erasuggests that there are two key
        themes to watch: 1) Supply-side constraint improvement¨C education, land transfer, PPP and green finance,
        advanced manufacturing and strategicemerging industries; 2) Demand upgrades ¨C environmental protection,
        healthcare,education and telecommunication. Wisdom Education (6068 HK, Buy), BJE Water (371HK, NR), Truly (732
        HK, NR), CSPC Pharma (1093 HK, Accumulate), and Tencent (700HK, NR) are likely beneficiaries of these
        themes.<br/><br/>
        Risks Policy execution is slower than expected; industry outlook worse than expected.</p>
