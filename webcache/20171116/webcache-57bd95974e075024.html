    <p> Stock rally fatigue overlooks strong core fundamentals; Buy<br/><br/>
        The lackluster stock reaction immediately following a strong earnings follows thepattern we've seen this
        earnings season - an incremental earnings beat seems tobe having diminishing returns on the stock. The
        accelerated investment may bestunting ROE expansion in coming quarters and could be used as an excuse totake
        profit on the stock, but we'd be buyers. Our revised estimates capture risinginvestment but perhaps not as much
        as the benefits mid-term.<br/><br/>
        Impressive rev growth; still ample room for improving take rate<br/><br/>
        Assuming Alibaba had stable GMV market share, Alibaba would have generatedan excess 34% yoy growth in take rate
        on top of 27% GMV growth to achieveits 61% yoy revenue growth. So as we model out FY2019, we think our 37%yoy
        revenue growth compared to a 21% yoy GMV growth may not be doingBABA full justice for the excess growth they've
        been able to generate and maycontinue to over the next 18months. On top of personalization, BABA continues toadd
        engagement-enhancing content programs such as 88Loyalty Membership.Category expansion is also in full swing with
        management commenting thatTmall is growing 49% yoy thanks to accelerated gains in electronics and
        FMCGsegment.<br/><br/>
        Modeling in accelerated investment<br/><br/>
        Strong top-line growth was matched by investments. While sequential revenuegrowth was RMB5bn, all divisions
        reported near-flat EBITA, suggestingincremental profit was re-deployed to fueling mid-term growth. Our
        updatedforecast now compensates for the accelerated investment. While we raise FY19revenue by RMB33.7bn, our
        non-GAAP EBIT rises by RMB12.7bn to consider~RMB20bn/annum increase in investment that management has guided
        for.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and key risks<br/><br/>
        Ensuring revenue and cost adjust lead to a FY18/19/20EPADS adjustmentof +12%/+8%/+11% respectively. We update
        our SOTP valuation, adjusting toconsolidate Cainiao. We value the core commerce at 33x P/E, AliCloud at 8x
        EV/sales, and 1x CY18-20PEG for Ant Financial. Ensuing target price is lifted to US$209from US$199previously.
        Key downside risk is regulatory intervention, macroslowdown and intensifying competition.</p>
