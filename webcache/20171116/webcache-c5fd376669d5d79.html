    <p> Consumer prices rose by 2.1% m/m in October, above the market consensus in a Reuters poll of 1.9% and close to
        our call of 2.0%. The ending of tax cuts on white goods and currency depreciation were the main reasons for the
        high inflation print, while food inflation was largely unchanged.<br/><br/>
        As a result of the monthly increase the headline inflation rate increased from 11.2% y/y in September to 11.9%.
        We expect the impact of the TRY¡¯s depreciation to put further upward pressure on the headline inflation rate
        ahead such that it peaks slightly above 12% in November. We then expect headline inflation to fall from December
        onwards due to base effects. In addition, the government plans to skip its regular tobacco tax hike in January
        which will support a fall in inflation in the short term. So headline inflation is likely to decline slightly
        below 9.5% in Q1 2018. However, in light of the recent depreciation of the TRY we have revised up our end-2017
        inflation forecast to 11.2%, from 9.8% previously. Our end-2018 forecast at 8.8% is unchanged for now.</p>
