        With US crude oil exports stimulated by a profitable arb against Brent, we are nowseeing the opposite of the
        inventory "visibility" problem. Instead of US inventoriesshowing a surplus while the rest of the world quietly
        draws down, the US hasdeclined year on year in tandem with OECD inventories. The wider WTI-Brentspread helps the
        situation both by stimulating exports and also suppressing theincentive to produce. Thus, US fundamentals are a
        substantial factor behind themore positive backdrop for oil prices.</p>
