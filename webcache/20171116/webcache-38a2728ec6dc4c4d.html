    <p> Introducing the 3rd-round strategic investor with RMB60bn capital increase<br/><br/>
        On 6Nov, Evergrande (Hold; HK$29.2) announced it has introduced a thirdround strategic investor for capital
        increase to its subsidiary ¨C Hengda RealEstate with total capital of RMB60bn (six investors including
        ShandongHighway &amp; Suning at RMB20bn each). This is higher than RMB30-50bn rangeguided during interim results
        briefing. Upon completion, total capital increasein Hengda should amount to RMB130bn, equivalent to 36.54% of
        the enlargedcapital. The third round capital increase is based on a pre-capital increaseconsideration of
        RMB365.19bn. We believe the capital increase couldsignificantly help deleveraging further. Moreover, the company
        alsoguarantees investors that its net profit excluding non-recurrent gains for 2018F/19F /20F will be over
        RMB50/55/60bn respectively. (vs previous terms for2017F/ 2018F /2019F at RMB24.3/30.8/33.7bn). With the largest
        landbank of276mn sqm (among all developers as of 1H17), and strong sales momentum of&gt;CNY500bn in 2017F
        (CNY56.3bn sales in October with YTD of CNY422bn),CNY650bn in 2018F, we believe the company should be able to
        achieve theguided earnings over the next three years (aggregate of RMB165bn). For 2017,the company should be
        able to beat its full-year profit guidance of RMB24.3bn,considering its strong 1H results amid margin expansion.<br/><br/>
        In addition, on 6Oct, Evergrande announced that the Company had grantedshare options to 7,994senior and
        mid-level management personnel (~8% oftotal number employees), which will enable them to subscribe for
        anaggregate of 743,570,000(~5.7% of issued capital) new shares. The exerciseprice is HK$30.2and the share
        options will be exercisable in the next 10yearsin 5tranches. This incentive plan should help company retain
        talent in thiscompetitive market and continue its strong growth momentum.<br/><br/>
