    <p> The ECB announced the recalibration of its asset purchase program (APP), with an open end, starting from January
        2018, as broadly expected: 1) monthly purchases will be halved from EUR 60 bn to EUR 30 bn; 2) purchases will
        last until September 2018, but with an open-end, which could run beyond if necessary<br/><br/>
        More important, in order to continue to provide favorable liquidity and financial conditions, the ECB announced
        to continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities under the APP for an extended period
        well beyond the end of net purchases and as long as necessary<br/><br/>
        Besides, the ECB re-emphasized its guidance on policy rates that the interest rates will be kept well beyond the
        net asset purchases, which should be able to push back any rate hike expectations into 2019 and maintain the
        highly accommodative financial conditions<br/><br/>
        The recalibration mainly reflects the central banks¡¯ confidence in the robust economic growth, but inflation
        remained subdued: although inflation expectations slightly recovered recently due to the weakened euro and the
        rising oil price, but there is still not much evidence to show that underlining inflation is on an upward trend;
        thus, an ample degree of monetary stimulus is still needed<br/><br/>
        The dovish stance came from the reinvestment of maturing securities, which is estimated to be averaged around
        EUR 10 bn per month for 2018; and on top of the net purchases, the gross purchase could be more than EUR 40 bn
        per month, higher than market expectations<br/><br/>
        Market reacted to the dovish recalibration with falling bond yields and further weakening of the euro against
        the dollar</p>
