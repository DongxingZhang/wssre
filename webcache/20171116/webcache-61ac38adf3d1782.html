    <p> Consensus may not fully capture company's growth, short term and long term<br/><br/>
        We raise our target price for CITS by 37.5% to RMB55, from RMB40.Management has publicly guided that its
        duty-free business is likely to seegrowth of over 60% yoy for FY2017. Also, we believe consensus hasn¡¯tfactored
        in profit from Beijing Airport, the potential opening of a downtownduty-free store and the consolidation of
        duty-free in Shanghai Airport. Given itsrobust and sustainable growth, high barriers to entry and attractive
        valuation,CITS has become our conviction Buy for 2018.<br/><br/>
        Profit from BCIA should be higher than the consensus estimate<br/><br/>
        We expect RMB6.6bn duty-free sales from BCIA (T2&amp; T3) in 2018. We believethe market is overly concerned with
        the high concessionaire rate from BeijingAirport: 1) during the transitional 12m, CITS will pay the original
        concessionairerate agreed with Sunrise, and 2) there is still room for GM improvement, giventhe size-up (CITS¡¯
        duty-free GP margin was only c.45% vs. Dufry¡¯s 60% in2016). We estimate RMB623m profit contribution for 2017and
        RMB349m for2018. We believe this has not been factored into WIND/Bloomberg consensus.<br/><br/>
        Haitang Bay¡¯s robust growth may continue all the way to 2020<br/><br/>
        We have grown more confident on Haitang Bay duty-free sales after our recentchannel checks. We expect duty-free
        sales to hit RMB6.55bn in 2017, yoygrowth of 43%, and to grow another 28% in 2018. Our channel check foundthat
        there are two new additions of luxury hotel resorts (new supply of 800-1,000rooms) in Haitang Bay every year to
        meet the strong demand fromdomestic travelers. We also believe Atlantis and Haichang Ocean Park, two
        inprogresstheme parks could add another 5-6m travelers to Haitang Bay. Allthese incremental travelers should
        benefit duty-free sales¡¯ long-term growth.<br/><br/>
        Two more significant catalysts may double current profit ¨C not priced in yet<br/><br/>
        We believe the current share price hasn¡¯t fully factored in two near-mid-termcatalysts: a downtown duty-free
        store and consolidation of duty-free businessin Shanghai Pudong/Hongqiao Airports. These two events are likely
        to bring afurther c.RMB1.2bn in earnings to CITS, which is 35% on top of our 2018E.<br/><br/>
        Valuation and risks<br/><br/>
        Our TP of RMB55implies a forward PER of 24x on our 2018earningsforecasts, which we believe is very attractive,
        given that the duty-free businessis protected and enjoys barriers to entry in China. We derive our TP based
        onDCF (8.1% WACC, 9% cost of equity, beta of 0.9and 3.0% TGR, unchanged).Key downside risks include 1)
        unfavorable government policy, 2) ecommercecompetition, 3) delays in lifting shopping quota, and 4) competition
        from OTAs.</p>
