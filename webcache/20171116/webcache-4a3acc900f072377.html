    <p> ASEAN is likely to feature prominently in worldwide media headlines in November.<br/><br/>
        The 31st ASEAN Summit will be held on November 12-13 in Manila, followed by the EastAsia Summit, which includes
        the 8 regional partners involved in RCEP (the RegionalComprehensive Economic Partnership). President Trump's
        attendance at the ASEANSummit will likely inject a degree of global relevance, but with the region celebrating
        its50th anniversary, now is a good time to focus on an ASEAN-specific story. In this piecewe look at what must
        be done to allow the region to realize its long-elusive potential.<br/><br/>
        In the past we have argued that enhanced integration is necessary to realize thebenefits of a large consumer
        market and production base, in line with the intentions of theASEAN Economic Community. This is a topic we will
        revisit soon. But in this edition ofASEAN Perspectives we take a more granular approach by identifying the top
        threereforms that each country needs to realize in order to fundamentally improve the GDPtrajectory and allow it
        to reach, or sustain, potential growth.<br/><br/>
        Why 3? Ultimately, all governments have limited political capital and constricting electiontimelines, meaning
        they will need to be strategic with their priorities. For example, inIndonesia, c134 million voters across 17
        provinces including most of Java will vote inregional elections in June 2018 - which are likely to serve as
        proxies for presidentialelections in April 2019. An extended campaign period may reduce reform
        appetite.<br/><br/>
        Meanwhile, in Malaysia political hurdles are more imminent. Elections need to be heldby August 2018, with the
        parliament auto-dissolving on 24 June. The recently tabled 2018budget (Delivering the best of both worlds, 27
        October) included various pro-consumermeasures typically associated with election-year budgets, but a higher
        revenue target willallow the government to continue with fiscal consolidation. Opinion polls suggest that
        theBarisan Nasional (BN) coalition may have lost some support over the years, but shouldnonetheless secure a
        majority of seats in the upcoming election (Asia Times, 6 October).<br/><br/>
        Next, Thailand is expected to hold its thrice-delayed general elections in November2018 according to Prime
        Minister Prayuth, with a date to be set in "around June"(Bloomberg, 10 October). Once they are held, private
        industries may opt to realize longpostponedinvestment plans, thereby boosting one of the economy's weakest
        links. In thePhilippines, President Duterte's government still has some time to accelerate crucialreforms before
        mid-term elections in mid-2019. Meanwhile, in Vietnam, things are lesspressing: the next key political milestone
        will be the 13th Party Congress in 2021.</p>
