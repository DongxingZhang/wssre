        Arguably the most consequential surprise across markets this year has beenthe slowdown in inflation. The
        slowdown began in March even as growthstrengthened and the labor market tightened. Lower inflation and the
        subsequentpricing out of Fed hikes saw bond yields become range bound, the dollar fallto the bottom of its 2?
        year range, oil prices rebound, Value significantlyunderperform Growth within equities and the normally strong
        positive bond yieldequitycorrelation plummet. These large cross asset impacts have understandablyled to an acute
        market focus on inflation, its drivers and debate as to its prospects.But it has also led to the perpetuation of
        a large number of myths about inflation,several of them variously emphasized by different members of the FOMC.
