    <p> Bank of England - Britain finally joined the global rate hike party yesterday with aquarter per cent rise.
        Indeed, since the financial crisis, there have been 155 ratehikes by G20 central banks. Only Japan has now
        avoided one. Given GovernorCarney¡¯s many ¡°dovish tightening¡± caveats, most assume a glacial pace of
        furtherhikes. But consider the reluctance of UK business to invest. Before the crisis,capital investment
        contributed one percentage point to productivity; now it hashalved. In effect, business has become more reliant
        on labour which is partly whyproductivity growth has averaged a painfully low 0.4 per cent since the crisis,half
        that of the US. Yet, Britain¡¯s unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent is below thenatural rate. So if Brexit
        exacerbates the workforce supply constraint, inflationarywage pressures may force the Bank of England¡¯s hand
        earlier than expected.<br/><br/>
        US tax reform - Was it a coincidence that US tax reform proposals wereannounced on the same day as ¡®continuity
        candidate¡¯ Powell was given the Fedchair? Recall that the aftermath of Reagan¡¯s 1986 tax cut coincided with the
        1987stock market crash, the thrift industry banking crisis, a real estate slide, and finallya jobless recovery.
        Indeed, economic growth in the six years after Reagan¡¯s cutsaveraged 2.9 per cent, somewhat behind the 3.4 per
        cent of his first six years. Ifthe objective is now to boost growth to compensate for lower tax revenues,
        thetiming of Powell¡¯s announcement makes sense. Furthermore, the corporate taxcut from 35 to 20 per cent is less
        dramatic considering the effective tax rate ofS&amp;P; 500 companies is just 27 per cent. To the extent various
        preferences survive,state governments may go after what the Feds leave behind.</p>
