    <p> With market expectations running very much in line with the FOMC¡¯s latestmedian projection of a rate hike in
        December, the FOMC will have little reasonto either amplify or alter its message in the November statement. We
        expectan uneventful outcome, with primary focus on the tea leaves in the first twoparagraphs: i.e, in how the
        Committee sees recent and prospective economicdevelopments.<br/><br/>
        While recent data have been distorted to some extent by the effects of hurricanes,on the whole, GDP growth has
        been robust and the labor market continues tolook firm with the unemployment rate moving to a new low for the
        current cycle.<br/><br/>
        Household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace through the thirdquarter. Business investment spending
        has picked up strongly and recent ordersfor capital goods and other indicators point to further gains
        ahead.<br/><br/>
        Headline inflation has risen, as anticipated, due to hurricane effects. But yearover-year core PCE inflation
        dropped further in Q3, to 1.3% ¨C significantly belowthe Fed's objective. Core inflation has begun to show some
        tentative signs ofpicking up again in recent months following large downward surprises earlier thisyear,
        however. Various measures of inflation compensation and survey measuresof inflation expectations have changed
        little since the September FOMC meeting,when the Committee last projected a rate increase in December.<br/><br/>
        In financial markets, the stock market is up nearly 3% and the dollar hasappreciated a bit more than 2%. On net,
        overall financial conditions have easedfurther¡ªi.e., moved further in a direction that supports growth ¨C since
        theSeptember meeting.<br/><br/>
        On balance, we expect that the economic picture has not changed enough to alterthe Committee¡¯s central
        expectation that it will be raising rates another 25 bpsin December, and recent Fedspeak from Chair Yellen and
        others has not tried tomodify that perception. With inflation still running low, we expect the statementto
        continue to say that ¡°the Committee is monitoring inflation developmentsclosely,¡± and in our post-meeting
        assessment, we will take a look at what it mighttake to change the expected outcome for December.</p>
