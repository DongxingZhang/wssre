    <p> Key monthly trends:<br/><br/>
        HKMA announced monetary stats for Sep'17, with MoM loan growthrecovering from a flattish number in Aug. However,
        deposit growth failed tomatch the loan momentum, with LDR reaching 72% (Dec'16: 68%), the highestlevel since
        Jun'15.<br/><br/>
        System loans grew 1.1% MoM (+12.8% YTD) ¨C domestic loans were up0.9% MoM (+12.4% YTD), offshore loans increased
        1.2% MoM (+13.9%YTD) and trade finance was up 2.2% MoM (+11.6% YTD). Currency wise,HKD loans grew 1.8% MoM
        (+14.1% YTD) and FX lending was flat (+0.2%MoM, +11.1% YTD).<br/><br/>
        Sector-wise, QoQ domestic loan growth was driven by corporate property(+3.4% QoQ), FIs (+5.9%) and loans to
        individuals (total: +2.9%,mortgages: +2.2%, unsecured: +5.4%), together contributing to 93% ofloan
        growth.<br/><br/>
        System deposits were flat (+0.2% MoM, +6.6% YTD), as FX deposits fell0.9% MoM (+1.6% YTD), offset by growth in
        HKD deposits at 1.1% MoM(+11.7% YTD). The CASA ratio was stable at 57.9% (Aug: 57.7%). Overallsystem LDR edged
        up to 72.4% (Aug: 71.7%), with HKD LDR at 78.8%(Aug¡¯17: 78.3%, Dec¡¯16: 77.1%) and FX LDR at 65.5% (Aug:
        64.8%).<br/><br/>
        RMB deposits increased slightly by 0.5% MoM (-2.1% YTD). RMB timedeposits fell by 1.6% MoM (-7.1% YTD), offset
        by RMB savings deposits,growing 6.2% MoM (+13.2% YTD) with the proportion in time depositsdropping to 71.4%
        (peak: 85% in Sept¡¯14). Offshore RMB deposits nowaccount for 5% (same in Aug) of the system (peak: 12.8% in
        Mar¡¯14).<br/><br/>
        The residential mortgage survey showed outstanding mortgage loansrising by 0.7% MoM (+6.1% YTD); mortgage
        approvals dropped 1.7%MoM and loan drawdowns fell 1% MoM. New loans priced with referenceto HIBOR fell to 93.4%
        (Aug: 95.4%).<br/><br/>
        The composite interest rate remained flat MoM at 0.30% by the end of Sep(Aug: 0.30%). Our deposit cost check
        with sample HK banks in Oct¡¯17showed that deposit rates largely remain the same MoM with the USDrates having
        +~50bp differentials. Please refer to Figure 7for details.<br/><br/>
        Tighter liquidity and rates ¨C Are deposit costs due to pick-up?<br/><br/>
        Since HKMA¡¯s mid-Sept decision to issue additional exchange fund bills,totaling HKD40n, as well as quarter-end
        dressing and IPO activities recently,the 1M/3M HIBOR rose by 37bp/21bp until 31Oct. The discount to LIBOR
        hasnarrowed to 45bp/42bp (mid-Sept: 82bp/57bp) ¨C Figure 1. Liquidity has beentightening, with HKD LDR being the
        tightest it has been since Jul¡¯15and FXLDR reaching 65.5% (highest since Apr¡¯00). While this appears to
        besupportive to margins, we are concerned that the new loans asset yields couldbe lower due to rising loan
        competition while deposit cost could pick up fromslower deposit growth. The recent BoCHK 3Q17operating trends
        also showedNIM pressure
        <link/>
        . As we highlighted in our 2H17outlook note, we believethat although the higher rates are margin-accretive, the
        earnings benefits willnot likely be linear from higher rates. We stay cautious on HK banks, with DahSings as our
        only Buy rated stocks on a discounted valuation vs. peers.
