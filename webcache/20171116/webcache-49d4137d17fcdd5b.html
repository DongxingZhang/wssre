    <p> Beware hyperbole, rumours and paranoia<br/><br/>
        The ANC＊s succession battle is distorting South African politics, in our view, and probablyheightening concerns
        about political risk as a result. We assume that the factions contesting theleadership at the ANC＊s elective
        conference in December are leaking allegations to the mediathat are designed either to strengthen their case or
        weaken the competition. However, suchallegations may not necessarily be untrue. In fact, in this febrile
        politically atmosphere, we wouldexpect confidential information to find its way into the public domain. Our base
        case is 每 expecthyperbole and treat rumours with extreme caution.<br/><br/>
        Here are some of the latest allegations:<br/><br/>
        Reshuffling David Mahlobo from Intelligence to Energy was ＆a Russian plot＊<br/><br/>
        A Sunday Times article (on 22October), quoting unnamed ※government insiders§, claims thatPresident Jacob Zuma＊s
        recent cabinet reshuffle was prompted by a meeting with a ※high-levelRussian team§, which ※came to the country
        to warn Zuma＊s administration to implement theR1trillion nuclear build project§ 每 see here and repeated versions
        not behind a paywall onEyewitness News, The South African and Fin24, also October 22. (NB: all of these stories
        quotean original, unsourced story)<br/><br/>
        Or was it?<br/><br/>
        We have already expressed concerns that Mr Mahlobo＊s appointment raises the risk thatMr Zuma could commit South
        Africa to an unaffordable nuclear deal 每 see South Africa: Statecapture reshuffle. However, the Sunday Times
        story lacks basis, in our view, and hence we findit unconvincing. The Russian embassy in South Africa
        immediately dismissed the claims ofdirect Russian pressure, labelling them variously as ※fake news§,
        ※slanderous§, a ※groundlessanti-Russian attack§, ※ridiculous§ and ※sensationalist 每 see Mail &amp; Guardian,
        October 23.<br/><br/>
        Worst post-apartheid cabinet<br/><br/>
        The last iteration of Zuma＊s cabinet is easily the worst post-apartheid cabinet, in our opinion.Mr Zuma has
        dismissed layer upon layer of competent ministers, either perceiving them aspolitical enemies, or because he
        needed to free up space for an acolyte or wanted a particularpolicy path pursued (out go Pravin Gordhan,
        Nhlanhla Nene and even Blade Nzimande, whileFaith Muthambi, Bathabile Dlamini and Mosebenzi Zwane
        stay).<br/><br/>
        We expect that Zuma＊s final cabinet moves are most likely to be motivated by his own personalagenda to protect
        himself from potential prosecution and to complete the bigger economic dealshe (and his allies) has been
        targeting. Among the many conclusions one could draw from this isthat Mr Zuma is less concerned about how the
        ANC performs in government before the 2019election and more concerned with his own personal agenda.<br/><br/>
        Is Ramaphosa＊s dismissal imminent?<br/><br/>
        As soon as the surprise cabinet reshuffle took place on 17October, rumours began to circulatethat Mr Zuma was
        preparing to dismiss deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. (Note that Mr Zumaonly has the power to dismiss Mr
        Ramaphosa as country deputy president, not as deputypresident of the ANC 每 that can only be done at the national
        conference in December).</p>
