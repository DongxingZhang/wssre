    <p> Market focused on Fed Chair nomination US President Donald Trump is expected toannounce his nomination for the
        next Fed Chair this week. Janet Yellen¡¯s term as Fedchair will end in Feb 2018. Investors expect Trump to choose
        from three candidates: JanetYellen, Fed Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor.
        Inthe past few years, Yellen and Powell have proved that their policy stance is relativelydovish and
        market-friendly. In contrast, Taylor is relatively hawkish, indicating his negativeview on the QE programme
        several times in recent years. Taylor believes the programmedrives down government bond yields meaning little
        incentive for lenders to extend creditat extremely low rates. In addition, according to the famous Taylor rule,
        the Fed FundsRate was lower than the level generated by the model, too. Therefore, if Taylor isnominated, he is
        generally expected to speed up the pace of rate hikes. In the worst case,this could even lead to a ¡°Taylor
        tantrum¡±: US government bond yields rise sharply whilethe US dollar rebounds significantly. This would be
        negative for the Hong Kong stockmarket too. On the other hand, if Powell or Yellen is nominated, we would expect
        stockmarkets to get a boost.<br/><br/>
        Dovish ECB ensures continued favorable liquidity conditions The ECB held its policymeeting last week, and
        announced that it will extend its QE programme for nine monthsuntil Sept 2018, in line with our expectation. The
        monthly pace of net asset purchases willbe cut by half to ?30bn next year, meaning a slowdown in the expansion
        of its balancesheet. Moreover, the central bank has said that the key ECB interest rate will remainunchanged at
        the current level until the QE programme ends. This means the depositfacility rate will remain negative in 2018.
        During the press conference, President MarioDraghi maintained a dovish stance. He said that after a month of
        deliberations, theGoverning Council has decided to keep the QE programme open-ended, and may extendor even
        increase QE purchases if needed. Draghi explained that although economicconditions continue to improve,
        inflation is likely to remain below its target in the mediumterm. We believe the central bank will continue its
        policy normalization in the next fewyears, but at a slow and gradual pace. The dovish ECB will continue to
        provide supportfor the financial markets.<br/><br/>
        Strong earnings pushed up the Hong Kong market Last week, China ConstructionBank (939 HK, NR), China Life
        Insurance (2628 HK, NR) and Ping An Insurance (2318HK, NR) released better-than-expected 3Q17 earnings, leading
        H-shares to outperform.<br/><br/>
        Three banks which account for nearly 20% of the HSI, HSBC (5 HK, NR), ICBC (1398HK, NR) and Bank of China (3988
        HK, NR), will announce 3Q17 results today. We believeHSBC could regain profit growth momentum in the next few
        years, supported by a globaleconomic recovery and higher government bond yields. CCB (939 HK, NR) reported
        solid3Q17 results last week with NPL and NIM continuing to improve QoQ, suggesting a goodchance of similar
        improvements at other major Chinese banks. Further earnings growthmomentum is likely to come from Tencent (700
        HK, NR), which will release its 3Q17results on Nov 15. If earnings performance for these HSI heavyweights
        continues to beatexpectations, we believe the HSI will continue to hit post-crisis highs in Nov. In
        addition,China¡¯s industrial profit grew 27.7% YoY in Sept, 3.7pp faster than in Aug, indicatingcontinued
        strength in corporate earnings, adding further positive factors to the market inthe near term.</p>
