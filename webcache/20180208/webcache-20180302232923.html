    <p> Colombia＊s central bank has been having a tough time communicating its decisions. Last year,the bank has
        surprised markets on several occasions, with decisions frequently dividing boardmembers. Governor Juan Jose
        Echavarr赤a told a press conference last year that it was his jobto make markets understand the bank＊s meeting
        outcomes but not to anticipate the decisions.<br/><br/>
        On Monday, BanRep surprised again. This time, not so much with the cut itself (we did notexpect it just yet, but
        it was coming sooner rather than later), but with the explicit statement atthe press conference afterwards that
        the easing cycle was over, given the information available.<br/><br/>
        We expect inflation to undershoot BanRep＊s implied scenario. Governor Echavarr赤a has said theboard assumes CPI
        inflation of about 3.5每3.6% in March, but our forecasts see it below 3.5%already in February and at 3.3% later
        (see Chart 1). We continue to see inflation risks asactually being skewed to the downside: tamer indexation
        forces than in 2016每17 should helpbring core inflation to about or below 4% (see Colombia: On the cutting edge).<br/><br/>
        Moreover, in our view, if oil prices remain sharply higher than in recent years, board membersmight revise
        upwards their estimates of the country＊s potential growth rate from the current levelof about 3.3%, with some
        already seeing it near 4%. This would lift further the output gap,already open (see Chart 2) estimates and
        reduce inflationary risks in the near term. In addition,it should bring the current account deficit closer to
        estimated sustainable levels (see Latam FXquarterly: FEER update).<br/><br/>
        Higher crude prices could also help inflation dynamics, with terms of trade now more correlatedwith the COP,
        according to our strategists (see, for example, Colombian risk assets: Divergingdrivers, 23 January). Recent
        market dynamics on COP rates have been driven more bydomestic factors than external variables.<br/><br/>
        All things considered, we expect two more cuts to the policy rate this year, 25bp each to end theyear at 4.0%.
        We expect the next one around mid-year 每 we assume June, after the elections,but do not rule out the March or
        April meetings每 and the next one sometime in H2 每 we pencil inthe July meeting, in line with last year＊s
        back-to-back cuts.<br/><br/>
        Risks to this call are high, however. Inflation might not fall as we currently expect, while activitymight
        recover faster than we expect, as oil prices are also correlated with domestic demand. Wesee GDP growth at 2.5%
        this year, against a 2.7% expectation by BanRep. And this time, thecentral bank＊s words could really indicate
        the board＊s approach from now on and signal that wehave reached the end of the cycle 每 an interpretation that we
        think defies its recent erratic record.</p>
