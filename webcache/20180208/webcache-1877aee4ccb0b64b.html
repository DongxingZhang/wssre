    <p> Railcar loadings 4-week moving average -2.1%. Weekly loadings down 5.6%.<br/><br/>
        The 4-week moving avg of chemical railcar loadings decreased 2.1% in Week#4 (ended 1/20/2018) vs. a 0.9%
        increase the prior week. Loadings YTD aredown 2.1%. Chemical railcar loadings represent 20% of total US
        chemicalshipment tonnage (followed by trucks, barges, and pipelines), offering a trendof broader chemical
        industry activity and demand. The more volatile measureof weekly loadings decreased 5.6% YoY (versus a 6.7%
        increase in the priorweek) and decreased 6.0% sequentially (vs.a 12.9% increase in the prior week).<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices up 1 c/gal to 29 c/gal. Propane down 12 c/gal to 82 c/gal.<br/><br/>
        Ethane prices rose 0.8 c/gal last week to 28.5 c/gal (vs its fuel value of 20.6 c/gal) asethane export and
        cracker demand continues to ramp up. While US ethanesupply/demand fundamentals remain loose, ethane rejection,
        which peaked at 600k bpdin 1H16, declined following the 2H16 start-up of a 200k bpd ethane export facility
        inHouston. However, with delays in new ethylene capacity coupled with growing amountsof associated gas rich oil
        and steady production of liquid rich shale gas, ethane rejectionis estimated at ~500k bpd in early 2018. As we
        move thru the year and into 2019, weexpect this long ethane position to erode as 4 world-scale ethylene crackers
        ramp-up inthe US in 2018-19 (combined ethane demand of 355k bpd). As the market tightens, weexpect ethane to
        trade toward its historical premium of ~10c/gal vs its fuel value, withthe premium reflecting fractionation,
        transportation and storage costs. Based on DB¡¯s2018-19 US natural gas price forecasts of $2.98/MMBtu and
        $3.10/MMBtu, respectively,we estimate US ethane prices will average 30 c/gal in 2018 and 31 c/gal in 2019.
        Thiscompares to 24 c/gal in 2017.<br/><br/>
        Propane prices fell 12.3 c/gal last week to 81.8 c/gal due to looser propane balances.<br/><br/>
        With propane inventories down 6% last week to 54MM bbls, they are now 21% and 12%below their 3 and 5-yr avgs,
        respectively. Longer term, we expect propane inventories todecline due to higher exports (+17% in ¡¯17 vs up 20%
        in ¡®16).<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene down 1.3 c/lb to 27.5 c/lb. Margins down 0.1 c/lb to 13.5 c/lb.<br/><br/>
        Spot ethylene prices fell 1.3 c/lb last week to 27.5 c/lb (vs the December contract price of32.5 c/lb). Spot
        deals for January ranged from 28.0 to 29.5 c/lb with deals for February at29.25 c/lb. Average spot ethylene
        margins compressed 0.1 c/lb last week to 13.5 c/lb aslower selling prices more than offset lower production
        costs (lower butane, propane andnaphtha).<br/><br/>
        Polymer grade (PG) propylene spot prices were higher last week with deals for Januarydelivery at 68 c/lb.
        January propylene contract prices settled up 9 c/lb to 59.0 c/lb for PGand 57.5 c/lb for chemical grade from
        December. This follows a total of 10.5 c/lbincreases from September to December, driven by supply tightness due
        to HurricaneHarvey which caused outages at multiple US Gulf Coast olefins and refineries as well asdelaying
        Enterprise¡¯s propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit which had been scheduled tostart up in September (started-up in
        December). In the meantime, an existing PDH unit atDowDuPont¡¯s Freeport, TX site remains offline for maintenance
        and another PDH unit atFHR¡¯s Houston site also had a short shutdown in recent weeks.<br/><br/>
        7.5% of North American ethylene capacity expected to be offline in February.<br/><br/>
        Per IHS, Formosa¡¯s Point Comfort, TX cracker (1.7% of North American {NA} ethylenecapacity) remains offline due
        to an operational upset. In February, Exxon¡¯s Baton Rouge,LA (2.4% of NA ethylene capacity) and Baytown, TX
        (2.9% of NA ethylene capacity)crackers and Huntsman¡¯s Port Neches, TX cracker (0.5% of NA ethylene capacity)
        will beoffline for maintenance. For ¡¯18, IHS forecasts NA ethylene production losses of 4.4B lbs,or 4.8%, of
        capacity. This compares to 5.2B lbs, or 6.2%, of production losses in in ¡¯17and 4.5B lbs, or 5.5%, of ethylene
        capacity offline in ¡¯16.</p>
