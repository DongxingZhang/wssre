    <p> SA 5Y CDS rallied by 48bp relative to CDX EM ex Venesince the recent wides of 13 November, on a risk
        adjustedbasis (Chart 1). It currently trades flat to the tights reachedon 16 February last year, just ahead of
        the cabinet reshuffleat the end of March, when ex-Finance MinisterPravin Gordhan was replaced by a less
        experienced MalusiGigaba. To recall, March 2017 was the starting point of theturmoil that followed, with more
        concerns over cabinetreshuffles, ANC leadership outcome and weak mediumtermbudget. Rating agencies moved to
        downgrade theircredit assessment of South Africa: Fitch downgraded toNon-Investment grade in April, S&amp;P;
        downgraded deeperinto Non-Investment grade in November while Moody¡¯s hasplaced its still Investment Grade Baa3
        rating on CreditWatch Negative in November.<br/><br/>
        The strength of the recent rally is at par with May-16 andNovember-16 relief rallies that were prompted by
        easing ofpolitical concerns. These rallies drove 5Y CDS c.62bp/43%tighter on average with more than half of the
        gains given upin a month that followed each of these rallies (c.40bp onaverage). Given this history and the
        short-term risksdescribed below, we expect a pullback and recommendthat investors Buy South Africa 5Y CDS at
        145bp, targetingc.20bp net widening relative to CDX EM ex-Vene.</p>
