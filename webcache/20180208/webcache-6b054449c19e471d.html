    <p> National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently reported that a total of 17.23m babieswere born in 2017, a slight
        decrease of 0.63m over the total in 2016 (17.86mnewborns). In addition, there were 8.83m second-child births in
        2017, an increaseof 1.62m over 2016.<br/><br/>
        Although there was a slight yoy drop of newborns and birth rate, these twonumbers in 2017 recorded the second
        highest since 2003. After the two-childpolicy started to take effect in 2016, newborn growth was mainly driven
        by thesecond-child births. More than half of Chinese newborns (51.2%) in 2017 aresecond children (vs. c.40% in
        2016). We believe the incremental newborns of1-2m in 2016/17 will soon (in the next 3-5 years) become the
        consumption powerof the pre-school and young children¡¯s education market.</p>
