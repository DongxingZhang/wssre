    <p> Net profit up 58% yoy in 2017; in line with market expectation<br/><br/>
        Kweichow Moutai issued a profit alert on 31Jan 2018and announced that itsnet profit increased 58% yoy to
        Rmb26.4bn in 2017. On quarterly basis, the 4Q17profit grew 51% yoy to Rmb6.4bn. The net profit growth was driven
        by: 1) "FeitianMoutai" sales volume, increased 34% yoy to 31,000tons; 2) 10% ASP increaseof Moutai liquor due to
        increasing sales portion of super premium products; and3) Lower SG&amp;A;/sales ratio due to improved operating
        efficiency and operatingleverage.<br/><br/>
        The result was in line with its operation update announcement in Dec 2017ofa 58% yoy increase in profit before
        tax. It is also in line with our forecast atRmb26.2bn in 2017and market's consensus (Wind) at
        Rmb25.4bn.<br/><br/>
        Long-term growth potential remains intact<br/><br/>
        We think the strong net profit growth is not a surprise to the market. We maintainBuy on the stock for its
        strong branding and increasing channel control; yet inthe near-term, the potential over supply risk might assert
        pressure on its retailprice and market sentiments. We maintain our target price at Rmb790based onDCF model
        (factoring in 9.5% WACC and a 2% terminal growth rate). Downsiderisks: shorter-than-expected restocking cycle;
        government policy changes; foodsafety incidents.</p>
